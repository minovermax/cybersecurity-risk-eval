{"cik": "1692115", "company": "Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nDescribed below (and in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this report) are risk factors that we have identified that may have a negative impact on our future financial performance or affect whether we achieve the goals or expectations expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements contained herein. References below to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d should be read to refer to Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and any combination of its subsidiaries, including Southwest Gas Corporation, MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company, and Centuri Group, Inc.\nOperational Risks\nSouthwest relies on having access to interstate pipelines\u2019 transportation capacity. If these pipelines and related transportation capacity were not available, it could impact Southwest\u2019s ability to meet customers\u2019 full requirements.\nSouthwest must acquire both sufficient natural gas supplies and interstate pipeline capacity to meet customer requirements. We must contract for reliable and adequate delivery capacity for our distribution system, while considering the dynamics of the interstate pipeline capacity market, our own on-system resources, as well as the characteristics of our customer base. Interruptions to or reductions of interstate pipeline service caused by physical constraints, excessive customer usage, or other force majeure could reduce our normal supply of gas. Restrictions placed on pipelines or the extractive and mid-stream industries could disrupt our business and reduce cash flows and earnings. A prolonged interruption or reduction of interstate pipeline service or availability of natural gas in any of our jurisdictions, particularly during the winter heating season, would reduce cash flow and earnings.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified employee workforce could adversely affect our collective operations.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers is dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and impacts our ability to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our aging employees retire. Failure to attract, hire, and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business.\nIn particular, the productivity of Centuri\u2019s labor force and its ongoing relationship with clients is largely dependent on those serving in foreman, general foreman, regional, and executive level management positions. The ability to retain these individuals, due in large part to the competitive nature of the utility infrastructure service business, is necessary for the ongoing\nsuccess and growth of Centuri. Further, the competitive environment within which Centuri performs work creates pricing pressures, specifically when its unionized business segment is bidding against non-union competitors. This competition could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe availability of resources for employees or professional contractors could impact our ability to efficiently and effectively integrate MountainWest and execute on the necessary administrative stand up.\nLoss of one or more significant customers at Centuri or MountainWest could adversely affect results.\nDuring 2021, over half of utility infrastructure services revenues were generated from nine customers. This concentration of risk could impact operating results if construction work slowed or halted with one or more of these customers, if competition for work increased, or if existing contracts were not replaced or extended.\nMountainWest has fewer than 200 customers with nearly half of expected revenues from two customers. This concentration of risk could impact future operating results if demand for transmission and storage services diminished, if additional competition materialized, or if demand was otherwise reduced.\nFixed-price contracts at Centuri are subject to potential losses that could adversely affect results of operations.\nCenturi enters into a variety of types of contracts customary in the underground utility construction industry. These contracts include unit-priced contracts (including unit-priced contracts with revenue caps), time and material (cost plus) contracts, and fixed-price (lump sum) contracts. Contracts with caps and fixed-price arrangements can be susceptible to constrained profits, or even losses, especially those contracts that cover an extended-duration performance period. This is due, in part, to the necessity of estimating costs far in advance of the completion date (at bid inception). Unforeseen inflation, or other costs unanticipated at inception, can detrimentally impact profitability for these types of contracts.\nThe nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage operations are subject to inherent hazards and risks such as gas leaks, fires, natural disasters, catastrophic accidents, explosions, pipeline ruptures, and other hazards and risks that may cause unforeseen interruptions, personal injury, or property damage. Our utility infrastructure services operations are reliant on skilled personnel who are trained and qualified to install utility infrastructure under established safety protocols and operator qualification programs, and in conformance with mandated engineering design specifications. Lapses in judgment or failure to follow protocol could lead to warranty and indemnification liabilities or catastrophic accidents, causing property damage or personal injury. Additionally, our facilities, machinery, and equipment, including our pipelines, are subject to third-party damage from construction activities, vandalism, or acts of terrorism. Such incidents could result in severe business disruptions, significant decreases in revenues, and/or significant additional costs to us. Any such incident could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, earnings, and cash flows. In addition, any of these or similar events could result in legal claims against us, cause environmental pollution, personal injury or death claims, damage to our properties or the properties of others, or loss of revenue by us or others.\nThe Company maintains liability insurance that covers both Southwest and MountainWest for some, but not all, risks associated with the operation of our natural gas pipelines and facilities, and the utility infrastructure services we provide. In connection with these liability insurance policies, each entity is responsible for an initial deductible or self-insured retention amount per incident, after which the insurance carriers would be responsible for amounts up to the policy limits. Liability insurance policies at Southwest and MountainWest require us to be responsible for the first $1 million (self-insured retention) of each incident plus the first $4 million in total claims above our self-insured retention in the policy year; while Centuri\u2019s self-insured retention amount is $750,000 per occurrence. We cannot predict the likelihood that any future event will occur which will result in a claim exceeding these amounts; however, a large claim for which we were deemed liable would reduce our earnings up to and including these self-insurance maximums.\nWeather conditions in our operating areas can adversely affect operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nCenturi\u2019s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows can be significantly impacted by changes in weather that affect the ability of Centuri to provide utility companies with contracted-for trenching, installation, and replacement of underground pipes, as well as maintenance services for energy distribution systems. Generally, Centuri\u2019s revenues are lowest during the first quarter of the year due to less favorable winter weather conditions. These conditions also require certain areas to scale back their workforce at times during the winter season, presenting challenges associated with maintaining an adequately skilled labor force when it comes time to re-staff its work crews following the winter layoffs.\nConversely, Southwest\u2019s revenues are highest during the first and fourth quarters of the year during the winter months as customer consumption increases. While Southwest has decoupling mechanisms in place in all three states in which it operates, warmer than normal weather can reduce the amount of billed revenue, as well as amounts collected or returned related to regulatory tracking mechanisms under various programs, thereby impacting cash flows. Deviations from normal weather\nconditions and the seasonal nature of these businesses can create fluctuations in short-term cash requirements of both Southwest and Centuri, and earnings, primarily related to Centuri.\nA cybersecurity incident has the potential to disrupt normal business operations, expose sensitive information, and/or lead to physical damages, and may result in legal claims or damage to our reputation.\nAs a utility provider, midstream service provider, and infrastructure services provider, maintaining business operations is critical for our customers, business partners, suppliers, and our employees. A disruption in service could adversely impact our reputation, ability to provide services for our customers, and the media used to communicate and exchange information both internally and externally.\nWe process and store sensitive information, including personal identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), intellectual property, and business proprietary information as part of normal business operations. A cybersecurity breach of this information could expose us to monetary and other damages from customers, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and others. The federal and state legislative and regulatory environment surrounding PII, information security, and data privacy is evolving and is likely to become increasingly demanding. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020 and requires covered businesses to, among other things, provide disclosures to California consumers regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of such consumers\u2019 PII and afford such consumers new rights, including the right to opt out of certain sales of PII. Additional states are also considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information. Should the Company experience a breach and/or become subject to additional regulation, it could face substantial compliance costs, reputational damage, and uncertain litigation risks.\nPhysical damage due to a cybersecurity incident or acts of cyber terrorism could impact utility, transmission, storage, and related services provided to customers and could lead to material liabilities. The Company has taken the initiative in fortifying the core infrastructure that supports the provision of these services. While these measures provide layers of defense to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that the measures will be effective against any particular cyber attack. Even though we have insurance coverage in place for cyber-related risks, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, the Company\u2019s operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance.\nReliance on third-party suppliers and subcontractors.\nWhile Centuri maintains oversight of those third-party suppliers and subcontractors it utilizes to assist with certain aspects of the work it performs for clients, any delay or failure by these parties in the completion of their portion of a given project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or cause us to incur additional costs, thereby potentially impacting Centuri\u2019s overall profitability. Furthermore, if Centuri\u2019s relationship with its third-party suppliers and subcontractors were to be damaged, it may be difficult to replace them in a cost-effective manner.\nReliance on similar services, and their availability, may also impact the ability of Southwest and MountainWest to execute on their objectives for projects undertaken.\nDisruptions in labor relations with Centuri\u2019s employees could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe majority of Centuri\u2019s labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements with labor unions, which is typical of the utility infrastructure services industry. Labor disruptions, boycotts, strikes, or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases at Centuri, whether due to employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on Centuri\u2019s business and results of operations and cash flows.\nChanging and uncertain work environment and conditions at Centuri.\nCenturi performs work in a variety of geographic locations, each presenting unique environmental, surface, and subsurface conditions. As a consequence of work being performed under change orders when unexpected conditions are encountered, Centuri periodically experiences delays relating to billing and payment under these altered conditions.\nFinancial, Economic, and Market Risks\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness maturing in the near term, which may expose us to the risk of default, and could adversely affect our financial condition, restrict our operations and our ability to obtain additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nSouthwest Gas Holdings has approximately $2.125 billion of consolidated indebtedness maturing in 2022, consisting of $250 million outstanding under Southwest\u2019s term loan that matures on March 25, 2022, $275 million of notes that mature in 2022, and $1.6 billion outstanding under that certain 364-day term loan credit agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of Questar Pipelines that matures on December 30, 2022. These near-term maturities increase the risk of a potential default on our indebtedness, which could cause our lenders to accelerate our indebtedness and seek remedies against us, which\nwould have a material impact on our credit ratings, financial condition, and operations. Furthermore, these near-term maturities may limit our ability to quickly react to changing market conditions, distract management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations and limit our ability to obtain financing for our ordinary course capital requirements. For example, in February 2021, Southwest was required to execute a $250 million term loan in reaction to rising gas prices resulting from unexpected weather-related events. If something similar were to happen prior to the refinancing of some of our current indebtedness, we can provide no assurances that we would be able to secure this kind of short-term financing because of our existing 2022 maturities.\nWe plan to satisfy our 2022 maturities by issuing a combination of equity and equity-linked instruments, entering into new long-term debt agreements, and the issuance of debt securities. While we believe that our plans to refinance this indebtedness are probable, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain the necessary financing on attractive terms or at all. Our plans to refinance are subject to the conditions in the capital and credit markets, which have been volatile to date in 2022 due to, among other things, expected increases in interest rates. As a result we may be forced to obtain capital on terms that are unattractive or that are dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, we may need to pursue other alternatives to satisfy these near-term maturities if we are unable to access the capital markets.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate business acquisitions into our business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nThe Questar Pipelines and Riggs Distler acquisitions are expected to result in various benefits, including, among other things, being accretive to earnings in future periods. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses are integrated efficiently and effectively. We entered into a transition services agreement with the Questar Pipelines\u2019 previous owners covering a period of time post-acquisition. Upon the expiration of the transition services agreement, we may not be able to hire or retain sufficient staff to operate the Questar Pipelines businesses efficiently. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated, and the potential diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, all of which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, credit ratings, or market price of our common stock. The acquisitions may also cause us to issue equity securities which would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership.\nAs a holding company, Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. depends on operating subsidiaries to meet financial obligations.\nSouthwest Gas Holdings, Inc. has no significant assets other than the stock of operating subsidiaries and is not expected to have significant operations on its own. Southwest Gas Holdings\u2019 ability to pay dividends to stockholders is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to service debt and pay upstream dividends. Because of the relative size of subsidiary operations, and their relative impacts to net income and cash flows, substantial dependency on the utility operations of Southwest Gas Corporation and the infrastructure services of Centuri Group, Inc. exists. The ability of Southwest Gas Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends and make other distributions are subject to relevant debt covenant restrictions of subsidiaries and applicable state law.\nUtility infrastructure segment clients\u2019 budgetary constraints, regulatory support or decisions, and financial condition could adversely impact work awarded.\nThe majority of Centuri\u2019s clients are regulated utilities, whose capital budgets are influenced significantly by the various public utility commissions. As a result, the timing and volume of work performed by Centuri is largely dependent on the regulatory environment in its operating areas and related client capital constraints. If budgets of Centuri\u2019s clients are reduced, or regulatory support for capital projects and programs is diminished, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the impact of new regulatory and compliance requirements could result in productivity inefficiencies and adversely impact Centuri\u2019s results of operations and cash flows, or timing delays in their realization.\nSouthwest\u2019s and MountainWest\u2019s liquidity, and in certain circumstances our earnings, may be reduced from historical amounts or expectations during periods in which natural gas prices are rising significantly or are more volatile.\nIncreases in the cost of natural gas may arise from a variety of factors, including weather, changes in demand, the level of production and availability of natural gas, transportation constraints, transportation capacity cost increases, federal and state energy and environmental regulation and legislation, the degree of market liquidity, natural disasters, wars and other catastrophic events, national and worldwide economic and political conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, and the success of our strategies in managing price risk.\nRate schedules in each of Southwest\u2019s service territories contain purchased gas adjustment clauses which permit Southwest to file for rate adjustments to recover increases in the cost of purchased gas. Increases in the cost of purchased gas have no direct impact on our profit margins, but do affect cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of our capital resources. Southwest has used short-term borrowings in the past to temporarily finance increases in purchased gas costs, and we expect to do so during 2022, if the need again arises.\nSouthwest may file requests for rate increases to cover the rise in the cost of purchased gas. Due to the nature of the regulatory process, there is a risk of disallowance of full recovery of these costs during any period in which there has been a substantial run-up of these costs or our costs are more volatile. Any disallowance of purchased gas costs would reduce cash flows and earnings.\nSouthwest\u2019s earnings may be materially impacted due to volatility in the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance policies during periods in which stock market changes are significant.\nSouthwest has life insurance policies on members of management and other key employees to indemnify ourselves against the loss of talent, expertise, and knowledge, as well as to provide indirect funding for certain nonqualified benefit plans. Cash surrender values are directly influenced by the investment portfolio underlying the insurance policies. This portfolio includes both equity and fixed income (mutual fund) investments. As a result, the cash surrender value (but not the net death benefits) moves up and down consistent with the movements in the broader stock and bond markets. Current tax regulations provide for tax-free treatment of life insurance (death benefit) proceeds. Therefore, changes in the cash surrender value components of company-owned life insurance policies, as they progress towards the ultimate death benefits, are also recorded without tax consequences. Currently, we intend to hold the company-owned life insurance policies for their duration. Changes in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance policies, except as related to the purchase of additional policies, affect our earnings but not our cash flows.\nThe cost of providing pension and postretirement benefits is subject to changes in pension asset values, changing demographics, and actuarial assumptions which may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nSouthwest provides pension and postretirement benefits to eligible employees. The costs of providing such benefits are subject to changes in the market value of our pension fund assets, changing demographics, life expectancies of beneficiaries, current and future legislative changes, and various actuarial calculations and assumptions. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, withdrawal rates, interest rates, and other factors. These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense or other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods. For example, lower than assumed returns on investments and/or reductions in bond yields could result in increased contributions and higher pension expense which would have a negative impact on our cash flows and reduce net income.\nUncertain economic conditions may affect Southwest\u2019s ability to finance capital expenditures.\nSouthwest\u2019s business is capital intensive. Our ability to finance capital expenditures and other matters will depend upon general economic conditions in the capital markets. Declining interest rates are generally believed to be favorable to utilities while rising interest rates are believed to be unfavorable because of the high capital costs of utilities. In addition, our authorized rate of return is based upon certain assumptions regarding interest rates. If interest rates are lower than assumed rates, our authorized rate of return in the future could be reduced. If interest rates are higher than assumed rates, it will be more difficult for us to earn our currently authorized rate of return. Furthermore, declines in our stock price resulting from economic downturns or otherwise could impact our ability to finance our operations as planned. We frequently use our at-the-market equity offering program to fund certain liquidity requirements, but we may not continue to do so if our stock is not trading at levels that we find attractive. If we were to decide not to use our equity offering program, we would need to find alternative sources of capital.\nSome of our debt carries a rate of interest linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and has a maturity date after December 31, 2021. If a change in indices, including a discontinuation of LIBOR, which may occur after 2021, results in interest rate increases on our debt, debt service requirements will correspondingly increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nIn October 2021, Carl Icahn and certain affiliated entities initiated a tender offer to purchase shares of our common stock and threatened a proxy contest with respect to the election of directors at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Responding to actions such as these and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. Perceived uncertainties among current and potential customers, employees, and other parties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility, which could disrupt out plans to access the capital markets for financing purposes.\nCOVID-19 and the impacts to our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition remains uncertain.\nThe novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic has been ongoing since the first quarter of 2020 and management has remained focused on the impacts to local and U.S. economies.\nOur utility and pipeline and storage operations and, to a large extent, our utility infrastructure services segment have been deemed \u201cessential services.\u201d Our businesses, consistent with federal and state guidelines and protocols, have been ongoing during this time providing services to meet the demand of customers in all operating territories. Demand at Southwest and Centuri has not significantly decreased. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted some of our customers\u2019 ability to timely pay their bills. Southwest has implemented flexible payment plan options and continues to coordinate with certain governmental and nonprofit entities for customer payment assistance. To date, there has not been a material impact on our financial position overall. Although we may be able to seek recovery of some losses through the regulatory process, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to recover such losses in full or at all. In addition, there has not been a significant disruption in the Company\u2019s supply chains, transportation network, or ability to serve customers.\nFurthermore, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a limited number of construction projects in our utility infrastructure services segment were delayed. Crews were temporarily reduced; however, most work continued, while following governmental protocols. We can provide no assurances as to whether future delays will occur or as to the impact of such delays. Our ability to perform work for which we are contracted could also be impacted by the pandemic if our workforce experiences significant infection.\nThe extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments. We are not able at this time to estimate the effect of these factors on our business, but the adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material.\nAdditionally, any future pandemics could result in similar conditions to those described above.\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks\nThe Company is currently subject to, and may in the future be subject to, litigation or threatened litigation, which may result in liability exposure that could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to, and may be subject in the future, to litigation or threatened litigation, including claims brought by stockholders and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. In particular, we are subject to ongoing shareholder litigation stemming from the acquisition of Questar Pipelines and are subject to a risk of additional shareholder litigation in the future. Although we believe that adequate insurance coverage is maintained to protect against risk exposure, it is difficult to predict with absolute certainty the costs associated with litigation, indemnity obligations, or other claims asserted in any given year. Moreover, it is possible that not all liabilities and costs experienced will be covered by third-party insurance and potential further claims against us may result in significant additional defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which may not be, or cannot be, insured against. Additionally, whether or not any dispute actually proceeds to litigation, we may be required to pay damages or expenses, which may be significant, or involve our agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if in excess of insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby having an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, our common stock. As a consequence, liability exposure could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations to the extent it is not fully mitigated by such insurance coverage. For more information about our ongoing legal proceedings, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies included in the consolidated financial statements of the 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders.\nGovernmental policies and regulatory actions can reduce Southwest\u2019s and/or MountainWest\u2019s earnings or cash flows.\nRegulatory commissions set our utility customer rates and determine what we can charge for our rate-regulated services. Our ability to obtain timely future rate increases depends on regulatory discretion. Governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of the ACC, CPUC, PUCN, and FERC relating to allowed rates of return, rate structure, purchased gas and investment recovery, operation and construction of facilities, present or prospective wholesale and retail competition including electrification or decarbonization policies or proposed policies by governmental entities or other parties, changes in tax laws and policies (including regulatory recovery or refunds thereof), and changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws, including state or federal EPA or PHMSA regulations, and regulations placed on us or our customers regarding the product we deliver in meeting customer energy needs could reduce our earnings. Risks and uncertainties relating to delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approvals, conditions imposed in regulatory approvals, and determinations in regulatory investigations can also impact financial performance. The timing and amount of rate relief can materially impact results of operations. The timing and amount associated with the recovery of regulatory assets and associated with the return of regulatory liabilities can materially impact cash flows.\nIn general, we are unable to predict what types of conditions might be imposed on Southwest or MountainWest or what types of determinations might be made in pending or future regulatory proceedings or investigations. We nevertheless believe that it is not uncommon for conditions to be imposed in regulatory proceedings, for our regulated operations to agree to conditions as part of a settlement of a regulatory proceeding, or for determinations to be made in regulatory investigations that reduce our\nearnings and liquidity. For example, we may request recovery of a particular operating expense in a general rate case filing that a regulator disallows, negatively impacting our earnings if the expense continues to be incurred. Southwest and MountainWest record regulatory assets in the consolidated financial statements to reflect the ratemaking and regulatory decision-making authority of the regulators, or expected ratemaking treatment to be upheld, as allowed by U.S. GAAP. The creation of a regulatory asset allows for the deferral of costs which, absent a mechanism to recover such costs from customers in rates approved by regulators, would be charged to expense in the consolidated income statement in the period incurred. If there was a change in regulatory positions surrounding the collection of these deferred costs, there could be a material impact on financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSouthwest may not be able to rely on rate decoupling to maintain stable financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nManagement has worked with regulatory commissions in designing rate structures that strive to provide affordable and reliable service to our customers while mitigating the volatility in prices to customers and stabilizing returns to investors. Rate structures in all service territories allow Southwest to separate or \u201cdecouple\u201d the recovery of operating margin from natural gas consumption, though decoupled structures vary by state. In California, authorized operating margin levels vary by month. In Nevada and Arizona, the decoupled rate structures apply to most customer classes on the basis of margin per customer, which varies by month. Collectively, these mechanisms provide stability in annual operating margin. Significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions in our service territories and other factors, such as climate change and alternative energy sources, may result in decreased cash flows attributable to lower natural gas sales and delays in recovering regulatory asset balances. Furthermore, continuation of the decoupled rate designs currently in place is subject to regulatory discretion, and if unfavorably modified or discontinued, could adversely impact Southwest\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nSouthwest and MountainWest may be subject to increased costs related to the operation of natural gas pipelines under recent regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nWe are committed to consistently monitoring and maintaining our distribution and transmission systems and storage operations to ensure that natural gas is acquired, stored, and/or delivered safely, reliably, and efficiently. Due to the combustible nature of our (or our customers\u2019) product, we anticipate that the natural gas industry could be the subject of increased federal, state, and local regulatory oversight over time. We continue to work diligently with industry associations and federal, state, and local regulators to ensure compliance with any applicable laws. We expect there to be increased costs associated with compliance (and potential penalties for any non-compliance) with applicable laws. If these costs are not recoverable in our customer rates, or if there are delays in recoverability due to regulatory lag, they could have a negative impact on our operating costs and financial results, including against our expectations.\nOur delivery and related systems require numerous permits and other approvals from various federal, state, and local governmental agencies, and others to operate its business, including for pipeline expansion or infrastructure development; any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals, or other factors that could prevent or delay planned development, could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nSouthwest\u2019s existing and planned development projects require multiple permits and approvals. The acquisition, ownership and operation of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities require numerous permits, rights-of-way, approvals and certificates from federal, state, and local governmental agencies or others. Various factors may prevent or delay us from completing such projects or may make completion more costly, including the inability to obtain approval, public opposition to the project, regulatory opposition to one or more projects or related programs or their delayed recovery and returns thereon, inability to obtain adequate financing, competition for labor and materials, construction delays, cost overruns, and inability to negotiate acceptable agreements relating to rights-of-way, construction, or other material development components. Once received, approvals may be subject to litigation, and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed. If there is a delay in obtaining any required approvals, or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals, easements or rights of way, or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, may not be able to adequately service existing customers or support customer growth, or such conditions could cause us to incur additional costs. These circumstances could negatively impact our earnings.\nGeneral Risks\nWe may not be able to complete a separation of Centuri from Southwest Gas Holdings on the expected timeline or at all.\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors determined to separate Centuri from Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and has authorized management to complete the separation within the next nine to twelve months. Management intends to evaluate various alternatives to determine the optimal structure to maximize stockholder value. Depending on the form the separation takes, it will likely be subject to a number of conditions. There can be no assurances that the Company will\nbe able to successfully separate Centuri on the anticipated timeline or at all. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that any separation of Centuri would lead to the benefits to stockholders that management currently anticipates.\nThe Company may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions, the success of which may impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe integration of acquisitions, including the integration of MountainWest, requires significant time and resources. Investment of resources would be required to support any acquisition, which could result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. If we fail to successfully integrate companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition could be impaired. We assess existing goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an operating segment below its carrying value. We also assess long-lived assets, including intangible assets associated with acquisitions, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset\u2019s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets becomes impaired, the impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may be adversely impacted by an economic downturn.\nIf an economic slowdown occurs, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Fluctuations and uncertainties in the economy make it challenging for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and to identify risks that may affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any future economic slowdown. If the economy or the markets in which we operate decline from present levels, it may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may be adversely impacted by prolonged inflationary periods.\nIf inflation occurs and/or persists for extended periods, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. These fluctuations and uncertainties make it difficult for us to plan and may limit our ability to timely incorporate increases in costs in our customer rates and pricing. These conditions may adversely impact our results and cash flows.\nA significant reduction in Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and Southwest\u2019s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that any of our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Our credit ratings are subject to change at any time in the discretion of the applicable ratings agencies.
