{"cik": "315374", "company": "HURCO COMPANIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-01-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn this section, we describe what we believe to be the material risks related to our business. The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nPublic health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWidespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities in jurisdictions where our facilities, customers, and suppliers are located have imposed mandatory closures, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing protocols that significantly limit the movement of people, goods, and services or otherwise restrict normal business operations or consumption patterns.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and will likely continue to affect our business. Specifically, many of our sales and service organizations throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific have, at one time or another, been subject to temporary closures or otherwise been required to adopt remote work strategies. And, we may continue to experience additional temporary facility closures in response to government mandates and/or the incidence of additional contagion spread.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and could in the future disrupt our ability to deliver and/or install machines, our procurement of supplies for our operations, and our customers\u2019 purchasing behavior or decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significantly reduced demand for our products, which could continue for an extended period of time. Any or all of the foregoing in jurisdictions where we or our customers, suppliers, or business partners are located have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nSignificant increases in economic and demand uncertainty have led to disruption and volatility in the global credit and financial markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital for both our company and our customers and suppliers. In addition, resulting changes in our access to or cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors could cause our goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down goodwill for the amount of the impairment. The duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and, therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate its potential impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, but such impact has been, and could continue to be, material.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and International Operations\nThe cyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations and financial condition, which could re-occur in the future.\nUncertain global economic conditions may adversely affect overall demand.\nWe typically sell the majority of our larger, high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region. Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European, and Asian Pacific markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations pose additional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.\nDuring fiscal 2020, approximately 61% of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the Americas. In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are located outside of the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf trade barriers;\n\u25cf regional economic uncertainty and nationalistic trade strategies;\n\u25cf differing labor regulation;\n\u25cf governmental expropriation;\n\u25cf domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;\n\u25cf current and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials;\n\u25cf difficulty in obtaining distribution support;\n\u25cf difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u25cf differences in the availability and terms of financing;\n\u25cf political instability and unrest;\n\u25cf negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties or the imposition of countervailing measures or anti-dumping duties or similar tariffs;\n\u25cf foreign exchange controls that make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash;\n\u25cf changes in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and\n\u25cf changes in the European Union and Asia may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between countries.\nQuotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers could require us to attempt to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw from or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us and/or that we might not be able to accomplish in a timely manner or at all. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operating results. The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to four ports of destination: Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; Venlo, the Netherlands; and Shanghai, China. Changes in customs requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, tariffs or duties, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nFluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues.\nOur sales to customers located outside of the Americas, which generated approximately 61% of our revenues in fiscal 2020, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counterparty failure. There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects.\nWe compete with larger companies that have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors\u2019 actions.\nThe markets in which our products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, most of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and some of which have been supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financial resources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive.\nThe United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrew from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The U.K. and E.U. agreed to participate in a transition period (the \u201cTransition Period\u201d), due to expire on December 31, 2020, to negotiate a trade agreement and other aspects of their future relationship. During the Transition Period, free trade has continued and will continue between the U.K. and E.U. without checks or extra charges. Following the Transition Period, the U.K. will no longer be a part of the single market and customs union of the E.U. In December 2020, the U.K. and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues (the \u201cDecember 2020 Brexit Deal\u201d) - potentially avoiding some of the anticipated disruption of a no-deal, \u201chard\u201d Brexit.\nWe have operations in the U.K. related to Hurco Europe Ltd. (\u201cHEL\u201d), our sales and service business unit located there. Changes resulting from Brexit and the newly-announced December 2020 Brexit Deal could subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of Brexit and the December 2020 Brexit Deal on us, our subsidiaries, including HEL, our business, and our future operations, operating results, and cash flows.\nIn addition, we do not know if the U.K. and E.U. will succeed in negotiating certain terms not addressed or covered by the December 2020 Brexit Deal. Changes in these other terms resulting from Brexit after the Transition Period could, similarly, subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing.\nBrexit may cause fluctuations in the value of the U.K. pound sterling and E.U. euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our expenses, earnings, cash flows, results of operations, and revenues. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to some of our foreign currency exchange risks through hedging arrangements, our hedging arrangements may not target the potential impacts associated with fluctuations in currency resulting from Brexit or otherwise effectively offset the adverse financial impacts.\nOperational and Strategic Risks\nOur competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.\nThe machine tool industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers\u2019 requirements, and competitors\u2019 product offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, are significant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects, and we may not be able to accomplish those actions on a timely basis or at all. If the technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements, trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to claims that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, reduce the market value of our products and services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDisruptions in our manufacturing operations or the supply of materials and components could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HML, NHML, Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S., and Italy, respectively. We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL, and other key third-party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives, for our machine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in the price of raw materials, especially steel and iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability.\nWe manufacture products with a high iron and steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages, and tariffs or other trade restrictions. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot. If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe unanticipated loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe unexpected loss of members of our senior management team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following\n\u25cf difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or being subjected to liability for the target\u2019s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u25cf potential difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development;\n\u25cf difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\u25cf insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and\n\u25cf the potential for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment.\nAcquisitions may also cause us to:\n\u25cf issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u25cf assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company;\n\u25cf record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u25cf incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u25cf incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and\n\u25cf become subject to litigation.\nFor example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a one-time $4.9 million non-cash impairment charge on goodwill arising from prior acquisitions. The goodwill impairment charge was attributable primarily to the prolonged ongoing uncertainty in the global markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business.\nRisks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor entitled, \u201cDue to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.\u201d\nFailure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business.\nA number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information and other personal information. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individual victims, and at times regulators, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive personal data. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and largely took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners. Regulations from the California Attorney General have not been finalized, and it is expected that additional amendments to the CCPA will be introduced in 2020. Meanwhile, over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the CCPA, We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.\nOutside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), also apply to some of our operations. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.\nThe interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nIf our network and system security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees\u2019, customers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nAs part of our business, we store our data and certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks, including loss of business, litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information.\nLike other public, multi-national corporations, we have and/or will continue to be subject to, instances of phishing attacks on our email systems, other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, wire fraud or other cyber incidents.\nAlthough we work closely with industry recognized manufacturers supporting the security measures we have employed in an effort to keep our technology current with the ongoing threats, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive, and therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of employee, customer or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impact on our future sales. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection or data restoration measures could be significant.\nFinancial, Credit, and Liquidity Risks\nDue to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.\nThe technology within our products evolves, and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amount of inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nAssets have become, and may become further, impaired, requiring us to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe review our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a one-time $4.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge arising from prior acquisitions, and we may be required to record impairment charges on other assets in the future.\nWe may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.\nWe may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in our profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those in the U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law is enacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company has evaluated and recorded the aggregate impact of this passed legislation on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Any benefits associated with lower U.S. corporate tax rates could be reduced or outweighed by other tax changes adverse to our business or operations, such as new or additional taxes imposed on earnings and/or reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of such legislation, including adverse future regulatory guidance, could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.\nOther changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nAn increase in the LIBOR rate or a phase-out or replacement of LIBOR with a benchmark rate that is higher or more volatile than the LIBOR rate could increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position.\nThe interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Further, in July 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The cessation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of LIBOR has since been extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration until mid-2023. In response to concerns regarding the future of LIBOR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) to identify alternatives to LIBOR. The ARRC has recommended a benchmark replacement procedures to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation. The initial steps in the ARRC\u2019s recommended provision reference variations of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). Additionally, it is uncertain if applicable tenors of LIBOR will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement. Additionally, it is uncertain if applicable tenors of LIBOR will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. At this time, all of our debt obligations that are based on LIBOR will mature at the end of 2021, but in anticipation of LIBOR\u2019s phase out, the Second Amendment to our [2018 Credit Agreement] provides for alternative benchmark rates (including a hard-wired SOFR-based alternative benchmark) as well as transition mechanisms for selecting another benchmark replacement rate for LIBOR, with such benchmark replacement rate to be mutually agreed with the lender. We will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur. Accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 42922, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "HURC"}
