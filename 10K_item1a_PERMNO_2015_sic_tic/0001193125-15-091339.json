Risk Factors\nThe following important factors, among others, could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be materially adversely affected. This section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 3.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred net losses in prior periods.\nAlthough we were profitable in 2014 and 2012, we incurred losses in 2013, 2011 and 2010. If we are unable to maintain profitability, the market value of our stock may decline, and an investor could lose all or a part of their investment.\nIf there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products could decline, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nThe aesthetic laser and light-based treatment system industry in which we operate is particularly vulnerable to economic trends. Most procedures performed using our aesthetic treatment systems are elective procedures that are not reimbursable through government or private health insurance. The cost of these elective procedures must be borne by the patient. As a result, the decision to undergo a procedure that utilizes our products may be influenced by the cost.\nConsumer demand, and therefore our business, is sensitive to a number of factors that affect consumer spending, including political and macroeconomic conditions, health of credit markets, disposable consumer income levels, consumer debt levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and other factors. For example, consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, and practitioner demand for our products, decreased dramatically during 2009 as a result of turmoil in the financial markets, which contributed to a significant decrease in our total product revenues during that year. If there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products would decline, and our business would suffer.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past or which we expect for the future. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below our expectations or the expectations of market analysts or investors. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and the following factors, may adversely affect our financial results:\n\u2022\nour inability to introduce new products to the market in a timely fashion, or at all;\n\u2022\nour inability to quickly address and resolve reliability issues in our products and/or meet warranty and service obligations to our customers;\n\u2022\ncontinued availability of attractive equipment leasing terms for our customers, which may be negatively influenced by interest rate increases or lack of available credit;\n\u2022\nincreases in the length of our sales cycle; and\n\u2022\nreductions in the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\nIn addition, we may be subject to seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations, because our customers may be more likely to make equipment purchasing decisions near year-end, and because practitioners may be less likely to make purchasing decisions in the summer months.\nOur competitors may prevent us from achieving further market penetration or improving operating results.\nCompetition in the aesthetic device industry is intense. Our products compete against products offered by public companies, such as Cutera, Lumenis, Syneron Medical, and ZELTIQ Aesthetics, as well as several smaller specialized private companies, such as Alma Lasers (acquired in May 2013 by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Ltd.). Some of these competitors have greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations, as well as worldwide distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities that are larger and more established than ours. Additional competitors may enter the market, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.\nWe also face competition against non-light-based medical products, such as BOTOX\u00ae and collagen injections, and surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures, such as face lifts, chemical peels, abdominoplasty, liposuction, microdermabrasion, sclerotherapy and electrolysis. We may also face competition from manufacturers of pharmaceutical and other products that have not yet been developed. As a result of competition with these companies, products and procedures, we could experience loss of market share and decreasing revenue as well as reduced prices and profit margins, any of which would harm our business and operating results.\nAs a result of competition with our competitor companies, products and procedures, we could experience loss of market share and decreasing revenue as well as reduced prices and profit margins, any of which would harm our business and operating results.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and our products from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:\n\u2022\nproduct performance, reliability and design;\n\u2022\nability to sell products tailored to meet the applications needs of clients and patients;\n\u2022\nquality of customer support;\n\u2022\nproduct pricing;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\nsales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nsuccess and timing of new product development and introductions; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property protection.\nWe face exposure to credit risk of customers.\nIn the event of deterioration of general business conditions or the availability of credit, the financial strength and stability of our customers and potential customers may deteriorate over time, which may cause them to cancel or delay their purchase of our products. In addition, we may be subject to increased risk of non-payment of our accounts receivables. We may also be adversely affected by bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers and potential customers. A significant delay in the collection of funds or a reduction of funds collected may impact our liquidity or result in bad debts.\nIf we do not continue to develop and commercialize new products and identify new markets for our products and technology, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.\nThe aesthetic laser and light-based treatment system industry is subject to continuous technological development and product innovation. If we do not continue to innovate and develop new products and applications, our competitive position will likely deteriorate as other companies successfully design and commercialize new products and applications. Accordingly, our success depends in part on developing or acquiring new and innovative applications of laser and other light-based technology and identifying new markets for and applications of existing products and technology. If we are unable to develop and commercialize new products, identify and acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies, and identify new markets for our products and technology, our product and technology offerings could become obsolete and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nTo remain competitive, we must:\n\u2022\ndevelop or acquire new technologies that either add to or significantly improve our current products;\n\u2022\nconvince our target practitioner customers that our new products or product upgrades would be attractive revenue-generating additions to their practices;\n\u2022\nsell our products to non-traditional customers, including primary care physicians, gynecologists and other specialists;\n\u2022\nidentify new markets and emerging technological trends in our target markets and react effectively to technological changes;\n\u2022\npreserve goodwill and brand value with customers; and\n\u2022\nmaintain effective sales and marketing strategies.\nIf our new products do not gain market acceptance, our revenues and operating results could suffer, and our newer generation product sales could cause earlier generation product sales to suffer.\nThe commercial success of the products and technology we develop will depend upon the acceptance of these products by providers of aesthetic procedures and their patients and clients, and in the case of our home-use system, consumers. It is difficult for us to predict how successful recently introduced products, or products we are currently developing, will be over the long term. If the products we develop do not gain market acceptance or meet customer expectations, our revenues and operating results could suffer.\nWe expect that many of the products we develop will be based upon new technologies or new applications of existing technologies. It may be difficult for us to achieve market acceptance of some of our products, particularly the first products that we introduce to the market based on new technologies or new applications of existing technologies.\nAs we introduce new technologies to the market, our earlier generation product sales could suffer, which may result in write-offs of those earlier generation products. For example, in 2009, we recorded a $2.1 million charge to cost of product revenues related to the write-down of an earlier generation product. The write-down resulted, in part, from customers adopting our newer generation products more quickly than we anticipated, coupled with the downturn in the overall aesthetic laser market.\nIf demand for our aesthetic treatment systems by physician customers does not increase, our revenues will suffer and our business will be harmed.\nWe market our aesthetic treatment systems to physicians and other practitioners. In addition, through our development agreement with Unilever, we began to address the home-use aesthetic laser market in the second half of 2014. We believe, and our growth expectations assume, that we and other companies selling lasers and\nother light-based aesthetic treatment systems have not fully penetrated these markets and that we will continue to receive a significant percentage of our revenues from selling to these markets. If our expectations as to the size of these markets and our ability to sell our products to participants in these markets are not correct, our revenues will suffer and our business will be harmed.\nWe sell our products and services through subsidiaries and distributors in numerous international markets. Our operating results may suffer if we are unable to manage our international operations effectively.\nWe sell our products and services through subsidiaries and distributors in approximately 120 foreign countries, and we therefore are subject to risks associated with having international operations. We derived 48%, 48%, and 49% of our product revenues from sales outside North America for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.\nOur international sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nforeign certification and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability.\nIf we are unsuccessful at managing these risks, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur foreign currency translation charges as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\nThe U.S. dollar is our functional currency. Although we sell our products and services through subsidiaries and distributors in approximately 120 foreign countries, approximately 47% of our revenues outside of North America for the year ended December 31, 2014, and 51% of our revenues outside of North America for the year ended December 31, 2013, were denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our remaining revenues and all of our operating costs outside of North America are recognized in euros, British pounds, Moroccan dirham, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, South Korean won and Australian dollars. We have not historically engaged in hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. dollar operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the currencies in which such revenues are realized or costs are incurred and the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not receive revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.\nInvestment in product development often involves a long payback cycle and risks associated with new technology. For example, our PicoSure laser system, which we launched in 2013, was in development for several years. We have made and expect to continue making significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not generate anticipated revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.\nBecause we do not require training for users of our non-invasive products, and we sell these products to non-physicians, there exists an increased potential for misuse of these products, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nFederal regulations allow us to sell our products to or on the order of practitioners licensed by law to use or order the use of a prescription device. The definition of \u201clicensed practitioners\u201d varies from state to state. As a\nresult, our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training and, in many states, by non-physicians, including nurse practitioners, chiropractors and technicians. Outside the United States, many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products. We do not supervise the procedures performed with our products, nor can we require that direct medical supervision occur. We and our distributors offer product training sessions, but neither we nor our distributors require purchasers or operators of our non-invasive products to attend training sessions. The lack of required training and the purchase and use of our non-invasive products by non-physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain management and other personnel we need to succeed.\nOur success depends on the services of our senior management and other key research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. We consider retaining Michael R. Davin, our chief executive officer, key to our efforts to develop, sell and market our products and remain competitive. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Davin; however, the employment agreement is terminable by him on short notice and may not ensure his continued service with our company. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to do so.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or technologies that could disrupt our ongoing business, divert the attention of our management and employees and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may, from time to time, evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of other complementary businesses, products or technologies, as well as consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on favorable terms or complete otherwise favorable acquisitions because of antitrust or other regulatory concerns. We cannot assure you that the acquisitions we have completed, including our September 2014 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Ellman, or any future acquisitions that we may make, will enhance our products or strengthen our competitive position. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the acquired businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, and in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses. The integration of these businesses may not result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration and these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time.\nOur stock price has fluctuated substantially, and we expect it will continue to do so.\nOur Class A common stock price has fluctuated substantially in recent years. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014, our Class A common stock has traded as high as $31.48 per share and as low as $11.64 per share. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our Class A common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, if the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective on October 26, 2012, which we refer to as the shelf registration statement, permits us and El.En. to offer and sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings, which could adversely affect our stock price. A decline in our stock price could result in the loss of all or a part of our stockholders\u2019 investments.\nOur common stock could be further diluted by the conversion of outstanding options and restricted stock units.\nIn the past, we have issued and still have outstanding convertible securities in the form of options and restricted stock units. We may continue to issue options, restricted stock units, and other equity rights as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees, directors and consultants or others who provide services to us. We have a substantial number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion and exercise of these securities. Such a conversion would dilute our stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to successfully collect licensing royalties.\nPortions of our revenues consist of royalties from sub-licensing patents, including patents licensed to us on an exclusive basis by MGH. These patents expired in the United States on February 1, 2015 and their foreign counterparts will expire in several foreign jurisdictions on January 31, 2016. If we are unable to collect our licensing royalties, our revenues will decline. In addition, though we receive royalty revenues on other patents, our revenues will decline as a result of the expiration of the MGH patents because we will no longer receive any royalties from such patents.\nWe face risks associated with product warranties.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of product failures for which we are responsible under warranty obligations.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our reputation, business and operating results may suffer.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, and invoicing and collection of payments for our products. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, are susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our reputation, business and operating results may suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf we fail to obtain key components of our products from our sole source or limited source suppliers or service providers, our ability to manufacture and sell our products would be impaired and our business could be materially harmed.\nWe depend on sole or limited suppliers of certain components and systems that are critical to the products that we manufacture and sell, and to which the significant majority of our revenues are attributable. We depend on a single contract manufacturer in the United States for the subassembly of certain products that we manufacture and sell, and for the manufacturing of certain products that we sell, and to which a significant portion of our revenues are attributable to these products. We depend on El.En. for the SLT II laser system that we integrate with our own proprietary software and delivery systems into our SmartLipo Triplex, Cellulaze systems and PrecisionTx. We also depend on El.En. for the MonaLisa Touch laser system (for further information regarding our distribution agreements with El.En. please see the discussion on page 15). We use Alexandrite rods to manufacture the lasers for our Elite and PicoSure products and Nd:YAG rods to manufacture the lasers for our RevLite / MedLite C6 products. We depend exclusively on Northrop Grumman SYNOPTICS to supply both the Alexandrite and Nd:YAG rods to us, and we are aware of no alternative supplier of Alexandrite rods meeting our quality standards. We use gaussian mirrors and polarizers to manufacture our RevLite / MedLite C6 product lines, for which we depend exclusively on Channel Islands Opto-Mechanical Engineering and JDS Uniphase Corporation, respectively. We offer our SmartCool treatment cooling systems for use with our laser aesthetic treatment systems, and we depend exclusively on Zimmer Elektromedizin GmbH to supply SmartCool systems to us. In addition, one third party supplier assembles and tests many of the components and subassemblies for our Elite, Cynergy, SmoothShapes XV and Accolade product families. We use diode laser subassemblies from IPG Photonics to manufacture our Aspire\u00ae body sculpting system with SlimLipo handpiece, and we use diode laser bars from Coherent to manufacture our Vectus Laser. Although alternative suppliers exist for the diode laser subassemblies and diode laser bars, they could take months to qualify and implement.\nOther than with El.En., we do not have long-term arrangements with any of our suppliers or our contract manufacturer for the supply of these components or systems or with the assembly and test service provider referenced above, but instead purchase from them on a purchase order basis. Northrop Grumman SYNOPTICS, Channel Islands Opto-Mechanical Engineering, JDS Uniphase, Zimmer Elektromedizin, IPG Photonics and Coherent are not required, and may not be able or willing, to meet our future requirements at current prices, or at all.\nUnder our agreements with El.En. and our purchase order arrangements with our other suppliers and service providers, we are vulnerable to supply shortages and cessations and price fluctuations with respect to these critical components and systems and services. Such shortages or cessations could occur either as a result of breach by El.En. or us of our distribution agreements, or as a result of other types of business decisions made by El.En. or other suppliers and service providers. Any extended interruption in our supplies of these components or systems or in the assembly and test services could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on third party distributors to market, sell and service a significant portion of our products. If these distributors do not commit the necessary resources to effectively market, sell and service our products or if our relationships with these distributors are disrupted, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nIn the United States, Canada, Mexico, France, Morocco, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Japan and Korea, we sell our products through our internal sales organization. Outside of these markets, we sell our products through third party distributors. Our home-use laser system for the treatment of wrinkles, which launched in the United States in the second quarter of 2014, is sold by Unilever. Our sales and marketing success in these other markets depends on these distributors, in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace. Sales of our aesthetic treatment systems by third party distributors represented 21%, 25% and 25% of our product revenue in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.\nWe do not control our distributors or Unilever, and these parties may not be successful in marketing our products. These parties may fail to commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. Currently, we have written distributor agreements in place with most of our third party distributors and a distribution and licensing agreement in place with Unilever. We cannot be sure that our distributors or Unilever will agree with our interpretation of the terms of the agreements or that we will receive payments under the agreements. The third party distributors with which we do not have written distributor agreements may also disagree with the terms of our relationship. Our distributors and Unilever may terminate their relationships with us and stop selling and servicing our products with little or no notice. If current or future third party distributors or other parties that sell our products do not perform adequately, or if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with these parties or fail to recruit and retain distributors in particular geographic areas, our revenue from international sales may be adversely affected and our operating results could suffer. If Unilever fails to successfully sell the home-use product or we fail to maintain our relationship with Unilever, this could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with El.En. and Our Corporate Structure\nEl.En. and its subsidiaries market and sell products that compete with our products, and any increased competition from El.En. could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEl.En. is a leading laser manufacturer in Europe and a leading light-based medical device manufacturer worldwide. El.En. and its subsidiaries develop and produce laser systems with scientific, industrial, commercial and medical applications. Under exclusive distribution agreements with El.En., we purchase from El.En. its proprietary SmartLipo MPX system and its SLT II laser system. The SLT II laser system is an essential component of our SmartLipo Triplex and Cellulaze systems, which also incorporate our proprietary software and delivery systems. We also depend on El.En. for the MonaLisa Touch laser system (for further information regarding our distribution agreements with El.En. please see the discussion on page 15).\nEl.En. markets, sells, promotes and licenses other products that compete with our products, both in North America and elsewhere throughout the world, and our agreements with El.En. do not prevent El.En. from competing with us by selling products that we purchased in the past from El.En., including earlier generation SmartLipo systems. In the event that the applicable agreement terminates, El.En. would be able to compete with us worldwide with the SmartLipo MPX system, with products containing the SLT II laser system and with the MonaLisa Touch product line. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by increased competition from El.En.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of the members of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of our directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation. In addition, absent approval of our board of directors, our bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Section 203 may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both, as we did in a 2006 patent license agreement with Palomar. Such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in our industry. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other types of patent litigation and other proceedings, including reexamination proceedings, inter partes or post-grant review or interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights relating to our technology and products, the commercial value of our technology and products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to obtain protection in the United States and other countries for our products by establishing and maintaining intellectual property rights relating to or incorporated into our technology and products. We own numerous patents and patent applications in the United States and corresponding patents and patent applications in many foreign jurisdictions. We do not know how successful we would be in any instance in which we asserted our patents against suspected infringers. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that would be advantageous to us. Even if issued, our patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented,\nwhich could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain necessary FDA clearances for our products and indications or if clearances for future products and indications are delayed or not issued, our business would be harmed.\nOur products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities. These regulations relate to manufacturing, labeling, sale, promotion, distribution, importing and exporting and shipping of our products. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, an existing product, we must first receive either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Both of these processes can be expensive and lengthy and entail significant user fees, unless exempt. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process often takes from three to 12 months. The FDA may require us to withdraw an application if they cannot make a determination that the device is substantially equivalent according to the regulations. In such situations, we may re-submit the 510(k) application with additional data for reconsideration or we may determine not to commercialize the device or the new indication for use. The process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. It generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the premarket approval application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained.\nIn order to obtain premarket approval and, in some cases, a 510(k) clearance, a product sponsor must conduct well controlled clinical trials designed to test the safety and effectiveness of the product. Conducting clinical trials generally entails a long, expensive and uncertain process that is subject to delays and failure at any stage. The data obtained from clinical trials may be inadequate to support approval or clearance of a submission. In addition, the occurrence of unexpected findings in connection with clinical trials may prevent or delay obtaining approval or clearance. If we conduct clinical trials, they may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval or clearance, for numerous reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe FDA, other regulatory authorities or an institutional review board may place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022\npatients may not enroll in clinical trials, or patient follow-up may not occur, at the rate we expect;\n\u2022\npatients may not comply with trial protocols;\n\u2022\ninstitutional review boards and third party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocol;\n\u2022\nthird party clinical investigators may decline to participate in a trial or may not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices, or other FDA requirements;\n\u2022\nthird party organizations may not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nregulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials, or invalidate our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions; and\n\u2022\nthe interim or final results of the clinical trials may be inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness.\nMedical devices may be marketed only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. The FDA may not approve or clear indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products. Our clearances can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop.\nAfter clearance or approval of our products, we are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, and if we fail to comply with FDA regulations, our business could suffer.\nEven after clearance or approval of a product, we are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including the requirements that our facility be registered and our devices listed with the agency. We are subject to Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We must report corrections and removals to the FDA where the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health, and maintain records of other corrections or removals. The FDA closely regulates promotion and advertising and our promotional and advertising activities could come under scrutiny. If the FDA objects to our promotional and advertising activities or finds that we failed to submit reports under the Medical Device Reporting regulations, for example, the FDA may allege our activities resulted in violations.\nThe FDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrepair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or new intended uses;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nIf any of these events were to occur, they could harm our business.\nFederal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a device. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. For example, the FDA had proposed changing its standards for determining when a medical device modification must receive premarket clearance or approval. Although Congress objected to these revised standards, it is possible that the FDA will seek to implement these or similar changes in the future.\nIn addition, most of the products and systems that we sell became subject in 2013 to a new excise tax on sales of certain medical devices in the United States after December 31, 2012 by the manufacturer, producer or\nimporter in an amount equal to 2.3% of the sale price. Under the law, additional charges, including warranties, may be deemed to be included in the sale price for purposes of determining the amount of the excise tax. We believe this excise tax could harm our sales and reduce our profitability.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes reporting and disclosure requirements, commonly referred to as the \u201cSunshine Act\u201d, for manufacturers of drugs, biological, medical devices and medical supplies with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain physicians and teaching hospitals. The final rules implementing the Sunshine Act are complex, ambiguous, and broad in scope. Sales related to the Ellman surgical product line are subject to the reporting requirements under the Sunshine Act. We believe that sales related to our aesthetic product lines fall under a reporting exception under this law and, accordingly, reporting related to those sales is not required.\nOur compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements is, and will continue to be, costly and time consuming. It is impossible to predict whether other legislative changes will be enacted or government regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. If we are found to be in violation of any of this or any other law, we may be subject to penalties, including fines.\nWe have modified some of our products without FDA clearance. The FDA could retroactively determine that the modifications were improper and require us to stop marketing and recall the modified products.\nAny modifications to one of our FDA-cleared devices that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or a premarket approval. We may be required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data depending on the nature of the changes. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our revenue and operating results. We have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign, among other things, our products.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation and laser performance standards, our manufacturing operations could be halted, and our business would suffer.\nWe are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality Systems Regulation. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. Because our products involve the use of lasers, our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in FDA regulations. The laser performance standard imposes specific record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements. These requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products. The FDA enforces the QSR and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections. We have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections. Our failure to comply with the QSR or to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection or our failure to comply with applicable laser performance standards could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of or restrictions on our manufacturing operations, delays in approving or clearing a product, refusal to permit the import or export of our products, a recall or seizure of our products, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, such as those described in the preceding paragraphs, any of which could cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nIf we fail to comply with state laws and regulations, or if state laws or regulations change, our business could suffer.\nIn addition to FDA regulations, most of our products are also subject to state regulations relating to their sale and use. These regulations are complex and vary from state to state, which complicates monitoring compliance. In addition, these regulations are in many instances in flux. For example, federal regulations allow our prescription products to be sold to or on the order of \u201clicensed practitioners,\u201d that is, practitioners licensed by law to use or order the use of a prescription device. Licensed practitioners are defined on a state-by-state basis. As a result, some states permit non-physicians to purchase and operate our products, while other states do not. Additionally, a state could change its regulations at any time to prohibit sales to particular types of customers. We believe that, to date, we have sold our prescription products only to licensed practitioners. However, our failure to comply with state laws or regulations and changes in state laws or regulations may adversely affect our business.\nWe, or our distributors, may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory qualifications or approvals for our current or future products and indications, which could harm our business.\nSales of our products outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In many countries, our third party distributors are responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for our products. We do not control our third party distributors, and they may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining these regulatory approvals. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the United States.\nComplying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time consuming process, and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain foreign clearances or approvals may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may differ significantly from FDA requirements. Foreign regulatory authorities may not clear or approve our products for the same indications cleared or approved by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval in addition to other risks. Although we or our distributors have obtained regulatory approvals in the European Union and other countries outside the United States for many of our products, we or our distributors may be unable to maintain regulatory qualifications, clearances or approvals in these countries or obtain qualifications, clearances or approvals in other countries. If we are not successful in doing so, our business will be harmed. We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory clearances, approvals or qualifications. Foreign regulatory agencies, as well as the FDA, periodically inspect manufacturing facilities both in the United States and abroad. If we experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our products outside the United States, or if we fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, or if we fail to comply with other foreign regulatory requirements, we and our distributors may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all. Additionally, the imposition of new requirements may significantly affect our business and our products. We may not be able to adjust to such new requirements.\nRisks Related to Litigation\nProduct liability and business liability suits could be brought against us due to defective design, material or workmanship or due to misuse of our products. These lawsuits could be expensive and time consuming and result in substantial damages to us and increases in our insurance rates.\nIf our products are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our customers or their patients or clients. Misusing our products or failing to adhere to operating guidelines for our products can cause severe burns or other significant damage to the eyes, skin or other tissue. If our products fail to function properly, we may be required to conduct product recalls and our customers may lose the ability to treat their patients or clients\nresulting in a loss of business for our customers. We are routinely involved in claims related to the use of our products. Product liability and business liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. Our current insurance coverage may not apply or may not be sufficient to cover these claims, and the coverage we have is subject to deductibles for which we are responsible. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance in amount or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Any product liability or other claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and reduce product sales. We would need to pay any losses in excess of our insurance coverage out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our operating results.\nWe may incur substantial expenses if our past practices are shown to have violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\nWe previously used facsimiles to disseminate information about our clinical workshops to large numbers of customers and potential customers. These facsimiles were transmitted by third parties retained by us, and were sent to recipients whose facsimile numbers were supplied by us as well as other recipients whose facsimile numbers we purchased from other sources. In May 2005, we stopped sending unsolicited facsimiles to customers and potential customers.\nUnder the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, recipients of unsolicited facsimile \u201cadvertisements\u201d may be entitled to damages of up to $500 per facsimile for inadvertent violations and up to $1,500 per facsimile for knowing or willful violations. Recipients of unsolicited facsimile advertisements may seek enforcement of the TCPA in state courts. The TCPA also permits states to initiate a civil action in a federal district court to enforce the TCPA against a party who engages in a pattern or practice of violations of the TCPA. In addition, complaints may be filed with the Federal Communications Commission, which has the power to assess penalties against parties for violations of the TCPA.\nIn 2005, a plaintiff, individually and as putative representative of a purported class, filed a complaint against us under the TCPA in Massachusetts Superior Court in Middlesex County seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The complaint alleged that we violated the TCPA by sending unsolicited advertisements by facsimile to the plaintiff and other recipients without the prior express invitation or permission of the recipients. Based on discovery in this matter, the plaintiff alleges that approximately three million facsimiles were sent on our behalf by a third party to approximately 100,000 individuals. In January 2012, the court denied the class certification motion. In November 2012, the court issued the final judgment and awarded the plaintiff $6,000 in damages and awarded us $3,495 in costs. The plaintiff appealed this decision and oral argument on the appeal was heard in October 2013 before the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Appeals Court. In March 2014, the appeals court affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and in April 2014 plaintiff filed a request for further appellate review by the Supreme Judicial Court. On May 6, 2014, the Supreme Judicial Court issued a Notice of Denial of Application for Further Appellate Review. No further appeals are possible in Massachusetts. In addition, in July 2012, the plaintiff filed a new purported class action, based on the same operative facts and asserting the same claims as in the Massachusetts action, in federal court in the Eastern District of New York. In February 2013 that court granted our motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s claims. In March 2013, the plaintiff drafted a motion seeking reconsideration of the court\u2019s judgment and vacation of the court\u2019s order of dismissal. In April 2013, we drafted a response opposing the plaintiff\u2019s motion. On August 14, 2013, plaintiff filed its motion with the court, although the deadline had been April 26, 2013. We filed a letter with the court objecting to this untimely motion and requesting sanctions. On February 6, 2014, the court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion and denied our request for sanctions. On March 6, 2014, plaintiff filed an appeal of the court\u2019s judgment entered on March 5, 2013. On July 23, 2014, the Second Circuit notified the parties that it will not hear oral arguments and will decide the case based on the briefs.\nWe are vigorously defending these lawsuits. However, litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this or any other matter. Moreover, the amount of any potential\nliability in connection with this lawsuit will depend, to a large extent, on whether a class in a class action lawsuit is certified and, if one is certified, on the scope of the class, neither of which we can predict at this time.\nThese and any future lawsuits that we may face regarding these issues could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nEmployment related lawsuits could be brought against us for improper termination of employment, sexual harassment, hostile work environment and other claims. These lawsuits could be expensive and time consuming and result in substantial damages to us and increases in our insurance rates.\nIf we terminate employment for improper reasons or fail to provide an appropriate work environment or it is alleged that we did so, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our former and current employees. We are routinely involved in claims related to improper termination and other claims. Such claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. Our current insurance coverage may not apply or may not be sufficient to cover these claims, and the coverage we have is subject to deductibles for which we are responsible. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance in amount or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Any employment related claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our employment law insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and reduce product sales. We would need to pay any losses in excess of our insurance coverage out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our operating results.", "PERMNO": 91020, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CYNO"}
