Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Report, including our financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to the Investment Industry\nOur results of operations depend upon the market value and composition of assets under management, which can fluctuate significantly based on various factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur revenues are primarily generated from fees derived as a percentage of assets under management (\u201cAUM\u201d). The value of our AUM can be negatively impacted by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nMarket performance: Performance of the securities markets could be impacted by a number of factors beyond our control, including, among others, general economic downturns, political uncertainty or acts of terrorism. Negative performance within the securities markets or short-term volatility within the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing assets, decreasing their rates of investment or shifting assets to cash or other asset classes or strategies that we do not manage, all of which could reduce our revenues. In addition, during periods of slowing growth or declining revenues, profits and profit margins are adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed.\n\u2022\nInvestment performance: Because we compete with many asset management firms on the basis of our investment strategies, the maintenance and growth of assets under management is dependent, to a significant extent, on the investment performance of the assets that we manage. Poor performance tends to result in the loss or reduction of client accounts, which decreases revenues. Underperformance relative to peer groups for our various investment strategies could adversely affect our results of operations, especially if such underperformance continues for an extended period of time. The historical returns of our strategies and the ratings and rankings we, or the mutual funds that we advise, have received in the past should not be considered indicative of the future results of these strategies or of any other strategies that we may develop in the future. The investment performance we achieve for our customers varies over time and variances can be wide. In addition, certain of our investment strategies have capacity constraints, as there is a limit to the number of securities available for certain strategies to operate effectively. In those instances, we may choose to limit access to new or existing investors.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation with attendant compliance costs and serious consequences for violations; expansion into international markets and introduction of new products and services increases our regulatory and operational risks.\nVirtually all aspects of our business are subject to laws and regulations, including the Investment Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act, the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Finance Code and anti-money laundering laws. These laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from operating our business, as well as powers to place us under conservatorship or closure if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Violations of such laws or regulations could subject us or our employees to disciplinary proceedings and civil or criminal liability, including revocation of licenses, censures, fines or temporary suspensions, permanent barring from the conduct of business, conservatorship, or closure. Any such proceeding or liability could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. In recent years, regulators have increased their oversight of the financial services industry. Some regulations are focused directly on the investment management industry, while others are more broadly focused but affect our industry as well. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 significantly increased and revised the federal rules and regulations governing the financial services industry and, in addition to other regulations, has generally resulted in increased compliance and administrative requirements. For example, the SEC\u2019s adoption of Form PF and revisions to Form ADV impose additional reporting requirements for SEC-registered investment advisors. Additionally, ERISA Section 408(b)(2) and related regulations require additional information to be provided to ERISA-governed retirement plans. While we believe that changes in laws, rules and regulations, including those discussed above, have increased our administrative and compliance costs, we are unable to quantify the increased costs attributable to such changes. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation.\u201d\nRecently, we have expanded our product offerings, vehicles offered and international business activities with strategies in global and emerging markets, global multi-asset and global convertible securities. Additionally, our client base continues to expand internationally. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 18% of our AUM is managed for clients who are domiciled outside the United States. As a result, we face increased operational, regulatory, compliance, reputation and foreign exchange rate risks. In particular, rapid regulatory change is occurring internationally with respect to financial institutions, including, but not limited to, anticipated revisions to the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011. The failure of our compliance and internal control systems to properly identify and mitigate such additional risks, or of our operating infrastructure to support international activities, could result in operational failures and actions by regulatory agencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe devote considerable time and resources to both domestic and international compliance; however, we may fail to timely and properly identify regulatory requirements or modify our compliance procedures for changes in our regulatory environment, which may subject us to legal proceedings, domestic and foreign government investigations, penalties and fines.\nThe investment management and private wealth industry is highly competitive and innovative.\nThe investment management and private wealth industry is highly competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, fee rates, continuity of investment professionals and client relationships, the quality of services provided to clients, corporate positioning and business reputation and differentiated products. A number of factors increase our competitive risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nPotential competitors have a relatively low cost of entering the investment management industry.\n\u2022\nMany competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, more comprehensive name recognition and more personnel than we do.\n\u2022\nThe recent trend toward consolidation in the investment management industry, and the securities business in general, has served to increase the size and strength of some of our competitors.\n\u2022\nThe enhanced ability for firms offering passive management to effectively compete with us.\n\u2022\nSome competitors may invest in different investment styles or alternative asset classes that may be perceived as more attractive than our investment strategies.\n\u2022\nOther industry participants, hedge funds and alternative asset managers may seek to recruit our investment professionals.\n\u2022\nSome competitors charge lower fees for their investment management services than we do.\n\u2022\nSome competitors may provide additional client services, including banking, financial planning and tax planning.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our earnings could be reduced and our business could be adversely affected.\nWestwood invests in the securities of non-U.S. companies, which involve foreign currency exchange, tax, political, social and economic uncertainties and risks.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 16% of our assets under management were invested in strategies offering access to global and emerging markets with significant exposure to non-U.S. companies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the returns of clients invested in these strategies. Investments in non-U.S. issuers may also be affected by tax positions taken in countries or regions in which we are invested as well as political, social and economic uncertainty, including, for example, the broad decline in global economic conditions that began in 2015. Many financial markets are less developed or efficient than U.S. financial markets and therefore may have limited liquidity and higher price volatility, and may lack an established regulatory framework. Liquidity may be adversely affected by political or economic events, government policies, and social or civil unrest within a particular country. These risks, among others, could adversely affect the performance of our strategies invested in securities of non-U.S. issuers and may be particularly acute in the emerging or less developed markets in which we invest. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain client investments in these strategies or assets invested in these strategies may experience significant declines in value, and our results of operations may be negatively affected.\nDue to the substantial cost and time required to introduce new investment strategies, we may not be able to successfully introduce new investment strategies in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe have incurred significant costs to develop new investment strategies, launch new mutual funds under the Westwood Funds\u00ae name, launch UCITS funds and upgrade our business infrastructure. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to such improvements.\nThe development of new investment strategies, whether through acquisition or internal development, requires a substantial amount of time and significant financial resources, including expenses related to compensation, sales and marketing, information technology, legal counsel and other professional services. Our ability to market and sell a new investment strategy depends on our financial resources, the investment performance of the specific strategy, the timing of the offering and our marketing strategies. Once an investment strategy is developed, we must effectively introduce the strategy to existing and prospective clients. Our ability to sell new investment strategies to existing and prospective clients depends on our ability to meet or exceed the performance of our competitors offering the same or a similar strategy. We may not be able to manage the assets within a given investment strategy profitably, and it may take years before we produce the level of results that will attract clients. If we are unable to realize the benefits of the costs and expenses incurred in developing new investment strategies, we may experience losses as a result of our management of these investment strategies, and our ability to introduce further new investment strategies and compete in our industry may be hampered.\nTo introduce new investment strategies, we may also seek to add new investment teams. To the extent we are unable to recruit and retain investment teams that will complement our existing business model, we may not be successful in further diversifying and increasing our investment strategies and client assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects. The addition of a new team using an investment strategy with which we may have limited or no experience could strain our operational resources and increase the possibility of operational error. If any such new teams or strategies perform poorly and fail to attract sufficient assets, our results of operations and reputation will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Business\nAcquisitions involve inherent risks that could compromise the success of the combined business and dilute the holdings of current stockholders.\nAs part of our long-term business strategy, we may pursue corporate development transactions including the acquisition of asset management firms, mutual funds, private wealth firms, investment professionals or teams. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Growth Strategy.\u201d If we are incorrect when assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability of such transactions, or if we fail to adequately integrate the acquired businesses or individuals, the success of the combined business could be compromised. Business acquisitions are subject to the risks commonly associated with such transactions including, among others, potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and to acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, potential disruptions to the business of the combined company and potential diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, the impairment of relationships with and the possible loss of key employees and clients as a result of changes in management, potential litigation or other legal risks, potential write-downs related to goodwill impairments in connection with acquisitions, and dilution to the stockholders of the combined company if the acquisition is made for stock of the combined company. In addition, investment strategies, technologies or businesses of acquired companies may not be effectively assimilated into our business or may have a negative effect on the combined company\u2019s revenues or earnings. The combined company may also incur significant expenses to complete acquisitions and support acquired investment strategies and businesses. Further, any such acquisitions may be funded with cash, debt or equity, which could dilute the holdings or limit the rights of stockholders. Finally, we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms.\nThe Woodway acquisition is subject to risks and uncertainties, including the successful integration of Woodway's business and personnel. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Woodway acquisition.\nOn April 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Woodway via the merger of Woodway into our wholly-owned subsidiary, Westwood Trust. The acquisition may not yield the forecasted benefits due to a variety of factors. Woodway may have unanticipated liabilities, for which we cannot be fully indemnified under the Merger Agreement. We may not be able to maintain or increase the levels of revenue, earnings and operating efficiency, or the client relationships, that Woodway achieved prior to the acquisition. The success of the Woodway acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits from continuing to integrate Woodway\u2019s business with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. If we experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs with the integration process or if the Woodway business deteriorates, the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the Woodway acquisition may not be realized fully, or realized at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, because we are issuing shares of Westwood common stock as consideration in the acquisition, the transaction will have the effect of diluting the holdings of our existing stockholders.\nIf any of the above risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted, and our stock price may decline as a result. For further information on our acquisition of Woodway, see Note 5 \u201cAcquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur business involves risks of being engaged in litigation and liability that could increase our expenses and reduce our results of operations.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability. We could be named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits or could be involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits seeking substantial damages. As an SEC-registered adviser, mutual fund adviser and publicly traded entity, we are subject to governmental and self-regulatory organization examinations, investigations and proceedings. Similarly, the investment strategies that we manage could be subject to actual or threatened lawsuits and governmental and self-regulatory organization investigations and proceedings, any of which could harm the investment returns or reputation of the applicable fund or result in our being liable for any resulting damages. There has been an increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the asset management industry in recent years, including customer claims, as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages. While customers do not have legal recourse against us solely on the basis of poor investment results, if our investment strategies perform poorly, we are more likely to become subject to litigation brought by dissatisfied clients. In addition, to the extent customers are successful in claiming that their losses resulted from fraud, negligence, willful misconduct, breach of contract or other similar misconduct, these clients may have remedies against us, the mutual funds and other funds we advise or our investment professionals under the federal securities laws or state law. See the discussion of our current legal proceedings in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d.\nMisuse of assets and information in the possession of our employees could damage our reputation and result in costly litigation and liability for our clients and us.\nOur employees handle significant amounts of assets along with financial and personal information for our clients. Our employees could misuse or improperly disclose such information, which could harm our reputation. We have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent use of assets and information; however, our controls may be insufficient to prevent fraudulent actions by employees. If our controls are ineffective, we could be subject to costly litigation, which could consume financial resources, distract management, damage our reputation and result in regulatory sanctions. Such fraudulent actions could also adversely affect clients, causing them to seek redress.\nOur success depends on certain key employees and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees could compromise our future success.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain professional and executive employees, including investment, marketing, client service and management personnel. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel within the asset management business, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Only a limited number of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer and certain investment employees, have employment contracts. Certain key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment at any time. In order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, investment and sales professionals often maintain strong relationships with their clients, and their departure may cause us to lose client accounts, which could have a material impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur brand is a valuable intangible asset that could be vulnerable to threats that can be difficult or impossible to anticipate or control. Regulatory inquiries and rumors could damage our reputation, even if they are unfounded or satisfactorily addressed. Damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key employees, and could reduce our assets under management, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFailure to properly address conflicts of interest could harm our reputation or cause clients to withdraw funds, each of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest, and we have implemented procedures and controls that we believe are reasonably designed to address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest, we could face reputational damage, litigation or regulatory proceedings, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, as we expand the scope of our business and our client base, we must continue to monitor and address any potential new conflicts between the interests of our stockholders and those of our clients. Our clients may withdraw funds if they perceive conflicts of interest between the investment decisions we make for strategies in which they have invested and our obligations to our stockholders. For example, we may limit the growth of assets in or close strategies or otherwise take action to slow the flow of assets when we believe it is in the best interest of our clients, even though our assets under management and investment management fees may be negatively impacted. Similarly, we may establish or add new investment teams or expand operations into other geographic areas or jurisdictions if we believe such actions are in the best interest of our clients, even though our results of operations may be adversely affected in the short term. Although we believe such actions enable us to retain client assets and maintain our profit margins, if clients perceive a change in our investment or operational decisions favors a strategy to maximize short term results, they may withdraw funds, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur business is vulnerable to systems failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny delays or inaccuracies in securities pricing information or information processing could give rise to claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are highly dependent on communications and information systems and on third-party vendors for securities pricing information and updates from certain software. We may suffer a systems failure or interruption, whether caused by an earthquake, fire, other natural disaster, power or telecommunications failure, unauthorized access, act of God, act of war, or otherwise, and our back-up procedures and capabilities may be inadequate to eliminate the risk of extended interruptions in operations.\nFailure to implement and maintain effective cyber security controls could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price.\nOur business is dependent on information technology systems and the cyber security controls we have in place to protect those systems and the information contained therein. A failure of our controls to protect our information technology from an external or internal attack or to prevent a breach of confidential client or competitive information could materially interrupt our operations and expose us to regulatory and legal actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, reputation and stock price.\nInsurance coverage may be inadequate or not cover legal and regulatory proceedings.\nWe maintain insurance coverage in amounts and on terms we believe appropriate to cover legal and regulatory matters; however, we can make no assurance that there will be adequate coverage or that a claim will be covered by our insurance policies at all. Additionally, insurance premiums may rise for substantially the same coverage amounts and terms, which will increase our expenses and reduce our net income.\nVarious factors may hinder the declaration and payment of dividends.\nWe have historically paid a quarterly dividend. However, payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and various factors may prevent us from paying dividends. Such factors include our financial position, capital requirements and liquidity, stock repurchase plans, state corporate and banking law restrictions, results of operations and such other factors as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. In addition, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the dividends and income we receive from our subsidiaries. Currently, our primary source of cash consists of dividends from Westwood Management or Westwood Trust. The payment of dividends by Westwood Trust is subject to the discretion of its Board of Directors and compliance with applicable laws, including, in particular, the provisions of the Finance Code applicable to Westwood Trust. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe may not be able to fund future capital requirements on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe cannot be certain that financing to fund our working capital or other cash requirements, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Our capital requirements may vary greatly from quarter to quarter depending on, among other things, capital expenditures, fluctuations in our operating results and financing activities. If future financing becomes necessary, we may or may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all. Further, any future equity financings could dilute the relative percentage ownership of then existing common stockholders and any future debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our brand and operating results could be harmed. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and even systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nWe cannot be certain that the measures we take to evaluate and improve our internal controls will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nOur stock is thinly traded and may be subject to volatility.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, it may remain relatively illiquid, or \u201cthinly traded,\u201d which can increase share price volatility and make it difficult for larger investors to buy or sell shares in the public market without affecting the quoted share price. Investors may be unable to buy or sell a certain quantity of our shares in the public market within one or more trading days. If limited trading in our stock continues, it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices.\nThe prevailing market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including (among other factors): actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results; changes in market valuations of other similarly situated companies; additions or departures of key personnel; future sales of common stock; deviations in net revenues or in losses from levels expected by the investment community; and trading volume fluctuations.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may prevent or deter another group from paying a premium over the market price to our stockholders to acquire our stock.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that require a vote of two-thirds of the shares of stock entitled to vote to remove directors for cause, establish that stockholders cannot act by written consent, and that authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without shareholder approval, blank check preferred stock. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to business combinations. These provisions could delay, deter or prevent a merger, consolidation, tender offer or other business combination or change of control involving us that could include a premium over the market price of our common stock that some or a majority of our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nWe are a holding company dependent on the operations and funds of our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company, with no revenue-generating operations and no assets other than our ownership interests in Westwood Management, Westwood Trust and Westwood International. Accordingly, we are dependent on the cash flow generated by these operating subsidiaries and rely on dividends or other intercompany transfers from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations.\nRisks Related to our Clients\nCompetitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins.\nTo the extent we have to compete on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure. Although our investment management fees vary from product to product, we have competed primarily on the performance of our products and client service rather than on the level of our investment management fees relative to our competitors. In recent years there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. In order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service levels that make investors willing to pay our fees. We cannot be assured that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service levels that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have performance fee agreements with a few clients, which pay us a fee if we outperform a specified index over predetermined periods of time. We may not be able to outperform such indexes, and failure to do so would cause us to earn none or only part of those potential revenues, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Our revenues from performance-based fees could fluctuate significantly from one measurement period to the next, depending on how we perform relative to the indexes specified in these agreements. For example, we earned performance fees of $2.7 million in 2015, $3.8 million in 2014 and $2.6 million in 2013.\nOur business is dependent on investment advisory, subadvisory and trust agreements that are subject to termination or non-renewal. As a result, we could lose any of our clients on very short notice.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived pursuant to investment advisory, subadvisory and trust agreements with our clients. Investors in funds that we advise or subadvise may redeem their investments at any time without prior notice, thereby reducing our assets under management. These investors may redeem for any reason, including general financial market conditions, our absolute or relative investment performance, or their own financial condition and requirements. In a declining stock market, the pace of redemptions could accelerate. Redemption of a substantial amount of investments or a termination or failure to renew a material number of these agreements would adversely affect our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nA small number of clients account for a substantial portion of our business, and a reduction or loss of business with any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ten largest clients accounted for over 20% of fee revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our relationships with these clients. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining existing client relationships, securing additional clients or achieving the superior investment performance necessary to earn performance-based advisory fees. Our failure to retain one or more of these large clients or to establish profitable relationships with additional clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89443, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "WHG"}
