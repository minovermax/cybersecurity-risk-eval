{"cik": "66004", "company": "MIDDLESEX WATER CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.\nOperational Risks\nWeather conditions and overuse of underground aquifers may interfere with our sources of water, demand for water services and our ability to supply water to customers.\nOur ability to meet current and future water demands of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. Unexpected conditions may interfere with our water supply sources. Drought and overuse of underground aquifers may limit the availability of ground and/or surface water. Freezing weather may also contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by water main breakage. Any interruption in our water supply could cause a reduction in our revenue and profitability. These factors may adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers. Governmental drought restrictions may result in decreased customer demand for water services and can adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nIndex\nOur water sources or water service provided to customers may become contaminated by naturally-occurring or man-made compounds and events. This may cause disruption in services and impose operational and regulatory enforcement costs upon us to restore the water to required levels of quality as well as may damage our reputation and cause private litigation claims against us.\nOur sources of water or water in our distribution systems may become contaminated by naturally-occurring or man-made compounds or other events. In the event that any portion of our water supply sources or water distribution systems is contaminated, we may need to interrupt service to our customers until we are able to remediate the contamination or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source through existing interconnections with other water purveyors or through our transmission and distribution systems, where possible. We may also incur significant costs in treating any contaminated water, or remediating the effects on our treatment and distribution systems, through the use of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. Our inability to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water supply in a cost-effective manner, may reduce our revenues or increase our expenses and make us less profitable.\nWe may be unable to recover costs associated with treating water supplies through rates or, recovery of these costs may not occur in a timely manner. In addition, we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or legal actions arising out of interruption of service or perceived human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies. Such costs could adversely affect our financial results.\nContamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation, which are inherently subject to uncertainties and are potentially subject to unfavorable regulatory and/or legal actions. Negative impacts to our profitability and/or our reputation may occur even if we are not responsible for the contamination or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water supplies. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe necessity for ongoing physical and technological security has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased operating costs.\nBecause of physical and technological threats to the health and security of the United States of America, we employ procedures to review and modify security measures. We provide ongoing training and communications to our employees about threats to our water supply, our assets and related systems and our employees\u2019 personal safety. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs for security measures in efforts to protect against such risks.\nClimate variability may cause weather volatility in the future, which may impact water usage and related revenue or, may require additional expenditures to reduce risk associated with any increasing storm, flood, drought or other weather occurrences.\nIncreased climate variability may cause increased precipitation and flooding, increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events, potential degradation of water quality, decreases in available water supply, changes in water usage patterns and disruptions in service. Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our regulated businesses could be recovered through rates we charge to our customers, there can be no assurance that the NJBPU or the DEPSC would authorize recovery of such costs, in whole or in part.\nIndex\nRegulatory Risks\nOur revenue and earnings depend on the rates we charge our customers. We cannot raise utility rates in our regulated businesses without petitioning the appropriate Utility Commissions. If these agencies modify, delay or deny our petition, our revenues will not increase and our earnings will decline unless we are able to reduce costs without degrading service quality.\nThe NJBPU regulates our public utility companies in New Jersey with respect to rates and charges for service, classification of accounts, awards of new service territory, acquisitions, financings and other matters. That means, for example, that we cannot raise the utility rates we charge to our customers without first petitioning the NJBPU and navigating a lengthy administrative process. Similarly, the DEPSC regulates our public utility companies in Delaware. We cannot provide assurance as to when we will request approval for any such matter, nor can we predict whether these Utility Commissions will approve, deny or reduce the amount of such requests.\nCertain costs are not completely within our control. The failure to obtain any rate increase would prevent us from increasing our revenues and, unless we are able to reduce costs without degrading service quality, would result in reduced earnings.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including water quality and wastewater effluent quality regulations, as well as other state and local regulations. Compliance with those laws and regulations requires us to incur costs and we are subject to fines or other sanctions for non-compliance.\nGovernment environmental regulatory agencies regulate our operations in New Jersey and Delaware with respect to water supply, treatment and distribution systems and the quality of water. Government environmental regulatory agencies also regulate our operations in New Jersey and Delaware with respect to wastewater collection, treatment and disposal.\nGovernment environmental regulatory agencies\u2019 regulations relating to water quality require us to perform expanded types of testing to ensure our water meets state and federal water quality requirements. We are subject to USEPA regulations under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act and under the Federal Clean Water Act regarding wastewater services. Regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act include the Lead and Copper Rule, the maximum contaminant levels established for various volatile organic compounds, the Federal Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Total Coliform Rule. There are also similar NJDEP regulations for our New Jersey water systems. The NJDEP and DEDPH a monitor our activities and review the results of water quality tests we perform for adherence to applicable regulations. In addition, Government Environmental Regulatory Agencies are continually reviewing regulations governing the limits of certain organic compounds found in the water as byproducts of treatment.\nWe are also subject to regulations related to fire protection services in New Jersey and Delaware. In New Jersey there is no state-wide fire protection regulatory agency. However, New Jersey regulations exist as to the size of piping required regarding the provision of fire protection services. In Delaware, fire protection is regulated statewide by the Office of State Fire Marshal.\nThe cost of compliance with the water and wastewater effluent quality standards depends in part on the limits set in the regulations and on the methods selected to comply with these standards. If new or more restrictive standards are imposed, the cost of compliance could increase and therefore, have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations if we cannot recover those costs through the rates we charge our customers. The cost of compliance with fire protection requirements could also increase and make us less profitable if we cannot recover those costs through our rates charged to our customers.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with environmental or other laws and regulations to which our business is subject, we could be fined or subject to other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business or results of operations.\nIndex\nFinancial Risks\nWe depend upon our ability to raise money in the capital markets to finance some of the costs of complying with laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations or to pay for some of the costs of improvements to or the expansion of our utility system assets. Our regulated utility companies cannot issue debt or equity securities without prior regulatory approval.\nWe require financing from external sources to fund the ongoing capital program for the improvement in our utility system assets and for planned expansion of those systems. We expect to spend approximately $229 million for capital projects through 2024. We must obtain prior approval from our economic regulators to sell debt or equity securities to raise capital for these projects. If sufficient capital is not available, or the cost of capital is too high, or if the regulatory authorities deny our petition to sell debt or equity securities, we may not be able to meet the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations or the costs of improving and expanding our utility system assets to the level we believe operationally prudent. This may result in the imposition of fines from environmental regulators or restrictions on our operations which could curtail our ability to upgrade or replace utility system assets.\nWe face competition from other utilities and service providers which might hinder our growth opportunities and mitigate our future profitability.\nWe face risks of competition from other utilities or other entities authorized by federal, state or local agencies to expand rate-regulated or contracted utility services. Once a state utility regulator grants a franchise to a public utility to serve a specific territory, that utility effectively has an exclusive right to service that territory. Although a new franchise offers some protection against competitors, the pursuit of franchises is often competitive, particularly in Delaware, where new franchises may be awarded to utilities based upon competitive negotiation. Competing entities have challenged, and may challenge in the future, our applications for new franchises. Also, third parties entering into agreements to operate municipal utility systems may adversely affect the management of our long-term agreements to supply water or wastewater services on a contract basis to those municipalities, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have short-term and long-term contractual obligations for water, wastewater and storm water system operation and maintenance under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received.\nUSA-PA and USA operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for three New Jersey municipalities under 10-year contracts expiring in 2022, 2028 and 2030, respectively. These contracts do not protect us against incurring costs in excess of revenues we earn pursuant to the contracts. There can be no absolute assurance we will not experience losses resulting from these contracts. Losses under these contracts, or our failure or inability to perform or renew such agreements, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCapital market conditions and key assumptions may adversely impact the value of our postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities.\nMarket factors can adversely affect the rate of return on assets held in trusts to satisfy our future postretirement benefit obligations, as well negatively affect interest rates, which impacts the discount rates used in the determination of our postretirement benefit actuarial valuations. In addition, changes in demographics, such as increases in life expectancy assumptions, can increase future postretirement benefit obligations. Any negative impact to these factors, either individually or a combination thereof, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAn element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater assets, operations, contracts or companies. Any pending or future acquisitions we decide to undertake will involve risks.\nThe acquisition and/or operation of water and wastewater systems is an element of our growth strategy. This strategy depends on identifying suitable opportunities that meet our risk/reward profile and reaching mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates or contract parties. Further, acquisitions may result in dilution in the value of our equity securities, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and fluctuations in financial results. In addition, the assets, operations, contracts or companies we acquire may not achieve the revenues and profitability projected.\nIndex\nOur ability to achieve organic customer growth in our market area is dependent on the residential building market. New housing starts are one element that impacts our rate of growth and therefore, may not meet our expectations.\nWe expect our revenues to increase from customer growth for our regulated water and wastewater operations as a result of anticipated construction and sale of new housing units. If housing starts decline, or do not increase as we have projected as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, the timing and extent of our organic revenue growth may not meet our expectations, our deferred project costs may not produce revenue-generating projects in the timeframes anticipated and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThere can be no assurance we will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nWe have paid dividends on our common stock each year since 1912 and have increased the amount of dividends paid each year since 1973. Our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, applicable regulations and other factors, including the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases, will determine both our ability to pay dividends and the amount of those dividends. There can be no assurance we will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nIf we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents, our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance. Our performance is affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe believe cash generated from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under existing credit facilities, will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due. If, however, we do not generate sufficient cash, we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity, which may be on terms that are less favorable than we desire.\nNo assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed, or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default under these documents, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect demand for our water service and our revenues.\nDemand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during colder months due primarily to additional consumption of water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outdoor water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand may vary with temperature and rainfall levels. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.\nGeneral economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse economic conditions could negatively impact our customers\u2019 water usage demands, particularly the level of water usage demand by our commercial and industrial customers in our Middlesex System. If water demand by our commercial and industrial customers in our Middlesex System decreases, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted until completion of a subsequent base rate filing.\nIndex\nThe current concentration of our business in central New Jersey and in Delaware makes us susceptible to adverse developments in local regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and weather conditions.\nOur Middlesex System provides water services to customers located primarily in eastern Middlesex County, New Jersey. Water service is provided under wholesale contracts to the Townships of Edison, East Brunswick and Marlboro, the Borough of Highland Park, the Old Bridge Municipal Utilities Authority and the City of Rahway. We also provide water services to customers in the State of Delaware. Our revenues and operating results are therefore subject to local regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and weather conditions in a relatively concentrated geographic area. A change in any of these conditions could make it more costly for us to conduct our business.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover measures that may be used to discourage, delay or prevent changes of control that might benefit non-management shareholders.\nSubsection 10A of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, known as the New Jersey Shareholders Protection Act, applies to us. The Shareholders Protection Act deters merger proposals, tender offers or other attempts to effect changes in control that are not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we have a classified Board of Directors, which means only a portion of the Director population is elected each year. A classified Board can make it more difficult for an acquirer to gain control of the Company by voting its candidates onto the Board of Directors and may also deter merger proposals and tender offers. Our Board of Directors also has the ability, subject to obtaining NJBPU approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock having such number of shares, designation, preferences, voting rights, limitations and other rights as the Board of Directors may fix. This could be used by the Board of Directors to discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition the Board of Directors determines is not in the best interest of the common shareholders.\nGeneral Risks\nWe rely on our information technology systems to help manage our operations.\nOur information technology systems require periodic modifications, upgrades and/or replacement which subject us to costs and risks including potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial unanticipated capital expenditures, additional operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel and other risks in transitioning to new systems or integrating new systems. In addition, challenges implementing new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business operations.\nWe rely on our computer, information and communications technology systems in connection with the operation of our business, especially with respect to customer service and billing, accounting and, in some cases, the monitoring and operation of our operating facilities. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, cyber-attacks, power loss and internet, telecommunications or data network failures or acts of war or terrorism or similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause service interruption, delays and loss of critical data or, impede aspects of operations and therefore, adversely affect our financial results.\nCyber-attacks could result in the loss, or compromise, of customer, financial or operational data, disruption of billing, collections or normal field service activities, disruption of electronic monitoring and control of operational systems and delays in financial reporting and other management functions. Possible impacts associated with a cyber-incident may include remediation costs related to lost, stolen, or compromised data, repairs to data processing systems, increased cyber security protection costs, adverse effects on our compliance with regulatory and environmental laws and regulations, including standards for drinking water, litigation and reputational damage.\nIndex\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the attempt to contain it may harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOn January 16, 2022, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services renewed the determination that a nationwide health emergency exists as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The impact that COVID-19 will have on the Company, our customers and our vendors prospectively depends on numerous uncertainties, including the severity and duration of the pandemic and actions which could potentially be taken by federal or state governmental and/or regulatory authorities which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe depend significantly on the technical and management services of our team, and the departure of any of certain persons could cause our operating results to temporarily be short of our expectations.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our team. If we lose the services of certain members of our team, or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in key roles, our operating results could be negatively impacted.", "PERMNO": 53859, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "MSEX"}
