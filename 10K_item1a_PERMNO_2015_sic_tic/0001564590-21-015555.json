{"cik": "799288", "company": "LANDS' END, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our company and our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO MACROECONOMIC RISKS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business.\nThe outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business. In the United States and other regions, social distancing restrictions have been enacted.\nOur Company Operated stores temporarily closed on March 16, 2020 and reopened during the Second Quarter 2020. From time to time our employees have tested positive for COVID-19 or have come in close contact with individuals with COVID-19. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, due to COVID-19 illness, quarantine, or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Our vendors, manufacturers and other suppliers could be similarly adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply chain interruptions.\nAdditionally, an outbreak or perceived outbreak of COVID-19 connected to one or more of our offices, distribution facilities or Company Operated store locations could cause negative publicity directed at our brand and cause customers to avoid our products or Company Operated store locations. We cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, whether it will reoccur, what additional restrictions may be enacted or if individuals will be comfortable visiting our stores while adhering to social distancing protocols. Similarly, we cannot predict the effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the apparel or retail industry. All these factors could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe impact of economic conditions on consumer discretionary spending and on our business-to-business customers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nApparel purchases are discretionary expenditures that historically have been influenced by domestic and global economic conditions. The outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a national and global economic downturn. Consumer discretionary spending has weakened, and some experts are predicting that it will continue to weaken. Reduced discretionary spending could influence our sales which could have a material impact on our financial performance.\nGlobal and domestic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that have an effect on consumer discretionary spending include but may not be limited to: unemployment, general and industry-specific inflation, consumer confidence, consumer purchasing and saving habits, credit conditions, stock market performance, home values, population growth, household incomes and tax policies. Material changes to governmental policies related to domestic and international fiscal concerns, and/or changes in central bank policies with respect to monetary policy also could affect consumer discretionary spending. Any of these additional factors\naffecting consumer discretionary spending may further influence our customers\u2019 purchasing preferences, potentially having a further material impact on our financial performance.\nIn addition, over 50% of our national accounts business-to-business sales, made by Outfitters, are to travel-related companies. These customers\u2019 businesses have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore, caused a dramatic decrease in uniform sales to this sector. Should these travel-related companies continue to be adversely impacted, our sales to them would be affected. Similarly, our small and mid-size business customers\u2019 businesses have been adversely impacted, resulting in a decrease in sales to those organizations. The timing of the recovery of our small to mid-size business customers will impact our sales to those organizations. Finally, with the closure of schools and remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, our sales of school uniforms have been reduced. Should schools continue to operate remotely, school uniform sales would continue to be adversely impacted.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health or political crises or other catastrophic events.\nOur third-party vendors are located throughout the world including in locations subject to natural disasters or extreme weather conditions, as well as other potential catastrophic events, such as public health emergencies, including COVID-19, terrorist attacks, political or military conflict. The occurrence of any of these events could disrupt our operations and negatively impact sales of our products.\nUnseasonal or severe weather conditions may adversely affect our merchandise sales.\nOur business is adversely affected by unseasonal weather conditions. Sales of our spring and summer products, which traditionally consist of lighter clothing and swimwear, are adversely affected by cool or wet weather. Similarly, sales of our fall and winter products, which are traditionally weighted toward outerwear, are adversely affected by mild, dry or warm weather. In addition, severe weather events typically lead to temporarily reduced traffic at Company Operated store locations which could lead to reduced sales of our merchandise. Severe weather events may impact our ability to supply our Company Operated stores, deliver orders to customers in a timely manner and adequately staff our Company Operated stores and distribution centers, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO MICROECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nOur business is seasonal in nature and any decrease in our sales or margins could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal, with the highest levels of sales occurring during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Our sales and margins during the fourth quarter may fluctuate based upon factors such as the timing of holiday seasons, promotions, level of markdowns, competitive factors, weather and general economic conditions. Any decrease in sales or margins, whether as a result of increased promotional activity or because of economic conditions, poor weather or other factors, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods. We generally carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the fourth quarter peak selling periods. If we are not successful in selling inventory during these periods, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, with the seasonal nature of our business, over 2,000 flexible part-time employees join us each year to support our varying peak seasons, including the fourth quarter holiday shopping season. An inability to attract qualified seasonal personnel could interrupt our sales during this period.\nIncreases in postage, paper and printing costs could adversely affect the costs of producing and distributing our catalog and promotional mailings which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCatalog mailings are an important aspect of our marketing efforts. Increases in costs relating to postage, paper and printing would increase the cost of our catalog mailings and could reduce our profitability to the extent that we\nare unable to offset such increases by raising prices, by implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems or by using alternative direct-mail formats.\nWe currently use the national mail carriers for distribution of substantially all our catalogs and an increasing quantity of our outbound customer deliveries. Therefore, we are vulnerable to postal rate increases. The current economic and legislative environments may lead to further rate increases or a discontinuation of the discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes which the Company currently leverages for cost savings.\nPaper for catalogs and promotional mailings is a vital resource in the success of our business. The market price for paper has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. In addition, future pricing and supply availability of catalog paper may be impacted by the continued consolidation or closings of production facilities in the United States. We do not have multi-year fixed-price contracts for the supply of paper and are not guaranteed access to, or reasonable prices for, the amounts required for the operation of our business over the long term.\nWe also depend upon external vendors to print and mail our catalogs. Partially due to the consolidation of printing companies, there is a limited number of printers that can handle such needs which subjects us to risks if any printer fails to perform as required.\nOur approach to merchandise promotions and markdowns to encourage consumer purchases could adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations.\nThe apparel industry is dominated by large brands and national/mass retailers, where price competition, promotion, and branded product assortment drive differentiation between competitors in the industry. In order to be competitive, we must offer customers compelling products at attractive prices. In recent periods, the use of promotions and markdowns, as appropriate, is a strategy we have employed to offer attractive prices. Heavy reliance on promotions and markdowns to encourage customers to purchase our merchandise, could have a negative impact on our brand equity, gross margins and results of operations.\nOur leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry. The agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe have significant debt service obligations. Our debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. Our level of debt presents the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\nwe could be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal (including amortization) and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nour substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nour interest expense could increase if prevailing interest rates increase, because a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nour debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, our industry and changing market conditions and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies;\n\u2022\nour level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nthe agreements governing our debt contain covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments and investments;\n\u2022\nthe agreements governing our debt contain operating covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best interests in the long term, including, without limitation, by restricting our subsidiaries' ability to incur debt, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates or prepay certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nthe agreements governing our debt contain certain financial covenants, including a quarterly maximum total leverage ratio test, a weekly minimum liquidity test and an annual maximum capital expenditure amount (the \u201cfinancial covenants\u201d); and\n\u2022\nthe failure to comply with the operating and financial covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the applicable debt or may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and in the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that debt and the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Our ability to meet these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will meet them.\nWe may need additional financing in the future for our general corporate purposes or growth strategies and anticipate the need to refinance our long term debt and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes or growth strategies. In addition, we anticipate the need to refinance some, or all, of the ABL Facility that matures in November 2022. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing or refinance the ABL Facility on terms favorable to us, or at all, depending on market and other conditions. The ability to raise additional financing depends on numerous factors that are outside of our control, including general economic and market conditions, the health of financial institutions, our credit ratings and lenders' assessments of our prospects and the prospects of the retail industry in general, all of which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lenders, under any credit facilities or loan agreements we may execute, may not be able to meet their commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance our products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we are not able to fulfill our liquidity needs through operating cash flows and/or borrowings under credit facilities or otherwise in the capital markets, our business and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe could incur charges due to impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets.\nAs of January 29, 2021, we had goodwill and intangible asset balances totaling $363.7 million, which are subject to testing for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our intangible assets consist of a trade name of $257.0 million and goodwill of $106.7 million. Any event that impacts our reputation could result in impairment charges for our trade name. Long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment, are also subject to testing for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in our impairment assessment. If actual results fall short of our estimates and assumptions used in estimating revenue growth, future cash flows and asset fair values, we could incur further impairment charges for intangible assets, goodwill or long-lived assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO BRAND AND BRAND EXECUTION\nIf customer preference for our branded merchandise and services changes or we cannot compete effectively in the apparel industry, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur products and services must satisfy the desires of customers, whose preferences change over time. Sales of branded merchandise account for substantially all our total revenues and the Lands' End brand is a critical differentiating factor for our business. Our inability to develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, our inability to maintain our strict quality standards or to develop, produce and deliver\ninnovative products in a timely manner, or any unfavorable publicity with respect to the foregoing or otherwise could negatively impact the image of our brand with our customers and could result in diminished loyalty to our brand. As customer preferences change, our failure to anticipate, identify and react in a timely manner to emerging trends and appropriately provide attractive high-quality products that maintain or enhance the appeal of our brand through our websites, catalogs and Company Operated stores could have an adverse effect on our sales, operating margins and results of operations.\nThe apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer companies and retailers, including national department store chains, women's and men's specialty apparel chains, apparel catalog businesses, sportswear marketers and online apparel businesses that sell similar lines of merchandise. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors. Our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies, adapt to changes in customer preferences or requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the design, sourcing, distribution, marketing and sale of their products, or generate greater national brand recognition than we can. An inability to overcome these potential competitive disadvantages or effectively market our products relative to our competitors could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Similarly, our inability to market and sell our products in foreign jurisdictions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our overall marketing strategies for digital marketing and direct mail catalogs and customers' use of our digital platform, including our eCommerce websites.\nThe success of our business depends on customers' use of our eCommerce websites and their response to our digital marketing and direct mail catalogs. The level of customer traffic and volume of customer purchases on our eCommerce websites is substantially dependent on our ability to provide attractive and accessible websites, maintain a robust customer list, provide a high-quality customer experience and reliable delivery of our merchandise. If we are unable to maintain and increase customer traffic to our eCommerce websites and the volume of goods they purchase, including, as a result of changes to the level and types of marketing or amount of spend allocated to each type of marketing, or through our failure to otherwise successfully promote and maintain our eCommerce websites and their associated services, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company has been increasing its investment in digital marketing and optimizing its catalog productivity. Digital marketing costs now exceed direct mail catalog costs and this shift in marketing strategy could have a negative impact if customers that previously relied on the direct mail catalog do not respond as favorably through the digital marketing channel.\nAny future privacy rules or other regulations could adversely impact our business to the extent we need to limit or change our digital marketing efforts.\nIf we are unable to protect or preserve the image of our brands, our reputation and our intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe regard our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. As such, we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our associates, consultants, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and we may have trouble in effectively limiting unauthorized use of our trademarks and other intellectual property worldwide. Unauthorized use of our trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other proprietary rights may cause significant damage to our brands and our ability to effectively represent ourselves to agents, suppliers, vendors, licensees and/or customers.\nAdditionally, our efforts to pursue licensing and wholesaling activities with third parties increases risk of brand damage. If third parties do not adhere to our standards or if we fail to maintain the image of our brands due to merchandise and service quality issues, adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, or other reasons, our brands and reputation could be damaged, and our business may be adversely affected.\nThird parties may sue us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The party claiming infringement might have greater resources than we do to pursue its claims, and we could be forced to incur substantial costs and devote significant management resources to defend against such litigation. If the party claiming infringement were to prevail, we could be forced to discontinue the use of the related trademark or design, pay significant damages, or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party, assuming these royalty or licensing arrangements are economically feasible, which they may not be.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with services in connection with certain aspects of our business, and any failure by these third parties to perform their obligations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for logistics services, information technology systems (including website hosting), credit card processing, onshore and offshore software development and support, catalog production, distribution and packaging and employee benefits. Services provided by any of our third-party suppliers could be interrupted as a result of many factors, such as acts of nature or contract disputes. Any failure by a third party to provide us with contracted-for services on a timely basis or within service level expectations and performance standards could result in a disruption of our business and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Company Operated stores may not be successful and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur Company Operated stores are dependent on our ability to operate all locations effectively and attract customers with a compelling assortment. Our Company Operated store operations include managing the store and recruiting and hiring store management and associates. In addition, we are required to implement retail-specific marketing plans, and enhance inventory management skills specific to retail, such as those related to allocation and replenishment of product. If customers are not receptive of our store locations and concept, customer traffic, projected store sales and profitability may suffer.\nRISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY CHAIN AND GLOBAL OPERATIONS\nIf we fail to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our vendors and deliver merchandise to our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third-party vendors for the manufacture of our merchandise. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect timely and effective procurement of supplies of product from our vendors. The products that we purchase must be shipped to our distribution centers in Wisconsin, the United Kingdom and Japan. While our reliance on a limited number of distribution centers provides certain efficiencies, it also makes us more vulnerable to unforeseen causes that could delay or impair our ability to fulfill customer orders and/or ship merchandise to our Company Operated stores. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning, as well as business continuity planning. Our utilization of imports also makes us vulnerable to risks associated with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things, risks of damage, destruction or confiscation of products while in transit to a distribution center, organized labor strikes and work stoppages, transportation and other delays in shipments, heightened security screening and inspection processes or other port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United States, the United Kingdom (including as a result of Brexit), the Netherlands and Japan, unexpected or significant port congestion, lack of freight availability and freight cost increases.\nWe rely upon third-party land-based and air freight carriers for merchandise shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activity, inclement weather and increased transportation costs, associated with such carriers' ability to provide delivery services to meet outbound shipping needs. As a result of shifting consumer behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain freight carriers are deemphasizing historical, large commercial customers in favor of higher\nmargin individual customers. The changing mix of our outbound freight carriers may result in higher costs and customer delays. In addition, if the cost of fuel rises or surcharges increase, the cost to deliver merchandise from distribution centers to customers may rise, and, although some of these costs are paid by our customers, such costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Any increase in shipping costs and surcharges may have an adverse effect on our profitability and future financial performance.\nFluctuations and increases in the cost, availability, and quality of raw materials as well as fluctuations in other production and distribution related costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur products are manufactured using several key raw materials, including wool, cotton and down, which are subject to fluctuations in price and availability and many of which are produced in emerging markets in Asia and Central America. The prices of these raw materials can be volatile due to the demand for fabrics, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, general economic conditions, crop yields and other unpredictable factors. Such factors may be exacerbated by legislation and regulations associated with global climate change. The prices of these raw materials may also fluctuate based on a number of other factors beyond our control, including commodity prices such as prices for oil, changes in supply and demand, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, currency exchange rates and government regulation. These fluctuations in cost, availability and quality of raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise may result in an increase in our costs to purchase products from our vendors and could have an adverse effect on our cost of goods.\nIf we do not accurately forecast our inventory needs, efficiently manage inventory levels and have proper controls to protect our inventory, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully, but we must also avoid accumulating excess inventory, which increases working capital needs and could lower gross margins. Sufficient inventory levels are maintained by our ability to accurately forecast the product needs for each channel, our ability to accurately report our inventory levels and our ability to protect those assets.\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the future customer demand for a particular product, be able to report the current inventory level for a particular product, protect the physical inventory or project the time it will take to obtain new inventory, inventory levels will not be appropriate, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe obtain substantially all our inventory from vendors located outside the United States. Some of these vendors require lengthy advance notice of order requirements in order to be able to supply products in the quantities requested. This usually requires us to order merchandise and enter into commitments for the purchase of such merchandise well in advance of the time these products will be offered for sale, which makes responding to changing markets challenging.\nOur own websites, third party suppliers and third-party marketplaces rely on our ability to report accurate inventories by style, color and size to support customer orders. This includes the ability to exchange accurate inventory information with third parties, whether that represents our inventory on their website or represents their inventory on our website.\nWe store high volumes of inventory and are subject to the attendant risks of inventory loss, spoilage, shrink, scrap and theft (which we collectively refer to as \"shrinkage\"). Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage, be unable to accurately record inventory transactions or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDeterioration of relationships with our vendors and/or the failure of our new merchandise sourcing initiatives could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and operational results.\nWe have long standing relationships with the vendors that supply a significant portion of our merchandise, but do not operate under long-term agreements. Therefore, our success relies on maintaining good relations with these\nvendors. Our growth strategy depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to efficiently supply merchandise that is consistent with our standards for quality and value. In the event we engage new vendors, it may cause us to encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to guide and educate our vendors in producing our products and adhering to our standards. If we cannot obtain a sufficient amount and variety of quality product at acceptable prices it could have a negative impact on our competitive position. This could result in lower revenues and decreased customer interest in our product offerings, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur arrangements with our vendors are generally not exclusive. As a result, our vendors might be able to sell similar or identical products to our competitors, some of which purchase products in significantly greater volume. Our competitors may enter into arrangements with suppliers that could impair our ability to sell those suppliers' products, including by requiring suppliers to enter into exclusive arrangements, which could limit our access to such arrangements or products.\nOur merchandising sourcing strategies increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain and include both vendor rationalization and vendor productivity. In the event these strategies are unsuccessful our business could be adversely affected.\nOur reputation and customers' willingness to purchase our products depend in part on our vendors' compliance with ethical employment practices, such as with respect to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, freedom of association, unlawful inducements, safe and healthy working conditions, and with all legal and regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of their business and safety standards of materials. While we operate compliance and monitoring programs to promote ethical and lawful business practices and verify compliance with safety standards, we do not exercise ultimate control over our independent vendors or their business practices and cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical and lawful business practices and safety standards. Violation of ethical, labor, safety, or other standards by vendors, or the divergence of a vendor's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States could hurt our reputation or materially impact our ability to import products manufactured by these vendors or from the regions in which they operate, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe conduct business in and rely on sources for merchandise located in foreign markets and our business may therefore be adversely affected by legal, regulatory, economic and political risks associated with international trade in those markets.\nThe majority of our merchandise is manufactured in Asia and South America, depending on the nature of the product mix. These products are either imported directly by us or indirectly by distributors who, in turn, sell products to us. Any increase in the cost of merchandise purchased from these vendors or restrictions on the merchandise made available by these vendors could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe also sell our products globally. Our reliance on vendors in foreign markets and the marketing of products to customers in foreign markets creates risks inherent in doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including:\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions;\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability in the countries and regions where our customers or vendors are located;\n\u2022\nadverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncompliance with United States and other country laws relating to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022\nchanges in United States and non-United States laws affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, enhanced security measures at United States ports, or imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas;\n\u2022\nincreases in shipping, labor, fuel, travel and other transportation costs;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty proceedings resulting in the potential assessment of special anti-dumping or countervailing duties;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions, including those due to the failure of vendors or distributors to comply with import regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and acts of terrorism; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs in the United States that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions.\nAny inability on our part to rely on our foreign sources of production due to any of the factors listed above could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union effective January 31, 2020 and concluded a trade agreement with the European Union days before the December 31, 2020 end of the transition period. Given the shortness of time, there remains considerable uncertainty around the impact of new, post-Brexit regulations, volatility in the securities markets and in currency exchange rates. As new regulations are developed and the implementation of such matures, we could incur additional costs and customs duties fulfilling orders in Europe which could adversely affect our business.\nOur efforts to expand our channels and geographic reach may not be successful.\nOur strategy includes initiatives to further our reach in the United States and in several countries throughout the world, through various channels and brands, including through relationships with third party eCommerce marketplaces. We have limited experience operating in many of these locations and with third parties and face major, established competitors. We may also experience barriers to entry. We may seek additional business partners or licensees to assist us in these efforts, however we may not be successful in establishing such relationships. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations from those in our existing locations, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or profitable. If our expansion efforts are not successful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our business could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\nIf we do not maintain our current information technology systems or fail to effectively implement new information technology systems, it could result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nWe rely upon sophisticated systems to operate our business including web sites, point of sale, telecommunications, email, inventory management, warehouse management, and financial and human resources. Some of these systems are based on end-of-life or legacy technology, operate with minimal or no vendor support and are otherwise difficult to maintain. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees or vendors. Operating legacy systems subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading and replacing these systems. We must recruit and retain sufficiently skilled personnel to maintain and operate the systems and demands on management time along with other risks and costs. Our eCommerce websites are subject to numerous risks associated with selling merchandise, including unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third-party computer hardware and software providers and system failures.\nOur strategic initiatives include implementing new information technology systems, support, and infrastructure enhancements to provide improved capabilities to better serve our customers and accommodate future growth. Implementation of these systems is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software, hardware and cloud-based system providers and internal business teams. Additionally, the deployment of new technology systems,\nmay require substantial investments in our infrastructure and network. As we deploy, update and make enhancements, we must, among other things, continue to update internal controls and operational processes as implementation progresses, recruit and train qualified personnel to assist with change management, and conduct, manage and control routine business functions.\nWe plan to start the planning and implementation of a multi-year project for a new warehouse management system in Fiscal 2021. Implementation of a warehouse management system is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The interdependence of these systems is a significant risk to the successful completion and the failure could have a material adverse effect on our overall information technology infrastructure. The first phase of this project will be focused on labor savings and package consolidation while optimizing our third party carrier rates. We expect this implementation to drive operational efficiencies and working capital improvements. We may experience difficulties as we transition to the new warehouse management system, including inability to receive product from vendors, inability to ship or delayed shipments to customers, decreases in productivity as our personnel and third-party providers implement and become familiar with the new warehouse management system, loss or corruption of data and increased costs and lost revenues.\nAny difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, including loss or corruption of data, could delay implementation and deployment of new technologies, delayed shipments, decreases in productivity. Failure to successfully deploy new technologies, enhancements of the infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies consumers' expectations, could have an adverse impact on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we do not adequately protect against cyber security threats or maintain the security of customer, employee or company information, we could experience significant business interruption, damage to our reputation, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.\nOur information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion and targeted or random cyber-attacks. Although we have invested in the protection and monitoring of our information technology network, proprietary and customer data and systems, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breaches in our information technology systems that could adversely affect our business.\nThe regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and rapidly changing requirements applicable to our business. We could be held liable to our customers or other parties or be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy and information security laws and regulations, and our business and reputation could be adversely affected by any resulting loss of customer confidence, litigation, civil or criminal penalties or adverse publicity.\nAny significant compromise or breach of customer, employee or company data security, could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. There is no guarantee that the procedures that the Company or our third-party providers have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches.\nRISKS RELATED TO MAJORITY OWNERSHIP\nESL, whose interests may be different from the interests of other stockholders, may be able to exert substantial influence over our company.\nAccording to an amendment to Schedule 13D filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, ESL beneficially owned 55.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 1, 2021. Accordingly, ESL could have substantial influence over many, if not all, actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders, including in the election of directors and any transactions involving a change of control. The interests of ESL, which has investments in other\ncompanies (including Sears Holdings and Transform Holdco), may from time to time diverge from the interests of our other stockholders.\nOur common stock price may decline if ESL decides to sell a portion of its holdings of our common stock.\nESL is not subject to any contractual obligation to maintain its ownership position in us. Consequently, we cannot assure you that ESL will maintain its ownership interest in us. Any sale by ESL of our common stock, or any announcement by ESL that it has decided to sell shares of our common stock, could have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nPotential liabilities may arise related to the Separation, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations.\nThe Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Sears Holdings Corporation has filed a lawsuit against ESL, former Sears directors and others alleging that several transactions, including the Separation, can be avoided as fraudulent transfers, and attacking the Separation and the decision to undertake the Separation on other similar theories of liability. If a court were to determine that the Separation was voidable, in whole or in part, then subject to various defenses, the court might require ESL or other recipients of value received in connection with the Separation (potentially including our stockholders as recipients of shares of our common stock in connection with the Separation), to return some or all of the property received, or enter judgment against the recipient in the amount of the some or all of the value received. If any of the agreements we entered into with Sears as part of the Separation (or payments we received thereunder) are challenged and avoided, subject to various defenses, the court might require us to return some or all of the property received, or enter judgment against us in the amount of some or all of the value received, under or in connection with those agreements.\nGENERAL RISKS\nFailure to retain our executive management team and to attract qualified new personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the talents and continued efforts of our executive management team. The loss of members of our executive management may disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to manage further expansion will require us to continue to train, motivate and manage employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably.\nOther factors may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany other factors may affect our profitability and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations and changes in their interpretation or application, including changes in accounting standards, taxation rates and requirements, product marketing application standards and environmental laws;\n\u2022\ndifferences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;\n\u2022\nchanges in the rate of inflation, interest rates and the performance of investments held by us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in business, economic and political conditions, including war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups; and\n\u2022\nthe Company is self-insured for employee medical claims and workers\u2019 compensation claims. If there were negative claim experiences and higher than normal large claims this could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nOur share price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to several factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nchanges to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions.\nFurther, when the market price of a company's common stock drops significantly, stockholders often initiate securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against the Company could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our senior management and other resources.\nYour percentage ownership in Lands' End may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in Lands' End may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, strategic investments, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees.\nExposure to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, including with respect to product liability claims. These proceedings may be affected by changes in laws and government regulations or changes in their enforcement.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business or products we sell or have sold. These proceedings may be in jurisdictions with reputations for aggressive application of laws and procedures against corporate defendants. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection and employment laws, including wage and hour laws, privacy laws, and laws relating to eCommerce. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPotential assessments for additional state taxes, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn accordance with current law, we pay, collect and/or remit taxes for Federal, State and local and foreign jurisdictions where we are required by law. While we believe that we have appropriately remitted all taxes based on our interpretation of applicable law, tax laws are complex, and their application differs by taxing jurisdiction.\nAn increasing number of taxing jurisdictions may attempt to assess additional taxes and penalties on us or assert an error in our calculation. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. A change in the application of law, or an interpretation of the law that differs from our own may, if successful, adversely affect our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14544, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "LE"}
