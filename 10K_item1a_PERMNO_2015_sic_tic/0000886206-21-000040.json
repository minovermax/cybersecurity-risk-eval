{"cik": "886206", "company": "FRANKLIN COVEY CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business environment, current domestic and international economic conditions, impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical circumstances, changing social standards, and other specific risks may affect our future business decisions and financial performance. The matters discussed below may cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward-looking statements and could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and stock price, and should be considered in evaluating our Company.\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional risk factors which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing global environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Further, the disclosure of risks identified below does not imply that the risk has already materialized.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially impacted in the future by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 and its variants has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption during late fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. These conditions have adversely affected our consolidated sales during fiscal 2021 as some workplaces and schools remained closed in response to the pandemic. The recovery from COVID-19 has thus far been uneven as case numbers have fluctuated and increased in certain areas of the world, which has caused continued business, educational, and social disruptions. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope, and severity of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals\u2019 actions that have been taken, and continue to be taken, in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on worldwide economic activity, including ensuing supply chain issues, and actions taken in response; the effect on our clients, including educational and governmental institutions, and client demand for our services; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including the impact of travel restrictions, people working from remote locations, and limitations on in-person interactions and events; the ability of our clients to pay for our services on a timely basis or at all; the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity; and any closure of our offices. Any of these events, or related conditions, could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties described throughout this section of our Annual Report and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price.\nTraining Industry and Related Risks\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry and our competitors may develop programs, services, or courses that adversely affect our ability to sell our offerings.\nThe training and consulting services industry is intensely competitive with relatively easy entry. Competitors continually introduce new programs, services, and delivery methods that may compete directly with our offerings, or that may make our offerings uncompetitive or obsolete. Larger competitors may have superior abilities to compete for clients and skilled professionals, reducing our ability to deliver quality work to our clients. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, one or more of our competitors may develop and implement\ntraining courses or methodologies that may adversely affect our ability to sell our offerings and products to new clients. Any one of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business and successfully deliver our services.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients\u2019 businesses and their levels of business activity.\nGlobal economic and political conditions affect our clients\u2019 businesses and the markets in which they operate. Instability in the global credit markets; the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy; the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom \u201cBrexit\u201d withdrawal from the European Union; the current economic challenges in China, including the global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic, political, and market conditions, or conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur financial results are somewhat dependent on the amount that current and prospective clients budget for training. A serious and/or prolonged economic downturn combined with a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients\u2019 financial condition and the amount budgeted for training by our clients. These conditions may reduce the demand for our services or depress the pricing of those services and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions may also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Such economic, political, and client spending conditions are influenced by a wide range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. If we are unable to successfully anticipate these changing conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business success also depends in part upon continued growth in the use of training and consulting services and the renewal of existing contracts by our clients. In challenging economic environments, our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new services and consulting solutions in order to focus on other priorities. At the same time, many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting their business and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel and/or processes. If growth in the general use of training and consulting services in business or our clients\u2019 spending on these items declines, or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new services and solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and, consequently, the benefits of an economic recovery following a period of economic downturn may take longer for us to realize than other segments of the economy.\nFailure to maintain our reputation, brand image, and culture could negatively impact our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting, and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, content and platform innovation and quality, and our efforts in these respects may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives.\nOur brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity, purpose, and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our culture and values, our products, services and experiences, consumer data, or any of our affiliates could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Further, our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of, association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes, as well as any decisions we make to continue to\nconduct, or change, certain of our activities in response to such considerations. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation, culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSome terminology, language, or content in our offerings may be deemed offensive by certain individuals due to rapidly changing societal norms, which may cause damage to our brand or reputation.\nOur mission is to enable greatness in individuals and organizations regardless of race, religion, gender, or other individual characteristics. We write and design our content and materials to accomplish this mission and believe that the principles we teach improve lives. Through our directly owned offices and international licensees, our content is delivered in numerous countries around the world in different languages and in different cultures. The language, graphics, and examples used in our content and materials may be understood and interpreted differently by individuals based on culture, experience, societal norms, and other factors. As a result, some individuals may find some of the content in our materials offensive. While we have developed an ongoing review process to remove potentially offensive terms or images from our materials, a rapidly changing cultural and social environment may create unfavorable interpretations of language or images faster than we can identify and remediate them. Although our intent is to educate and improve individual lives and organizational cultures without offense, an unfavorable interpretation by an individual or organization of the language, concepts, or images used in our content or materials may harm our reputation and brand, cause us to lose business, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.\nOur financial success is partially dependent on our ability to protect our proprietary offerings and other intellectual property. The existing laws of some countries in which we provide services might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. To protect our intellectual property, we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright and trademark laws. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights, especially in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe loss of proprietary content or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may create greater competition, loss of revenue, adverse publicity, and may limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property with other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future engagements.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individuals could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, and retain additional qualified senior personnel. Competition for such individuals in the current labor market and in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality employees, including sales personnel and training consultants, we may not be able to grow our business as projected or may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur success and ability to grow are partially dependent on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve our clients and grow our business. Competition for skilled personnel is intense at all levels of experience and seniority. There is a risk that we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require, or that it will prove difficult to retain\nthem in a competitive labor market. If we are unable to hire and retain talented sales and delivery employees with the skills, and in the locations, we require, we might not be able to grow our business at projected levels or may not be able to effectively deliver our content and services. If we need to hire additional personnel to maintain a specified number of sales personnel or are required to re-assign personnel from other geographic areas, it could increase our costs and adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, the inability of newly hired sales personnel to achieve increased sales metrics as they progress may inhibit our ability to attain anticipated sales growth.\nOur work with governmental clients exposes us to additional risks that are inherent in the government contracting process.\nOur clients include national, state, provincial, and local governmental entities, and our work with these governmental entities has various risks inherent in the governmental contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, the governmental entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of, or terminate, these projects for lack of approved funding, budgetary changes, and other discretionary reasons. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could result in changes in the scope of, or in termination of, our existing contracts.\n\uf0b7Governmental entities often reserve the right to audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to our government contracts. Findings from an audit may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed upon rates for our work, which may affect our future margins.\n\uf0b7If a governmental client discovers improper activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions, or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.\n\uf0b7Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of elections, revisions to governmental tax policies, sequestration, debt ceiling negotiations, and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new governmental contracts signed.\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular governmental agency involved, but also our business with other agencies of the same or other governmental entities. Additionally, because of their visibility and political nature, governmental contracts may present a heightened risk to our reputation. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.\nCybersecurity and Information Technology Risks\nThe All Access Pass and Leader in Me subscription services are internet-based platforms, and as such we are subject to increased risks of cyber-attacks and other security breaches that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of selling subscription-based services, we collect, process, and retain a limited amount of sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. Because our subscription services are internet-based platforms, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, stolen intellectual property, programming or human errors, or other similar events.\nThe access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information, software, methodologies, and business secrets could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products, and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, our brand and reputation could be affected, and these conditions could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe could incur additional liabilities or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or if our information systems are breached.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients. Security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We are also required at times to manage, utilize, and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personal data. If we, our associates, business partners, or our service providers negligently disregard or intentionally breach our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.\nLegal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, the European Union (EU) and the U.S. formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that provided a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework on the grounds that the Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal data transferred to the United States. The same decision also raised questions about whether one of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely, the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), can lawfully be used for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States or most other countries. Similarly, on September 8, 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner announced that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is inadequate for personal information transfers from Switzerland to the United States, and also raised questions about the viability of the SCCs, in particular in relation to transfers of data to the United States. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission adopted new SCCs, which impose on companies additional obligations relating to data transfers, including the obligation to conduct a transfer impact assessment and, depending on a party\u2019s role in the transfer and the laws and practices of the destination country, to implement additional security measures, and to update internal privacy practices. Regulatory guidance suggests that certain transfers of personal data to the United States could be compliant only if the recipient is able to implement specific technical and procedural security controls to protect that personal data, and such controls may not be practical for certain service delivery models, in particular cloud services. If we elect to rely on the new SCCs for data transfers, we may be required to incur significant time and resources to update our contractual arrangements, implement the supplementary security measures, and to comply with new obligations. The new SCCs may increase the legal risks and liabilities under EU laws associated with cross-border data transfers, and result in material increased compliance and operational costs. Compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that may result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity. The inability to import personal information from Europe to the United States or other countries may decrease demand for our products and services as our customers that are subject to such laws may seek alternatives that do not involve personal information transfers out of Europe. Our inability to import personal information to the United States and other countries may decrease the functionality or effectiveness of our products and services and adversely impact our marketing efforts, plans and activities.\nIn addition, during May 2018 the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective in the European Union. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on the collection, use, security, and transfer of personal information in and from EU member states. The GDPR is designed to unify data protection within the EU under a single law, which may result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs related to our EU operations and customers. Under GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to four percent of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed. Although GDPR applies across the European Union, local data protection authorities still have the ability to interpret GDPR, which may create inconsistencies in application on a country-by-country basis. Furthermore, as the United Kingdom transitions out of the EU, we may encounter additional complexity with respect to data privacy and data transfers to and from the United Kingdom. We have implemented new controls and procedures, including a team\ndedicated to data protection, to comply with the requirements of GDPR as well as the UK GDPR. However, these new procedures and controls may not be completely effective in preventing unauthorized breaches of personal data.\nFurther, on August 20, 2021, China adopted the PRC Personal Information Protection Law, or PIPL. The PIPL took effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL establishes comprehensive requirements relating to the collection, use, transfer, security, and other processing of personal information in or from China. The PIPL incorporates many requirements common to international privacy laws, such as GDPR, and adds unique regulatory requirements relating to data localization, international data transfers, consumer consent, the processing of \u201csensitive personal information,\u201d and the operations of certain \u201cinternet platform services.\u201d Several key provisions of the PIPL remain undefined, including important thresholds, definitions, and requirements concerning the scope and limitations on international data transfers, data localization, and internet platform services. Fines and penalties under the PIPL range from fines up to RMB 50,000,000 or five percent of global annual turnover, to the cancellation of business authorizations, personal liability or professional restrictions for responsible company officers, as well as criminal and civil liability. As regulatory agencies in China did not make public certain rules as of PIPL\u2019s effective date, a full assessment of the risks and impact of the law and relevant compliance requirements has not been possible and we may have a limited period to become compliant. In the event the law requires us to store data in China, or limits our ability to transfer data across borders, we may experience increased costs, business inefficiencies, lost sales, decreased demand, and decreased competitiveness, as we may be unable to provide our services or certain features, or provide them in an efficient or centralized manner. Additionally, local companies may be favored by customers who will not consent to or accept transfer of their data out of China. Fines, corrective actions, or other penalties asserted due to alleged noncompliance may impose additional financial or operational costs, limit our ability to attract and retain local talent, or limit our ability to do business in China. These risks may be magnified due to regulatory uncertainty and short periods to achieve compliance. Additionally, under the PIPL, we may be subject to additional liabilities, claims, penalties, or causes of action in the event of a breach of customer personal information.\nOther governmental authorities throughout the U.S. and around the world are considering or have adopted similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA), which was effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of data sales, as well as certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new private cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA) was approved by California voters in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will create additional obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning on July 1, 2023. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. These privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve and could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, or restrict our use or storage of personal information, which may increase our compliance risk and expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct.\nWe employ global best practices in securing and monitoring code, applications, systems, processes, and data, and our security practices are regularly reviewed and validated by an external auditing firm. However, these efforts may be insufficient to protect sensitive information against illegal activities and we may be exposed to additional liabilities from the various data protection laws enacted within the jurisdictions where we operate.\nOur business is becoming increasingly dependent on information technology and will require additional cash investments in order to grow and meet the demands of our clients.\nSince the introduction of our online subscription services, our dependence on the use of sophisticated technologies and information systems has increased. Moreover, our technology platforms will require continuing cash investments (including business acquisitions such as the acquisition of Strive in fiscal 2021) by us to expand existing offerings, improve the client experience, and develop complementary offerings. Our future success depends in part on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure while continuing to improve the performance, features, and reliability of our services\nin response to the evolving demands of the marketplace. Failure to adapt and improve these areas could have an adverse effect on our business, including our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Risks\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our payment obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, including the performance of our subsidiaries, which will be affected by financial, business and economic conditions, competition, and other factors. We are unable to control many of these factors, such as the general economy, economic conditions in the industries in which we operate, and competitive pressures. Our cash flows may be insufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may be unsuccessful and we may not meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our 2019 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and subsequent modifications, may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nIn the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness before maturity or as it matures, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness at all. If interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, we will incur higher interest expense. Furthermore, if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook, our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our financial condition and financial results.\nFailure to comply with the terms and conditions of our credit facility may have an adverse effect upon our business and operations.\nOur secured credit agreement and subsequent modifications require us to be in compliance with customary non-financial terms and conditions as well as specified financial ratios. Failure to comply with these terms and conditions or maintain adequate financial performance to comply with specific financial ratios entitles the lender to certain remedies, including the right to immediately call due any amounts owed on the credit agreement. Such events would have an adverse effect upon our business and operations as there can be no assurance that we may be able to obtain other forms of financing or raise additional capital on terms that would be acceptable to us.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and this capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt offerings or equity financings in order to:\n\uf0b7Develop new services, programs, or offerings\n\uf0b7Take advantage of opportunities, including business acquisitions\n\uf0b7Respond to competitive pressures\nGoing forward, we will continue to incur costs necessary for the day-to-day operation and potential growth of the business and may use our available revolving line of credit facility and other financing alternatives, if necessary, for these expenditures. We obtained a new credit agreement in August 2019 with our existing lender that expires in August 2024. We expect to regularly renew or amend our lending agreement in the future to maintain the availability of this credit facility. Additional potential sources of liquidity available to us include factoring receivables, issuance of additional equity, or issuance of debt from public or private sources. If necessary, we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated cost of capital.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary capital on terms or conditions that are favorable to us, or at all.\nPublic Company Risks\nWe may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These periodic reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts\u2019 estimates of our future performance. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based on their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. The price of our common stock could, however, decline if an analyst downgrades our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If analysts do not continue to follow us or if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in securities litigation following a decline in price. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nOur business performance may not be sufficient for us to meet the financial guidance that we provide publicly.\nWe may provide financial guidance to the public based upon expectations regarding our financial performance. While we believe that our annual financial guidance provides investors and analysts with insight into our view of the Company\u2019s future performance, such financial guidance is based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results. If we fail to meet the financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur future quarterly operating results are subject to factors that can cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, our stock price has experienced significant volatility. We expect that our stock price may continue to experience volatility in the future due to a variety of potential factors that may include the following:\n\uf0b7Fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flows\n\uf0b7Increased overall market volatility\n\uf0b7Variations between our actual financial results and market expectations\n\uf0b7Changes in our key balances, such as cash and cash equivalents\n\uf0b7Currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\uf0b7Unexpected asset impairment charges\nThese factors, among others, may have an adverse effect upon our stock price in the future.\nGeneral Business Risks\nOur global operations pose complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax, and economic risks, which we may not adequately address.\nWe have sales offices in Australia, China, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the United Kingdom. We also have licensed operations in numerous other foreign countries. As a result of these foreign operations and their impact upon our financial statements, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\uf0b7Restrictions on the movement of cash\n\uf0b7Burdens of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws, including tax laws\n\uf0b7The absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights\n\uf0b7Political instability\n\uf0b7Currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\uf0b7Longer payment cycles\n\uf0b7Price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies\nThis includes, for example, the effect of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, including implementation of the legal and regulatory framework that applies to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union and other countries, as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the United States and elsewhere. The consequences of Brexit, together with the continuing uncertainty regarding the terms on which the U.K. will interact with the EU, could introduce significant volatility into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. Brexit could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our customers in the U.K. are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, including U.K. competition law. Following the trade deal reached between the U.K. and the end of the transition period, we have experienced or expect to experience impacts on our operations from the following:\n\uf0b7More stringent rules of origin on goods traded between the U.K. and the EU;\n\uf0b7additional procedures related to goods traded between the EU and non-EU countries;\n\uf0b7limited transportation availability for a period, as a result of delays at borders between the U.K. and EU; and\n\uf0b7new product registration requirements applicable including to avoid any new tariffs or quotas, or as a result of REACH and the new U.K. REACH regime.\nWhile we believe that some of these adverse impacts will be resolved in the coming months as the U.K. becomes accustomed to operating independent of the EU, we may in the future experience further adverse consequences such as increased costs of conducting business in the U.K., deterioration in economic conditions in the U.K., volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation, any of which could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.\nBecause we provide services to clients in many countries, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, regulations on matters as diverse as import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, government affairs, internal and disclosure control obligations, data privacy, and labor relations. Violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages, fines, unfavorable publicity, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may be insufficient to protect our rights.\nIn many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits giving anything of value intended to influence the awarding of government contracts. Although we have policies and procedures to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, licensee operators, and agents could take actions that violate these requirements. Violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines and suspension or disqualification from United States federal procurement contracting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u200e\nWe have significant intangible assets, goodwill, and long-term asset balances that may be impaired if cash flows from related activities decline.\nDue to the nature of our business, we have significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill, resulting from events such as the acquisition of businesses and the licensing of content. Our intangible assets are evaluated for impairment based on qualitative factors or upon cash flows and estimated royalties from revenue streams (indefinite-lived intangible assets) if necessary. Our goodwill is evaluated through qualitative factors and by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of our net assets if necessary. Although our current sales, cash flows, and market capitalization are sufficient to support the carrying basis of these long-lived assets, if our sales, cash flows, or common stock price decline, we may be faced with significant asset impairment charges that would have an adverse impact upon our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact our financial results.\nOur most critical accounting estimates are described in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis found in Item 7 of this report under the section entitled \u201cUse of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d In addition, as discussed in various footnotes to our financial statements as found in Item 8, we make certain estimates for loss contingencies, including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. Because, by definition, these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, our actual financial results may differ from these estimates. If our estimates or assumptions underlying such contingencies and reserves prove incorrect, we may be required to record additional adjustments or losses relating to such matters, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results may be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which our suppliers, customers, distribution facilities, offices, and headquarters are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past temporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our customers, vendors and suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, customers, distribution facilities and vendors are located, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties\u2019 computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. Further, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which may affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our vendors, suppliers, and customers. In addition, the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel. Further, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our information technology systems, our ability to serve our customers could be adversely affected. These events could result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation\ncharges or markdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nEnvironmental Issues\nSustainability and protecting our natural environment are significant priorities at Franklin Covey and we strive to implement practices and policies that support this concern. Our current evaluation is that the near term effects of climate change and climate change regulation on our business are not material, but we cannot predict the long-term impacts on us from climate change or its regulation. We will continue to monitor the impacts of such issues on our business and consider responsive action as needed.", "PERMNO": 77637, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "FC"}
