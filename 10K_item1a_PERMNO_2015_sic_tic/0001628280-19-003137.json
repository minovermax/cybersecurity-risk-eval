You should carefully read the following risk factors, together with the financial statements, related notes and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. If any of these risks or uncertainties occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the discussion of \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d on page four of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCompetition could substantially impair our business and our operating results.\nWe compete with companies in the manufacturing of marketing related products, including printed materials, in-store displays, packaging materials, graphics art and digital imaging and fulfillment and logistics. Competition in these industries is intense. Our primary competitors are manufacturers that employ traditional methods of marketing and selling their marketing materials. Some of these manufacturers have larger client bases and significantly more resources than we do. Buyers may prefer to utilize the traditional services offered by the manufacturers with whom we compete. Alternatively, some of these manufacturers may elect to offer outsourced print procurement services or enterprise software applications and their well-established client relationships, industry knowledge, brand recognition, financial and marketing capabilities, technical resources and pricing flexibility may provide them with a competitive advantage over us.\nWe also compete with a number of management firms and brokers. Several of these competitors offer outsourced procurement services or enterprise software applications for the marketing industry. These competitors or new competitors that enter the market may also offer procurement services similar to and competitive with or superior to, our current or proposed offerings and may achieve greater market acceptance. In addition, a software solution and database similar to our proprietary technology could be created over time by a competitor with sufficient financial resources and comparable industry experience. If our competitors are able to offer comparable services, we could lose clients and our market share could decline.\nOur competitors may also establish cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address client needs. Increased competition may lead to revenue reductions, reduced gross margins or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business and our operating results.\nIf our services do not achieve widespread commercial acceptance, our business will suffer.\nMost companies currently coordinate the procurement and management of their marketing materials with their own employees using a combination of telephone, e-mail, their own technology platforms and the Internet. Growth in the demand for our services depends on the adoption of our outsourcing model for marketing related procurement services. We may not be able to persuade prospective clients to change their traditional procurement processes. Our business could suffer if our services are not accepted or are not perceived by the marketplace to be effective or valuable.\nIf our suppliers do not meet our needs or expectations or those of our clients, our business would suffer.\nThe success of our business depends to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality marketing materials and marketing execution services. We do not own manufacturing equipment. Instead, we rely on third-party suppliers to deliver the products and services that we provide to our clients. As a result, we do not directly control the products manufactured or the services provided by our suppliers. If our suppliers do not meet our needs or expectations or those of our clients, our professional reputation may be damaged, our business would be harmed and we could be subject to legal liability.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively limited number of large clients and any loss or decrease in sales to these clients could harm our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively limited number of large clients. Revenue from our top ten clients accounted for 27%, 28%, and 28% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our largest client accounted for 5%, 5%, and 5% of our revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We are likely to continue to\nexperience ongoing client concentration, particularly if we are successful in attracting large clients. Moreover, there may be a loss or reduction in business from one or more of our large clients. It is also possible that revenue from these clients, either individually or as a group, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. The loss or significant reduction of business from our major clients would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant or prolonged economic downturn or a dramatic decline in the demand for marketing materials, could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity and cyclicality in the industries and markets that they serve. Certain of our products are sold to industries, including the advertising, retail, consumer products, housing, financial and pharmaceutical industries, that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on general economic conditions, cyclicality and other factors beyond our control. Continued economic uncertainty or an economic downturn could result in a reduction of the marketing budgets of our clients or a decrease in the number of marketing materials that our clients order from us. Reduced demand from one of these industries or markets could negatively affect our revenues, operating income and profitability.\nA significant decrease in the number of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.\nOur suppliers are not contractually required to continue to accept orders from us. If production capacity at a significant number of our suppliers becomes unavailable, we will be required to use fewer suppliers, which could significantly limit our ability to serve our clients on competitive terms. In addition, we rely on price bids provided by our suppliers to populate our database. If the number of our suppliers decreases significantly, we may not be able to obtain sufficient pricing information for our database, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain favorable pricing for our clients and negatively impact our operating income and profitability.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries in which we have limited operating experience.\nAggregate revenue from outside of the United States represented 32%, 31%, and 33% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We intend to expand our global footprint, which may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate or increasing our operations in countries where we currently have limited operations and resources. Our business outside of the United States is subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and data privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation;\n\u2022\nwars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\ncompliance with and changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements and taxation;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic corruption;\n\u2022\nless developed and less predictable legal systems than those in the United States; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nThe occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may lead to significant legal or compliance expenses and may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region or result in the loss of clients in the affected region or other regions, which could adversely affect our revenue, operating income and profitability.\nAs we expand our business in foreign countries, we will become exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.\nThe European economy continues to experience overall weakness as a result of lingering high unemployment, sovereign debt issues and tightening of government budgets. Continued weak economic conditions in Europe could adversely affect our results of operations in the European countries in which we conduct business. Additionally, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain of the countries that have adopted the Euro currency (the \u201cEuro zone\u201d) and their ability to meet future financial obligations,\nas well as concerns regarding the overall stability of the Euro to function as a single currency among the diverse economic, social and political circumstances within the Euro zone. We conduct a portion of our business in Euro. Although it remains uncertain whether significant changes in the utilization of the Euro will occur or what the potential impact of such changes in the Euro zone or globally might be, a material shift in circulation of the Euro could result in disruptions to our business and negatively impact our results of operations.\nChanges in the United Kingdom's economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect us.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in a national referendum in the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the European Union (\"Brexit\"). In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw, and withdrawal negotiations began in June 2017. European Union rules provide for a two-year negotiation period, ending on March 29, 2019, unless an extension is agreed to by the parties. There remains significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a negotiated and bilaterally approved withdrawal plan. We conduct a portion of our business in both the United Kingdom and the European Union. In 2018, we generated 7.2% of our revenues in the United Kingdom and 8.4% in other countries within the European Union. Our supply chain depends on the free flow of goods in those regions. The ongoing uncertainty and potential re-imposition of border controls and customs duties on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union nations could negatively impact our competitive position, supplier and customer relationships and financial performance. The ultimate effects of Brexit on us will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the United Kingdom and the European Union reach to provide access to each other\u2019s respective markets. If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a bilaterally approved agreement governing the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union, our supply chains for the United Kingdom and the European Union are likely to experience significant disruption and increased costs, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. administrative policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international relations, could adversely affect our financial performance and supply chain economics.\nAs a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, among other possible changes, there may be (i) changes to existing trade agreements; (ii) greater restrictions on free trade generally; and (iii) significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly those manufactured in China, Mexico and Canada. China is currently a leading global source of promotional marketing products, such as branded merchandise and barware, sold in the United States, and Canada supplies a substantial percentage of the pulp and paper used by the U.S. printing industry. In September 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that the current U.S. administration would impose a 10% tariff on approximately $200 billion worth of imports from China into the United States, effective September 24, 2018, which is subject to increase if the United States and China are unable to reach a trade deal. Additionally, in November 2018, the United States, Mexico and Canada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). The USMCA has been ratified by the Mexican Congress. The U.S. Congress is not expected to vote on the agreement until the third quarter of 2019, and approval by the Canadian Parliament is expected to follow United States approval.\nIt remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, will or will not do with respect to tariffs, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently do business or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could adversely affect our supply chain economics, consolidated revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly subjective. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.\nIn addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. The impact of tax reform in the U.S. or other foreign tax law changes could result in an overall tax rate increase to our business.\nIf we are unable to retain and expand the number of our account executives or if a significant number of our account executives leave InnerWorkings, our ability to increase our revenues could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to expand our business will depend largely on our ability to attract and retain account executives with established client relationships. We rely on our core team of approximately 12 lead sales executives to win business from new, large clients. Competition for qualified account executives can be challenging and we may be unable to hire such individuals. Any difficulties we experience in expanding or retaining the number of our account executives could have a negative impact on our ability to expand our client base, increase our revenue and continue our growth.\nIn addition, we must properly incentivize our account executives to obtain new clients and maintain existing client relationships. If a significant number of our account executives leave InnerWorkings and take their clients with them, our revenue could be negatively impacted. Although we have entered into non-competition agreements with our account executives, we may need to litigate to enforce our rights under these agreements, which could be time-consuming, expensive and ineffective. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our current account executives could also increase our recruiting costs and decrease our operating efficiency and productivity, which could lead to a decline in the demand for our services. In addition, if members of our core team of sales executives leave InnerWorkings, our ability to develop new clients and grow our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to expand our client base, our revenue growth rate may be negatively impacted.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we seek to attract new clients and expand relationships with existing clients. If we are unable to attract new clients or expand our relationships with our existing clients, our ability to grow our business will be hindered.\nMost of our clients may terminate their relationships with us on short notice with no or limited penalties.\nMany of our clients use our services on an order-by-order basis rather than under long-term contracts. These clients have no obligation to continue using our services and may stop purchasing from us at any time. We have entered into long-term contracts and contract renewals with many of our clients, which are generally for three to five year initial terms. Most of these contracts, however, permit the clients to terminate our engagements upon prior notice, typically ranging from 90 days to 12 months with limited or no penalties.\nThe volume and type of services we provide our clients may vary from year to year and could be reduced if a client were to change its outsourcing or procurement strategy. If a significant number of our clients elect to terminate or not to renew their engagements with us or if the volume of their orders decreases, our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nWe may not be able to develop or implement new systems, procedures and controls that are required to support the continued growth in our operations.\nOur business continues to grow in size and complexity, and continued growth could place a significant strain on our ability to:\n\u2022\nrecruit, motivate and retain qualified account executives, production managers and management personnel;\n\u2022\npreserve our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment;\n\u2022\ndevelop and improve our internal administrative infrastructure and execution standards; and\n\u2022\nmaintain high levels of client satisfaction.\nTo manage our growth, we must implement and maintain proper operational and financial controls and systems. Further, we will need to manage our relationships with various clients and suppliers. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to develop and implement, on a timely basis, the systems, procedures and controls required to support the growth in our operations or effectively manage our relationships with various clients and suppliers. If we are unable to manage our growth, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, each year we are required to document and test our internal control over\nfinancial reporting; our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we reported that management identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nWe cannot assure that we will not discover other material weaknesses in the future. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in errors to our financial statements and substantial costs and resources may be required to correct and remediate internal control deficiencies and to defend litigation. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business and our business and financial results could deteriorate.\nThe global integration of our technology platform may result in business interruptions.\nWe are currently implementing a common technology platform across our global operations. The implementation of and such changes to our technology platform and related software carry risks such as cost overruns, project delays and business interruptions and delays. If we experience a material business interruption as a result of this process, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may damage client relations and inhibit our growth.\nThe secure and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems is critical to our business. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems, as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other service providers could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, natural or man-made incidents or disasters, or unauthorized physical or electronic access. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including in our industry, and are expected to continue in the future. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our information technology systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our activities and investment may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose access credentials or other sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks. There are no assurances that our actions and investments to improve the maturity of our systems, processes and risk management framework or remediate vulnerabilities will be sufficient or completed quickly enough to prevent or limit the impact of any cyber intrusion. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also dependent on security measures that some of our third-party customers, suppliers and other service providers take to protect their own systems and infrastructures. Some of these third parties store or have access to certain of our sensitive data, as well as confidential information about their own operations, and as such are subject to their own cybersecurity threats.\nAny security breach of any of these third-parties\u2019 systems could result in unauthorized access to our information technology systems, cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nA decrease in levels of excess capacity in the commercial print industry could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe that for the past several years the U.S. commercial print industry has experienced significant levels of excess capacity. Our business seeks to capitalize on imbalances between supply and demand in the print industry by obtaining favorable pricing terms from suppliers in our network with excess capacity. Reduced excess capacity in the print industry generally and in our supplier network specifically, could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our business strategy and on our business results and growth prospects.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property rights may impair our competitive position.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors could replicate our proprietary technology and processes and offer similar services, which would harm our competitive position. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our rights or imitate or duplicate our services and methodologies. We may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. Any such litigation could be time-consuming and costly.\nIf we are unable to maintain our proprietary technology, demand for our services and therefore our revenue could decrease.\nWe rely heavily on our proprietary technology to procure marketing materials for our clients. To keep pace with changing technologies and client demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our technology in response to these trends, which may lead to significant research and development costs. We may be unable to accurately determine the needs of buyers or the trends in the marketing industry or to design and implement the appropriate features and functionality of our technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenue.\nIn addition, we must protect our systems against physical damage from fire, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, physical break-ins and similar events. Any software or hardware damage or failure that causes interruption or an increase in response time of our proprietary technology could reduce client satisfaction and decrease usage of our services.\nIf the key members of our management team do not remain with us in the future, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our current executive team, including Rich Stoddart our Chief Executive Officer, Don Pearson, our Chief Financial Officer, Oren Azar, our General Counsel, Renae Chorzempa, our Chief Human Resources Officer, and Ron Provenzano, our Head of Operations Excellence. The loss of the services of these individuals could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and could divert other senior management time in searching for their replacements.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, effectively integrate newly acquired businesses or achieve expected profitability from acquisitions.\nPart of our growth strategy is to increase our revenue and the markets that we serve through the acquisition of additional businesses. We are actively considering certain acquisitions and will likely consider others in the future. There can be no assurance that suitable candidates for acquisitions can be identified or, if suitable candidates are identified, that acquisitions can be completed on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if suitable candidates are identified, any future acquisitions may entail a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock, including the integration of the acquired operations, diversion of management\u2019s attention, risks of entering markets in which we have limited experience, adverse short-term effects on our reported operating results, the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses and risks associated with unanticipated liabilities.\nWe have used and expect to continue to use, shares of our common stock to pay for all or a portion of our acquisitions. If the owners of potential acquisition candidates are not willing to receive our common stock in exchange for their businesses, our acquisition prospects could be limited. Future acquisitions could also result in accounting charges, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and increased debt and contingent liabilities, including liabilities related to unknown or undisclosed circumstances, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations, which could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to some degree of sales seasonality. Historically, the percentage of our annual revenue earned during the third and fourth fiscal quarters has been higher due, in part, to a greater number of orders for marketing materials in anticipation of the year-end holiday season. If our business continues to experience seasonality, we may incur significant additional expenses\nduring our third and fourth quarters, including additional staffing expenses. Consequently, if we were to experience lower than expected revenue during any future third or fourth quarter, whether from a general decline in economic conditions or other factors beyond our control, our expenses may not be offset, which would have a disproportionate impact on our operating results and financial condition for that year. Such fluctuations in our operating results could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nPrice fluctuations in raw materials costs could adversely affect the margins on our orders.\nOur business relies on a constant supply of various raw materials, including paper and ink. Prices within the print industry are directly affected by the cost of paper, which is purchased in a price sensitive market that has historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Prices are also affected by the cost of ink. Our profit margin and profitability are largely a function of the rates that our suppliers charge us compared to the rates that we charge our clients. If our suppliers increase the price of our orders and we are not able to find suitable or alternative suppliers, our profit margin may decline.\nIf any of our products cause damages or injuries, we may experience product liability claims.\nClients and third parties who claim to suffer damages or an injury caused by our products may bring lawsuits against us. Defending lawsuits arising out of any of the products we provide to our clients could be costly and absorb substantial amounts of management attention, which could adversely affect our financial performance. A significant product liability judgment against us could harm our reputation and business.\nIf any of our key clients fails to pay for our services, our profitability would be negatively impacted.\nIn general, we take full title and risk of loss for the products we procure from our suppliers. Our obligation to pay our suppliers is not contingent upon receipt of payment from our clients. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, our revenue was $1,121.6 million, $1,138.4 million, and $1,094.4 million, respectively, and our top ten clients accounted for 27%, 28%, and 28%, respectively, of such revenue. If any of our key clients fails to pay for our services, our profitability would be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to obtain financing or raise capital in the future may be limited and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. We also expect to refinance our Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined). Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Furthermore, additional equity financing may dilute the interests of our common stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could further restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives and could reduce our profitability. If we are unable to complete the refinancing of our Credit Agreement with a less restrictive leverage ratio, or to obtain additional amendments or waivers, we would likely exceed the maximum leverage ratio covenant within the next twelve months, in which case the lenders would have the ability to demand repayment of the outstanding debt at such time, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Additionally, if we cannot raise or borrow funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered accounting firm\u2019s report on our December 31, 2018 consolidated financial statements contains an emphasis of a matter regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Based on our current operating plan, without the successful refinancing of our debt, we would not be able to meet our covenants beginning in the second quarter of 2019. Although we and our existing lenders have reached agreement to amend our existing revolving credit facility to modify the covenants applicable through the first quarter of 2019, there is no assurance that they would be willing to do so with respect to additional future periods. If we are unable to successfully refinance our debt, and cannot further amend our existing revolving credit facility to modify the covenants for future periods, then our existing lenders would have a right to require repayment of our revolving credit facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIf LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, it may result in higher interest rates, which could result in higher interest expense.\nThe interest rates under our Credit Agreement are calculated using the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). We would expect that any refinanced indebtedness would bear interest on similar terms. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, it may result in higher interest rates. To the extent that these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement initiatives, including our restructuring activities, that reduce our cost structure while driving returns for clients and stockholders.\nAchieving our long-term profitability goals depends significantly on our ability to control or reduce our operating costs. If we are not able to identify and implement initiatives that control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date do not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our efforts to control or reduce costs may include restructuring activities involving workforce reductions, lease and contract terminations and other cost reduction initiatives. Some of the operational improvements we may make to reduce our cost structure are expected to involve significant change management and will require careful management to avoid disrupting client and employee relationships. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits may be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading prices of many small and mid-cap companies are highly volatile. Since our initial public offering in August 2006 through December 31, 2018, the closing sale price of our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market has ranged from a low of $1.92 on March 2, 2009 to a high of $18.69 on October 9, 2007.\nCertain factors may continue to cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and political conditions in the United States or abroad;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive products or services;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our competitors, our clients or our suppliers of significant products or services, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States or foreign countries;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, if the stock market experiences a loss of investor confidence, then the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur quarterly results are difficult to predict and may vary from quarter to quarter, which may result in our failure to meet the expectations of investors and increased volatility of our stock price.\nThe continued use of our services by our clients depends, in part, on the business activity of our clients and our ability to meet their cost saving needs, as well as their own changing business conditions. The time between our payment to the supplier and our receipt of payment from our clients varies with each job and client. In addition, a significant percentage of our revenue is subject to the discretion of our clients, who may stop using our services at any time, subject, in the case of most of our clients, to advance notice\nrequirements. Therefore, the number, size and profitability of jobs may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fall below the expectations of current or potential investors in some future quarters, which could lead to significant variations in the market price of our stock. The factors that are likely to cause these variations include:\n\u2022\nthe demand for our marketing execution solutions;\n\u2022\nthe use of outsourced enterprise solutions;\n\u2022\nclients\u2019 business decisions regarding the quantities of marketing materials they purchase;\n\u2022\nthe number, timing and profitability of our jobs, unanticipated contract terminations and job postponements;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions and enhancements by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage costs, including personnel costs; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to possible acquisitions of other businesses.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends, which may limit the return on your investment.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIf our board of directors authorizes the issuance of preferred stock, holders of our common stock could be diluted and harmed.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to establish the preferred stock\u2019s voting powers, preferences and other rights and qualifications without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power and dividend liquidation rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. It is possible that we may need to raise capital through the sale of preferred stock in the future.", "PERMNO": 91432, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "INWK"}
