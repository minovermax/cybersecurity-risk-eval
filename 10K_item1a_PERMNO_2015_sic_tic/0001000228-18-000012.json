{"cik": "1000228", "company": "HENRY SCHEIN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.\nThe health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and the roles of other distributors. Industry consolidation among health care product distributors, price competition, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition. There has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability. Additionally, in this competitive market, some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments. We could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments. In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability.\nBecause substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.\nWe obtain substantially all of our products from third parties. Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us. Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request. While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, some key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell. Additionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements. The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions. In the event that any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis. There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all. An extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high sales volume product, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.\nOur future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers. If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman. We do not currently have \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nWe experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions. Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters. We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future. Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u2022\ntiming of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;\n\u2022\ntiming of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;\n\u2022\ntiming of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;\n\u2022\nsupplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;\n\u2022\nchanges in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;\n\u2022\ncosts of developing new applications and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;\n\u2022\nunexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;\n\u2022\nexclusivity requirements with certain suppliers, which may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers;\n\u2022\nloss of sales representatives;\n\u2022\ncosts related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;\n\u2022\nour success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;\n\u2022\nunexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;\n\u2022\nproduct demand and availability, or product recalls by manufacturers;\n\u2022\nexposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;\n\u2022\nincreases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nrestructuring costs;\n\u2022\nthe adoption or repeal of legislation;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or regulatory judgments, expenses or settlements.\nAny change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate. If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.\nExpansion of group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPO\u201d) or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. This may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to obtain access to lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts, and to develop relationships with provider networks and new GPOs, we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed.\nIncreases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business.\nShipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe United Kingdom\u2019s vote to leave the European Union (generally referred to as Brexit) and any other similar referenda or actions by other European Union member countries (during 2017, approximately 7% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in the United Kingdom and approximately 25% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in Europe overall, including the U.K.);\n\u2022\nelection results;\n\u2022\nchanges to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without limitation, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other international trade agreements);\n\u2022\ngreater restrictions on imports and exports;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies governing health care;\n\u2022\ntariffs and sanctions;\n\u2022\nsovereign debt levels;\n\u2022\nthe inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence;\n\u2022\nunemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population);\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory and tax regulations; including without limitation, the Tax Cuts and Reform Act;\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates;\n\u2022\navailability of capital;\n\u2022\nincreases in fuel and energy costs;\n\u2022\nthe effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase prices over time;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;\n\u2022\nincreases in health care costs;\n\u2022\nthe threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development and investment in territories and countries where we do business.\nAdditionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall.\nRecessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale. We generally sell products to customers with payment terms. If customers\u2019 cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us. Likewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in our industry and competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in government or legislation;\n\u2022\nour financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;\n\u2022\nstock repurchases;\n\u2022\nany future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, issuances of restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nany outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business.\nIn addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on NASDAQ. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. In recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other things: trends toward managed care; consolidation of health care distribution companies; consolidation of health care manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials. Both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined and, in the case of animal health practitioners, changes in the use of feed additives (including, without limitation, antibiotics and growth promotants) used in the production of animal products due to trade restrictions, animal welfare and/or government regulations; and changes in customer buying habits (including customers purchasing animal health pharmaceuticals outside the veterinarians\u2019 offices). If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe implementation of the Health Care Reform Law could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe Health Care Reform Law significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers.\nThe Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013, and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold. However, with respect to the medical device excise tax, a two-year moratorium was imposed under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017, and on January 22, 2018 an additional two-year moratorium was imposed under Public Law No. 115-120, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2019. The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance. The Health Care\nReform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented. In addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law. Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate. Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the Health Care Law. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions. The tax reform law also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law. The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law also affects our ability to plan.\nAnother notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d), establishes a new payment framework, called the Quality Payment Program, which modifies certain Medicare payments to \u201celigible clinicians,\u201d including physicians, dentists and other practitioners. Under MACRA, eligible clinicians will be required to participate in Medicare through MIPS or APMs. MIPS generally will consolidate three current programs: the physician quality reporting system, the value-based payment modifier, and the Medicare EHR program into a single program in which Medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality, resource use, clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified EHR technology. Advanced APMs generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk. A final rule was published in the Federal Register on November 4, 2016 and allows eligible Medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began January 1, 2017. The data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning January 1, 2019. A final rule updating certain Quality Payment Program regulations was published on November 16, 2017, which is effective as of January 1, 2018. MACRA represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations. The implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace. MACRA may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment, leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base. Although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this.\nThe implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business.\nA Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or Open Payments Program, imposes reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities. Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements, our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us.\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products, and animal feed and supplements. Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act. Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:\n\u2022\nregulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices;\n\u2022\nsubject us to inspection by the FDA and the DEA;\n\u2022\nregulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;\n\u2022\nrequire us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable FDA requirements;\n\u2022\nrequire registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n\u2022\nrequire record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;\n\u2022\nrequire us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA;\n\u2022\nrequire us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities; and\n\u2022\nimpose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.\nApplicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products. Our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad. The FDA and DEA have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities.\nThe failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business. There can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business. The costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material. Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution. If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses. Non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201cfalse claims laws,\u201d prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing-related functionality.\nThe fraud and abuse regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity, over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of \u201crelators,\u201d who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws. Under the federal False Claims Act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries. Also, violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and, in accordance with a final rule published by the Department of Justice on February 3, 2017, which substantially increased the maximum and minimum civil penalties for False Claims Act violations, the amounts for civil penalties assessed after February 3, 2017, whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015, were increased from a minimum per-claim penalty of $10,781 to $10,957, and from a maximum per-claim penalty of $21,563 to $21,916. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties. The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.\nThe United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.\nWe also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the German Anti-Corruption Law and other anti-bribery laws, anti-corruption laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. Our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results, including, without limitation, securities, antitrust and marketing laws and regulations. Failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of non-compliance. We may determine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters. For example, one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software, which resulted in a consent order and fine. Failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices. Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.\nOur businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies. For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as HIPAA. HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOther health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers. Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements. Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted the GDPR, effective from May 25, 2018, which increases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extends the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to Data Subjects or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues. Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data. Among other things, the GDPR requires with respect to data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data. While we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR requirements, our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.\nIn addition, federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes. The initiatives include providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified EHR systems in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements. In addition, Medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified EHR systems and meet \u201cmeaningful use\u201d requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative Medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for applicable health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on January 1, 2015. Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by CMS and ONC. In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria. Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs. CMS and ONC establish criteria for certified EHR systems and these criteria have been subject to change. In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria. If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, as noted above, we are exposed to risk under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the False Claims Act. For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use payments in violation of the False Claims Act. While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality. Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality. Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn October 6, 2015, CMS and ONC released comprehensive final rules with respect to the EHR program that, among other things, established the more challenging \u201cStage 3\u201d criteria, making certain adjustments to Stage 1 and Stage 2 standards (e.g., reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days), and finalized 2015 edition health technology (HIT) certification criteria (which is now added to the existing 2014 edition HIT certification criteria, but not required until 2018). Notably, under the new rules, compliance with Stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017, and would generally be required for all eligible providers (regardless of prior participation in the EHR incentive program) for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently. Developers and others involved in the manufacture of EHR program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products, and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 EHR program period. In connection with the release of the October 6 rules, HHS has also stated it will continue to modify applicable EHR program standards. On November 14, 2016, CMS published a final rule that will impact Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs\nthrough revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals, critical access hospitals, and dual-eligible hospitals.\nThe use of certified EHR technology will continue as a feature of MACRA\u2019s MIPS programs, and in connection with this, Medicare EHR program payment adjustments to eligible professionals will sunset at the end of 2018 and MIPS payment adjustments will begin on January 1, 2019. The first performance period for MIPS began January 1, 2017, and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period, with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting. Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and therefore we must maintain compliance with, and are affected by, these changing governmental criteria.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important. On September 6, 2017, the FDA issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information. As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nThere may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care.\nOur global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business.\nGlobal operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business. The risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing channels of distribution;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nrepatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nanti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records;\n\u2022\nunexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;\n\u2022\nimposition of import/export tariffs, quotas, sanctions or penalties;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nunexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups; and\n\u2022\npublic health emergencies.\nOur expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.\nWe have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future. Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock. Some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:\n\u2022\nmay result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nrequires significant management attention;\n\u2022\nmay place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources; and\n\u2022\nresults in additional acquisition and integration expenses.\nThere can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful. Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following:\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust regulations;\n\u2022\nthe availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of our investments and our ability to raise capital could be affected by the financial credit markets; and\n\u2022\nour ability to retain, recruit and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire.\nOur acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.\nWe are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies. We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions. To effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to manage successfully our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management and financial and operational controls. If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury.\nOur business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products. Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products. As a result, we are subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities. Additionally, as our private-label business continues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims. Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain. In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials. The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability. In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in\nconnection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nOur technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development, technical support and successful marketing.\nCompetition among companies supplying practice management software and/or e-services is intense and increasing. Our future sales of practice management software and e-services will depend on, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\nour ability to enhance our products and services to satisfy customer requirements; and\n\u2022\nour ability to provide ongoing technical support.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market. Our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released. We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur. Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation. We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections. We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products.\nWe rely on third parties for certain technologically advanced products.\nSome of our products contain technologically advanced components, including software, that are developed by third parties. We may not be able to replace the functions provided by these third-party components or products if they become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions, or if they are not adequately maintained or updated.\nIn addition, third-party suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our customers. Alternate sources for the technology currently provided by third parties to us may not be available to us in a timely manner, and may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use or sell.\nFurther, the risk of intellectual property infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our business to include more technologically advanced products and continue to incorporate third party components, software and/or other intellectual property into the products we sell. Also, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. Any infringement action brought against us or our customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.\nThe risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results and our reputation.\nWe may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites.\nTraditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions. The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis. The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time.\nWe rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store data to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;\n\u2022\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nmanage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;\n\u2022\nprocess payments to suppliers; and\n\u2022\nprovide products and services that maintain certain of our customers\u2019 electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of their patients).\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies. In particular, certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers are subject to laws and regulations, such as HIPAA, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.\nRegarding direct customer claims, although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges, or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases.\nIn addition, our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems, and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an IS security breach. Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.\nRisks associated with these and other IS security breaches may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nfuture results could be materially adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;\n\u2022\noperational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities;\n\u2022\nprocedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us;\n\u2022\nwe may incur claims, fines and penalties, and costs for remediation, or substantial defense and settlement expenses; and\n\u2022\nnegative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers.\nWe also deliver Internet-based services and, accordingly, depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the Internet. In the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by Internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing such services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nWe have various insurance policies, including cyber liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. Successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nrequire the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (i) remove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.\nIn addition, our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control. These incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter, and certain other awards made under these incentive plans (such as restricted stock/unit awards) accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control. Further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason, in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions. We are still analyzing the complex new law to determine its impact. In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.", "PERMNO": 82581, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "HSIC"}
