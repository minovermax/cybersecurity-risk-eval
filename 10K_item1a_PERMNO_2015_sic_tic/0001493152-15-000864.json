{"cik": "1135657", "company": "Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a number of risks. You should carefully consider the risks described in \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. You could lose part or all of your investment. You should bear in mind, in reviewing this Form 10-K, that past experience is no indication of future performance. You should read the section titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have limited operating history and only minimum revenues.\nWe have a limited operating history and, accordingly, we are subject to substantial risks inherent in the commencement of a new business enterprise. We are an early stage, technology-driven independent oilfield service company providing well stimulation, coiled tubing and field management services to the upstream oil and gas industry with a focus on improving the ecological and economic aspects of the process. Our Company\u2019s primary focus will be on the most active shale and unconventional oil and natural gas basins outside the United States, commencing with Argentina. To date, we have only generated minimal revenue from our consulting and field management operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully generate additional revenues, or attain operating profitability. Additionally, we have a very limited business history that investors can analyze to aid them in making an informed judgment as to the merits of an investment in our Company. Any investment in our Company should be considered a high-risk investment because the investor will be placing funds at risk in our Company with unforeseen costs, expenses, competition, and other problems to which new ventures are often subjected. Investors should not invest in our Company unless they can afford to lose their entire investment. As we are early in the revenue-generation process, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties encountered in establishing a new business in a highly competitive industry.\nWe have limited sources of liquidity.\nWe require substantial capital to pursue our operating strategy. As we have limited internal sources of liquidity, we will continue to rely on external sources for liquidity for the foreseeable future.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry, and we may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate.\nWe have substantial future capital requirements, including the need to fund growth through acquisition of additional equipment and assets, working capital and capital expenditures and debt service obligations. Since December 2013, our operation and growth has been funded primarily by proceeds from various equity and debt offerings and more recently by cash flows from operations. Our ability to fund operations, and to fund planned and committed 2015 capital expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance, and more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, market conditions in the exploration and production industry and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe we are well-positioned to finance our future growth, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to continue growing our business or to sustain or increase our current level of profitability. Our inability to grow our business may adversely impact our ability to sustain or improve our profits. Moreover, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may not be able to renew our existing agreements on attractive terms or at all, which could adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully fulfill, renew or replace our existing agreements with new agreements on or prior to their expiration on terms satisfactory to us or the operator or that we will be able to continue to provide services under those existing contracts without service interruption. If we are not able to either renew or enter into additional service contracts, the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe are dependent on entering into additional service contracts to grow our business.\nOur customers may choose to integrate their operations vertically by purchasing and operating their own well stimulation fleet, expanding the amount of well stimulation equipment they currently own or using alternative technologies for enhancing oil and gas production.\nOur customers may choose to integrate their operations vertically by purchasing and operating their own well stimulation fleets in lieu of using our well stimulation services. Currently, the availability of attractive financing terms from financial institutions and equipment manufacturers facilitates this possibility by making the purchase of individual well stimulation equipment increasingly affordable to our customers. In addition, there are other technologies available for the artificial enhancement of oil and natural gas production and our customers may elect to use these alternative technologies instead of the well stimulation services we provide. Such vertical integration, increases in vertical integration or use of alternative technologies could result in decreased demand for our well stimulation services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur customer base is concentrated within the oil and natural gas production industry, and loss of a significant customer or the existing customer contracts could cause our revenue to decline substantially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business is and will be highly dependent on existing agreements and the relationships with potential customers and technology partners. Revenues from these potential customers and revenues from joint ventures are expected to represent a substantial portion of our total future revenues. A reduction in business from any of these arrangements resulting from reduced demand for their own products and services, a work stoppage, sourcing of products from other suppliers or other factors could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the inability of suppliers to timely deliver the required equipment for the new well stimulation fleets could have a material adverse impact on our ability to perform under the existing agreements. We expect that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. Our existing agreements do not obligate any of those prospective customers to use our products and services. In addition, the existing agreements contain provisions whereby the customers may terminate the agreement in the event we are unable to perform under the terms of the contract or make adjustments to service and/or materials fees payable thereunder based on changing market conditions. The existing agreements are also subject to termination by customers under certain circumstances, and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have highly sophisticated systems to forecast our future revenue or profitability and therefore could experience difficulty in managing our growth and associated working capital needs.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends on the availability of water.\nWell stimulation, and pressure pumping more generally, can require a significant supply of water, and water supply and quality are important requirements to our operations. We intend to meet our water requirements from sources on or near the well sites, but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of water from sources in these areas, some of which are prone to drought.\nWe may be unable to maintain pricing on our core services.\nPressures stemming from fluctuating market conditions and oil and natural gas prices may make it increasingly difficult to maintain the pricing on our core services. We have faced, and will likely continue to face, pricing pressure from the competitors. If we are unable to maintain pricing on our core services, our financial results will be negatively impacted.\nThe activity level of our customers, spending for our products and services, and payment patterns may be impacted by any deterioration in the credit markets.\nMany of our potential customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. In late 2008 and early 2009, there was a significant decline in the credit markets and the availability of credit, the effects of which may continue to be felt in 2015. Additionally, many of our potential customers\u2019 equity values substantially declined. The combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our potential customers\u2019 spending for our products and services.\nIn addition, the same factors that may lead to a reduction in our potential customers\u2019 spending also may increase the exposure to the risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by the customers. A significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity may result in a decrease in their ability to pay or otherwise perform their obligations to us. Any increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, either as a result of recent changes in financial and economic conditions or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on the operating results and adversely affect the liquidity.\nBecause we rely on a limited number of customers for the well stimulation services, the change in ownership and management of any such customer may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny indebtedness we incur could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nWe anticipate securing growth capital through lease financing or other long-term financing arrangements. Our expected future needs for financing for equipment acquisition and working capital may adversely affect operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on our indebtedness as such payments become due.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways.\nOur convertible note facility contains restrictive covenants. These covenants include, but are not limited to, requirements to reserve shares issuable for payment of the outstanding balance on the convertible note, maintain specific account balances, and comply with the operating budget. Additionally, the covenants include, but are not limited to, restrictions on incurring certain types of additional debt, engaging in transactions with affiliates, selling assets, making unapproved capital expenditures and entering into certain lease agreements.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our note facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our convertible note facility, ACM may accelerate payment under a Convertible Note Facility Agreement (the \u201cNote Agreement\u201d) in accordance with its terms. If we were unable to repay those amounts, ACM could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nWe have pledged a significant portion of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets as collateral under our note facility. If ACM accelerates the repayment of borrowings under our note facility, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay indebtedness under such facilities and our other indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies at competitive prices.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and have relatively few barriers to entry, and the competitive environment has intensified as recent mergers among exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available customers. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate are product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality, reputation for safety and price. We compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Our initial well stimulation fleet currently does not have sufficient HHP to enable us perform the largest well stimulation jobs.\nThe inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring and integrating businesses in the future could adversely affect our operations.\nIf we choose to grow our business through acquisitions or mergers, it is possible that companies acquired or merged into our Company may have internal control weaknesses or risks that were not identified prior to such acquisitions or mergers and such weaknesses or risks could adversely affect us and our operations.\nOur business depends upon our ability to obtain specialized equipment from suppliers and key raw materials on a timely basis.\nIf our current suppliers are unable to provide the necessary raw materials (including, for example, proppant and chemicals) or finished products (such as the new equipment) or otherwise fail to deliver products timely and in quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. During the past few years, our industry faced sporadic proppant shortages associated with pressure pumping operations, requiring work stoppages that adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors.\nThe Chairman of the Board allocates part of his time to other companies.\nMr. Bjarte Bruheim, the chairman of the Board, is also the chairman of the board of directors of other companies and became Chief Executive Officer of one such company in January 2015. Mr. Bruheim allocates his time between the affairs of Eco-Stim and the affairs of these other companies. This situation presents the potential for a conflict of interest for Mr. Bruheim in determining the respective percentages of his time to be devoted to the affairs of Eco-Stim and the affairs of others. In addition, if the affairs of these other companies require him to devote more substantial amounts of his time to the affairs of the other companies in the future, it could limit his ability to devote sufficient time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our business.\nUnexpected equipment malfunctions, catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to decreased revenue and reduce our cash flows.\nAs of the date of this report, our performance is primarily dependent upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our sole pressure pumping fleet, which commenced operation in Argentina in December 2014, and our coiled tubing equipment. If any core equipment experiences unanticipated disruption due to an accident, mechanical failure or other unforeseen event such as a fire, explosion, violent weather conditions or unexpected operational difficulties, or if we have to schedule a temporary shutdown to perform maintenance on any of our core equipment, our ability to provide timely services to our customers could be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption in supply of certain key raw materials could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently anticipate sourcing materials, such as guar gum, from one supplier. Given the limited number of suppliers of such key raw materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements should our suppliers fail to timely deliver these key raw materials. Any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in implementing technology development and enhancements.\nThe market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If we are not able to design, develop and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected and the value of our intellectual property may be reduced. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment and facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nThe management of our Company is important to our success because they have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating the business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, and identifying expansion opportunities. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our management. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the oilfield service industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive. The demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters.\nThe petroleum and oil-service industries in Argentina, where we operate, and other countries are unionized, and it is likely that we may experience work stoppages or other labor disruptions from time to time. At December 31, 2014, approximately 63% of our employees were represented by two labor unions in Argentina and our collective bargaining agreements, both of which expire on March 31, 2015, are currently being renegotiated by the unions. No assurance can be given that the collective bargaining agreements will be successfully extended or renegotiated as they expire from time to time. If any collective bargaining agreement is not extended or renegotiated, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our combined results of operations and financial condition by disrupting our ability to perform well stimulation or pressure pumping and other services for the customers under our service contracts. Moreover, unionization efforts have been made from time to time within the industry, with varying degrees of success. Any such unionization could increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nIf we become subject to warranty and similar claims, they could be time-consuming and costly to defend.\nErrors, defects or other performance problems in the products that we sell or services that we offer could result in our customers seeking damages from us for losses associated with these errors, defects or other performance problems.\nOur business involves certain operating risks and our insurance coverage or proceeds, if any, may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations.\nThe technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks. Our services involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments. An accident involving our services or equipment, or a failure of a product, could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations. Our insurance policies may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nGeopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we do business. Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our ability to conduct our operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, (\u201cNOLs\u201d), and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may have previously experienced, and may in the future experience, one or more \u201cownership changes,\u201d including in connection with this public offering. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Argentina and Other Foreign Jurisdictions\nOur business is largely dependent upon economic conditions in Argentina.\nSubstantially all of our initial operations and customers are located in Argentina, and, as a result, our business is to a large extent dependent upon economic conditions prevailing in Argentina. The Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in past decades, including numerous periods of low or negative growth and high and variable levels of inflation and devaluation. Argentina\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an average annual real rate of approximately 8.5% from 2003 to 2008, although the growth rate decelerated to 0.9% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but recovered in 2010 and 2011, growing at an annual real rate of approximately 9%, according to preliminary official data. In 2013, the Argentine economy grew at a rate of 3% on an annualized basis compared to 1.9% in 2012. No assurances can be given that the rate of growth experienced over past years will be achieved in subsequent years or that the economy will not contract. If economic conditions in Argentina were to slow, or contract, or if the Argentine government\u2019s measures to attract or retain foreign investment and international financing in the future are unsuccessful, such developments could adversely affect Argentina\u2019s economic growth and in turn affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nArgentine economic results are dependent on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\u25cf international demand for Argentina\u2019s principal exports;\n\u25cf international prices for Argentina\u2019s principal commodity exports;\n\u25cf stability and competitiveness of the Argentine Peso against foreign currencies;\n\u25cf levels of consumer consumption and foreign and domestic investment and financing; and\n\u25cf the rate of inflation.\nIn recent years, Argentina has confronted inflationary pressure. According to inflation data published by the National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos, INDEC), from 2008 to 2012, the Argentine consumer price index increased 7.2%, 7.7%, 10.9%, 9.5% and 10.8%, respectively; the wholesale price index increased 8.8%, 10.3%, 14.5%, 12.7% and 13.1%, respectively. However, certain private sector analysts usually quoted by the government opposition, based on methodologies being questioned by the Argentine government on the basis of the lack of technical support, believe that actual inflation is significantly higher than that reflected in INDEC reports. Increased rates of inflation in Argentina could increase our cost of operation, and may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that inflation rates will not be higher in the future.\nIn addition, Argentina\u2019s economy is vulnerable to adverse developments affecting its principal trading partners. A significant decline in the economic growth of any of Argentina\u2019s major trading partners, such as Brazil, China or the United States, could have a material adverse impact on Argentina\u2019s balance of trade and adversely affect Argentina\u2019s economic growth and may consequently adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2005, Argentina restructured a substantial portion of its bond indebtedness and settled all of its debt with the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, in June 2010, Argentina completed the renegotiation of approximately 67% of defaulted bonds that were not swapped in 2005. As a result of the 2005 and 2010 debt swaps, approximately 91% of the country\u2019s bond indebtedness on which Argentina defaulted in 2002 has now been restructured. However, certain \u201choldout\u201d creditors did not agree to the restructuring, and commenced litigation in the United States in an effort to prevent payment under the terms of the restructuring.\nOn November 21, 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an injunction preventing Argentina from making payments on the restructured bonds, and ordered Argentina to make a deposit of USD$1,330 million related to the claims of the holdout creditors, which order was appealed by the country. Argentina\u2019s appeal was denied by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and on June 16, 2014 the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear Argentina\u2019s appeal from that denial. As a result, it is widely believed that Argentina may default on its restructured debt unless it is able to settle the claims of the plaintiffs in the New York litigation in a manner that will allow payment to be made in accordance with the restructuring.\nArgentina\u2019s failure to restructure completely its remaining sovereign debt and settle with the holdout creditors may prevent Argentina from obtaining favorable terms or interest rates when accessing the international capital markets. Litigation initiated by holdout creditors or other parties may result in material judgments against the Argentine government and could result in attachments of or injunctions relating to assets of Argentina, which could have a material adverse effect on the country\u2019s economy, resulting among other things in further devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and may also affect our customers\u2019 access to international financing.\nIn addition, the Argentine Peso has been subject to significant devaluation in the past and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future, consequently affecting our financial condition and results of operations (see additionally - \u201cWe may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates\u201d).\nCertain risks are inherent in any investment in a company operating in an emerging market such as Argentina.\nArgentina is an emerging market economy, and investing in emerging markets generally carries risks. These risks include political, social and economic instability that may affect Argentina\u2019s economic results which can stem from many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf high interest rates;\n\u25cf abrupt changes in currency values;\n\u25cf high levels of inflation;\n\u25cf exchange controls;\n\u25cf wage and price controls;\n\u25cf regulations to import equipment and other necessities relevant for operations;\n\u25cf changes in governmental economic or tax policies; and\n\u25cf political and social tensions.\nAny of these factors, as well as volatility in the capital markets, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or the liquidity, trading markets and value of our securities.\nThe Argentine economy has been adversely affected by economic developments in other markets.\nFinancial and securities markets in Argentina, and also the Argentine economy, are influenced by economic and market conditions in other markets worldwide. Considering the current international turmoil, Argentina\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including those relating to or similar to the global economic crisis that began in 2008 and the recent uncertainties surrounding European sovereign debt. For example, the recent challenges faced by the European Union to stabilize some of its member economies, such as Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have had international implications affecting the stability of global financial markets, which has hindered economies worldwide. Many member nations in the European Union are addressing the issues with controversial austerity measures. Should the European Union monetary policy measures be insufficient to restore confidence and stability to the financial markets, any recovery of the global economy, including the United States and European Union economies, could be hindered or reversed, which could negatively affect our business. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors\u2019 perceptions of events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and investments in securities from issuers in other countries, including Argentina.\nConsequently, there can be no assurance that the Argentine financial system and securities markets will not continue to be adversely affected by events in developed countries\u2019 economies or events in other emerging markets, which could in turn, adversely affect the Argentine economy and, as a consequence, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe implementation of new export duties, other taxes and import regulations could adversely affect our results.\nIn 2012, the Argentine government adopted an import procedure pursuant to which local authorities must pre-approve any import of products and services to Argentina as a precondition to allow importers access to the foreign exchange market for the payment of such imported products and services.\nWe cannot assure you that these taxes and import regulations will not continue or be increased in the future or that other new taxes or import regulations will not be imposed.\nWe may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nOur results of operations are exposed to currency fluctuation and any devaluation of the Argentine Peso against the U.S. dollar and other hard currencies may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The value of the Argentine Peso has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future. We are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, the value of the Argentine Peso may further depreciate or appreciate against the U.S. dollar and how any such fluctuations would affect our business.\nWe are subject to exchange and capital controls.\nIn the past, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. Beginning in 2011, additional foreign exchange restrictions have been imposed which restrict purchases of foreign currency and transfers of foreign currency abroad. Such restrictions include the requirement for financial institutions to inform in advance and obtain approval from the Argentine Central Bank with respect to any foreign exchange transaction to be entered into through the foreign exchange market with the exception of payments related to foreign debt previously liquidated in the domestic market. Since 2011, oil and gas companies, among other entities, were required to repatriate 100% of their foreign currency export receivables.\nThere can be no assurances regarding future modifications to exchange and capital controls. Exchange and capital controls could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations and execute our financing plans.\nOperating internationally subjects us to significant risks and regulations inherent in operating in foreign countries.\nWe plan to conduct operations in a number of countries. Our international operations will be subject to a number of risks inherent to any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those with emerging markets, including the following risks, among others:\n\u25cf government instability, which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential clients to be withdrawn or delayed, reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u25cf potential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets, such as the nationalization of Repsol S.A.\u2019s interest in YPF;\n\u25cf difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; import/export tariffs and quotas;\n\u25cf civil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u25cf availability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy that limit the importation of qualified crewmembers or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient;\n\u25cf decrees, laws, regulations, interpretation and court decisions under legal systems, which are not always fully developed and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs; and\n\u25cf terrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel.\nWe cannot predict the nature and the likelihood of any such events. However, if any of these or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nCertain of the equipment that we use in certain foreign countries may require prior U.S. government approval in the form of an export license and may otherwise be subject to tariffs and import/export restrictions. The delay in obtaining required governmental approvals could affect our ability to timely commence a project, and the failure to comply with all such controls could result in fines and other penalties.\nWe may be subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns will be subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as an international company depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nOur international operations involve the use of foreign currencies, which subjects us to exchange rate fluctuations, difficulty in repatriating foreign currencies and other currency risks.\nWe and our foreign subsidiaries from time to time will hold foreign currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations will subject us to currency risk as well as to other risks sometimes associated with international operations. In the future, we could experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the United States, and there can be no assurance that payments received in foreign currencies can be repatriated to the United States or that we will be able, contractually or otherwise, to reduce the currency risks associated with our international operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making, offering or authorizing improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries or regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.\nAs a company subject to compliance with the FCPA, our business may suffer and we may be subject to competitive disadvantages because our efforts to comply with U.S. laws could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to U.S. law. Additionally, our business plan involves establishing close relationships with stakeholders in certain foreign markets. Any determination that we or foreign shareholders, directors, or officers partners have violated the FCPA may adversely affect our business and operations.\nViolations of anti-bribery laws (either due to our acts or our inadvertence) may result in criminal and civil sanctions and could subject us to other liabilities in the United States and elsewhere. Even allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nWe may face intense competition in our industry and in the markets where we operate.\nThe industry in which we compete is highly competitive, and most of our potential competitors will have greater financial resources than we do. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive services or substantially decrease the prices at which they offer their services, we may be unable to compete effectively. Some of these competitors may expand or construct newer, more powerful or more flexible well stimulation fleets that would create additional competition for us. Furthermore, recent reduction in drilling activity in markets such as the United States may drive other oilfield services companies to relocate their equipment to the regions we operate or intend to operate in. Such increase in supply relative to demand could negatively impact pricing and utilization of our services. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter markets served or proposed to be served by us, that we will be able to compete successfully, or that we will have adequate funds to compete.\nBecause the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, our operating results may fluctuate.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Fluctuations in such prices may result in a decrease in the expenditure levels of oil and natural gas companies and drilling contractors, which in turn may adversely affect us. For example, the decrease in commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 will likely result in a decrease in our shale oil and gas customer\u2019s profitability, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory compliance costs and restrictions, as well as delays in obtaining permits by the customers for their operations, such as for well stimulation and pressure pumping, or by us for our operations, could impair our business.\nOur operations and the operations of the customers are subject to or impacted by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions in which the operations are located. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including well stimulation, our operations or the operations of our customers could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. The high cost of compliance with applicable regulations may cause customers to discontinue or limit their operations, and may discourage companies from continuing development activities. As a result, demand for our services could be substantially affected by regulations adversely impacting the oil and natural gas industry.\nDemand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;\n\u25cf the price and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions in or affecting other producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u25cf the ability of members of the Organizational of Petroleum Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf the level of global exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf the level of global inventories;\n\u25cf prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate;\n\u25cf the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u25cf localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u25cf the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\n\u25cf weather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf expectations about future commodity prices; and\n\u25cf domestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry, such as the recent decrease in commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2014, could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to hazards and environmental risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry.\nWe are a provider of well stimulation and pressure pumping services, a process involving the injection of fluids-typically consisting mostly of water and also including several chemical additives-as well as sand in order to create fractures extending from the well bore through the rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily through the rock pores to a production well. In addition, we provide a range of services to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production operations, consisting of, among other things, coiled tubing services. Risks inherent to our industry create the potential for significant losses associated with damage to the environment or natural resources, such as the potential for contamination of drinking water resources.\nNew technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. If competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future that are more efficient or productive than ours, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe industry is affected by excess equipment inventory levels.\nBecause of the long-life nature of oil field service equipment and the lag between when a decision to build additional equipment is made and when the equipment is placed into service, the inventory of oilfield service equipment in the industry does not always correlate with the level of demand for service equipment.\nCurrent and potential legislative, regulatory and enforcement initiatives could materially increase our operating costs and/or adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives and to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, well stimulation and pressure pumping, water discharges, wetlands or land use practices, waste management, and the release of hazardous substances into the environment. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. In addition, these laws may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our or our customers\u2019 operations in affected areas.\nCurrent or future legislation, regulations and development may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations.\nCompliance with governmental regulations may impact our or our customers\u2019 operations and may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur operations are dependent on our customers\u2019 decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and well stimulation and pressure pumping, improve total recovery, but they also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulations in the future.\nAccess to prospects is also important to our customers and such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect. Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced. This could lead our customers to curtail their operations and result in a decrease in demand for our services, which in turn could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAny of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives relating to well stimulation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our operations or the operations of our customers.\nMany national, provincial, and local governments and agencies have adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using well stimulation, which is part of the overall services we provide to our customers. Well stimulation is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. In response to concerns related to potential impacts to the environment and natural resources from well stimulation, governmental authorities have issued new rules and regulations governing the practice, and are also pursuing studies related to its potential effects. Also, some national, state, and local governments have adopted bans or other measures restricting well stimulation activities. For example, the Province of Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina, where we operate, has approved a set of rules regarding the extraction of shale oil and gas. These rules require, amongst other things, that operators performing well stimulation obtain permits prior to commencing drilling activities and file reports with the provincial government regarding the chemicals used in the well stimulation process and an analysis of the flowback water returning to the surface. In addition, several other provinces and local governments have voted to ban well stimulation within their borders, and some groups continue to advocate for a national ban on well stimulation in Argentina.\nFuture well stimulation-related legislation or regulations that further restrict or prohibit such activities could lead to operational delays and increased costs for our operations or the operations of our customers. Any adverse impacts on the operations of our customers could in turn reduce demand for our services. If such additional legislation or regulations are enacted and implemented, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with climate change legislation or initiatives could negatively impact our business.\nInternational, national, and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions in response to concerns that GHGs contribute to climate change. For example, in the United States, the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA\u2019s \u201cMandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases\u201d rule established in 2010 provided a comprehensive national scheme of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions, including emissions from the oil and gas industry.\nInternational developments focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide and other gases include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the \u201cCopenhagen Accord\u201d (an internationally applied protocol, which has been ratified by several countries in Latin America and is a continuation of the Kyoto Protocol) and the European Union\u2019s Emission Trading System. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico have all committed to reducing GHG emissions, either through the deployment of renewable energy sources or through the use of a cap and trade program. Such programs place a cap on GHG emissions at certain sources and require those sources to purchase allowances for emissions above their cap. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. In addition, current or future legislation, regulations and developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change or severe weather could adversely affect our operations.\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand for the oil and gas produced by our customers. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Extreme winter conditions may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue. In addition, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs and risks as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with some, but not all of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC. Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of SOX and rules adopted by the SEC, have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs to us as we respond to these requirements. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is uncertain. If our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively, we may not be able to issue an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required or we or our independent registered public accounting firm may determine that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. In addition, our registered public accounting firm may either disclaim an opinion as it relates to management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls or may issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our ability to run our business as we otherwise would like to. New rules could also make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, our Board committees, and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the total amount of the costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with these rules and regulations.\nCompliance with Section 404 of the SOX will continue to strain our limited financial and management resources.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our status as a reporting public company. SOX and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. As such, our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, SOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure of controls and procedures. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 of SOX requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. In addition, the terms of our senior credit facility prohibit us from paying dividends and making other distributions. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently have a sporadic, illiquid, volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock may remain sporadic, illiquid, and volatile in the future.\nWe currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the future and will likely be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf our ability or inability to generate revenues;\n\u25cf the number of shares in our public float;\n\u25cf increased competition; and\n\u25cf conditions and trends in the market for oil and gas and down-hole services.\nFurthermore, because our common stock is currently traded on OTCQB, and because we have applied to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Shareholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise caution before making an investment in our Company, and should not rely on the publicly quoted or traded stock prices in determining our common stock value, but should instead determine the value of our common stock based on the information contained in our public reports, industry information, and those business valuation methods commonly used to value private companies.\nACM may have significant influence over us, including influence over decisions that require stockholder approval, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nThe Note Agreement allows us to issue to ACM a multiple draw secured promissory note (the \u201cConvertible Note\u201d) with a maximum aggregate principal amount of $22 million, convertible into our common stock at a price of $6.00 per share. We have drawn down the full amount of the commitments available under our note facility. If ACM elects to convert all of the principal on the Convertible Note, it will hold up to approximately 48% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, pursuant to a stockholder rights agreement (the \u201cStockholder Rights Agreement\u201d) entered into by and among the Company, ACM and certain management stockholders (the \u201cManagement Stockholders\u201d), ACM currently has the right to nominate at least one individual for election to the Board for so long as ACM beneficially owns greater than 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis), and currently has the right to nominate up to a total of three individuals to the Board as a result of the full exercise of its option to purchase an aggregate of 1,333,333 shares of our common stock at a price of $6.00 per share (the \u201cOption\u201d) in accordance with a Securities Purchase Option Agreement entered into on May 28, 2014 between the Company and ACM (the \u201cOption Agreement\u201d). As a result, ACM has influence over our decisions to certain corporate actions including those specified in the Stockholder Rights Agreement.\nMoreover, ACM has a contractual right to maintain its percentage ownership in our Company. Specifically, under the terms of the Stockholder Rights Agreement, for so long as ACM beneficially owns more than 15% of our issued and outstanding common stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis), ACM, subject to certain exclusions, has a preemptive right to purchase up to 40% of any new securities we propose to issue or sell. As a result, ACM\u2019s preemptive right will apply to any securities we issue during an underwritten public offering on terms and conditions (including pricing terms) substantially similar to those offered by the underwriters. Therefore, while other holders of our stock would risk suffering a reduction in percentage ownership in connection with a new issuance of securities by us, ACM would, through this preemptive right, have the opportunity to avoid a reduction in percentage ownership. As long as ACM continues to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, it will have the ability to influence the vote in any election of directors and over decisions that require stockholder approval.
