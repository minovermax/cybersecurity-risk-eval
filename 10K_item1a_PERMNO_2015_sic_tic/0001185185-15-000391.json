{"cik": "1171012", "company": "Uni-Pixel", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are certain risks and uncertainties relating to our business.\nYou should carefully consider the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business financial condition, operating results and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a company with a limited operating history, our future profitability is uncertain and we anticipate future losses and negative cash flow, which may limit or delay our ability to become profitable.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history and no significant revenues to date. To date, we have had only a few revenue-generating services and development contracts. We expect to expend significant resources on consultants, intellectual property protection, research and development, advertising, hiring of personnel and startup costs. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to generate ongoing revenue, and we may never be able to produce material revenues or operate on a profitable basis. As a result, we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to experience operating losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated total deficit of $112.2 million.\nWe anticipate our losses will continue to increase from current levels because we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to prototype development, consulting costs, laboratory development costs, marketing and other promotional activities, the addition of engineering and manufacturing personnel, and the continued development of relationships with strategic business partners. Moreover, planned products based upon our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology may never become commercially viable and thus may never generate any revenues. Even if we find commercially viable applications for our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials, we may never recover our research and development expenses.\nWe are the subject of an SEC investigation. Any final resolution of this matter could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nOn November 19, 2013, we learned that the Fort Worth Regional Office of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) issued subpoenas concerning our agreements relating to the InTouch Sensors. We are unable to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the SEC or its staff as a result of the matters that are the subject of the subpoenas or what impact, if any, the cost of responding to the subpoenas might ultimately have on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We have not established any provision for losses in respect of this matter. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of the SEC investigation will not result in administrative, civil or other proceedings or sanctions against us or our employees by the SEC or any other state or federal regulatory agencies. Such proceedings may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, actions against us or our employees, modifications to business practices and compliance programs or the imposition of sanctions against us. Protracted investigations could also impose substantial costs and distractions, regardless of the outcome. There can be no assurance that any final resolution of this and any similar matters will not have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nNegative press from the SEC investigation and stockholder litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe negative press resulting from the SEC investigation and stockholder litigation matters may have harmed our reputation and could otherwise result in a loss of future business. It could also adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with us. As a result, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nCurrent worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe United States economy may experience a financial downturn, with some financial and economic analysts predicting that the world economy may be entering into a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment, limited availability of credit, increased rates of default and bankruptcy, and decreased consumer and business spending. These developments could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending with us or may not pay us, or may delay paying us for previously purchased products. In addition, this downturn has had, and may continue to have, an unprecedented negative impact on the global credit markets. Credit has tightened significantly in the last several years, resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to borrowers, and in many cases, the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. If this crisis continues or worsens, and if we are required to obtain financing in the near term to meet our working capital or other business needs, we may not be able to obtain that financing. Further, even if we are able to obtain the financing we need, it may be on terms that are not favorable to us, with increased financing costs and restrictive covenants.\nWe may be unsuccessful in gaining recognition for our brand name and technology in the marketplace. If we cannot effectively promote our brand and technology, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nOur brand name and technology are new and unproven. In order to gain brand recognition and provide adequate exposure of our technology in the marketplace, we may be required to increase our marketing and advertising budgets. However, we may not be able to maintain an advertising budget that is sufficient to create and maintain brand loyalty and market exposure. If we are unable to effectively develop and timely promote our brand and technology and establish a leading position in our marketplace, our results of operations and financial condition will suffer.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology, which would allow our competitors to take advantage of our research and development efforts.\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive processes and products. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality and security procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology, products and processes. If we fail to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or from third parties infringing our patents or misappropriating our trade secrets or provide us with any competitive advantage. In addition, effective patent and other intellectual property protection may be unenforceable or limited in foreign countries. If a third party initiates litigation regarding the validity of our patents, and is successful, a court could revoke our patents or limit the scope of coverage for those patents.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. We protect this information with reasonable security measures, including the use of confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with strategic partners. It is possible that these agreements may not be sufficient or that these individuals or companies may breach these agreements and that any remedies for a breach will be insufficient to allow us to recover our costs and damages. Furthermore, our trade secrets, know-how and other technology may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.\nIf we fail to enter cooperative research agreements, we might not succeed in commercializing our technology and materials.\nResearch and development of commercially viable applications for our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials may at some point depend substantially on the success of the work conducted by and with our present and future research partners. We cannot be certain that these research partners will make the additional advances in these technologies and materials that may be essential to successfully commercialize our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials. Moreover, although we fund Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology research, the scope and technical aspects of this research and the resources and efforts directed to this research currently are and may remain in large part subject to the control of our research partners.\nIf we cannot form and maintain lasting business relationships with targeted partners, our business strategy could suffer or fail.\nOur business strategy includes some dependence upon developing and maintaining commercial licensing and material supply relationships. All of our current relationship discussions with product manufacturers are limited to technology exploration and the evaluation of our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials for possible use in commercial applications. Some or all of these relationships may not succeed or, even if they are successful, may not result in the manufacturers\u2019 entering into commercial licensing and material supply relationships with us.\nUnder our planned technology development and evaluation agreements, we intend to work with strategic partners to incorporate our technologies into their products. However, many of these technology development and evaluation agreements may last for limited periods of time, such that our relationships with these partners could end unless the agreements are renewed. Our partners may not agree to renew their relationships with us on a continuing basis, or may do so on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, we may continue working with certain strategic partners in evaluating our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials after our existing agreements with them have expired while we are attempting to negotiate contract extensions or new agreements with them. Should our relationships with these partners not materialize, or once in place, not continue to be renewed, our business could suffer.\nOur ability to enter into commercial licensing and material supply relationships, or to maintain our existing technology development and evaluation relationships, may require us to make financial or other commitments. We might not be able, for financial or other reasons, to enter into or continue these relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to do so will likely harm our business strategy, operating results and long-term business prospects.\nOur potential for rapid growth and our entry into new markets make it difficult for us to evaluate our current and future business prospects, and we may be unable to effectively manage any growth associated with these new markets, which may increase the risk of your investment and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur recent development of the Copperhead\u2122 process enables us to enter a large and growing market for transparent touch screens. We believe this technology is a superior replacement to indium tin oxide (ITO) as the transparent conducting layer in a touch screen device. Because this Copperhead\u2122 process is relatively new and we have recently entered new markets in connection therewith, we may be unable to evaluate its relative success and future prospects, particularly in light of our goals to continually grow our existing and new customer base, expand our product offerings, integrate complementary businesses and enter additional new markets.\nIn addition, our potential growth, recent product introductions and entry into new markets may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our executive management, personnel and systems, and our operational, administrative and financial resources may be inadequate. We may also not be able to effectively manage any expanded operations, or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis, particularly if the number of customers using our products and services significantly increases or their demands and needs change as our business expands. If we are unable to manage expanded operations effectively, we may experience operating inefficiencies, the quality of our products and services could deteriorate, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we do not receive additional financing when and as needed in the future, we may not be able to continue the research, development and commercialization of our technology and materials.\nOur capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant. In the future, we will likely require substantial additional funds in excess of our current financial resources for research, development and commercialization of our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials, to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. Our cash on hand will likely not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs. When and as we need additional funds, such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain additional funding when and as needed, our business might fail. Additionally, if we attempt to raise funds in a future offering of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants or convertible promissory notes, or if we engage in acquisitions involving the issuance of such securities, the issuance of these securities could dilute the ownership of our then-existing stockholders.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nA third party may sue us or one of our strategic collaborators for infringing its intellectual property rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our patent rights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party intellectual property rights.\nThe cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our time away from our business operations. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we or our strategic collaborators may be required to pay monetary damages; stop commercial activities relating to the affected products or services; obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products or services; or attempt to compete in the market with a substantially similar product.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue some of our operations. In addition, a court may require that we pay expenses or damages, and litigation could disrupt our commercial activities.\nIf we are unable to keep up with rapid technological changes, our processes, products or services may become obsolete.\nThe touch enabled device market is characterized by significant and rapid technological change. Although we will continue to expand our technological capabilities in order to remain competitive, research and discoveries by others may make our processes, products or services less attractive or even obsolete.\nOur efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials for broad-based product applications.\nOur research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies, including without limitation unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot complete, or if we experience significant delays in completing, research and development of our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources, and it may be difficult to compete against them.\nThe touch enabled device industry is characterized by intense competition. Many of our competitors have better name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, personnel and/or research capabilities than we do. They have made and continue to make substantial investments in improving their technologies and manufacturing processes. In addition, we believe that at times in the past certain plasma and LCD display panel manufacturers have priced their products below the marginal cost of production in an attempt to establish, retain or increase market share. Because of these circumstances, it may be difficult to compete successfully in the display market.\nThe loss of the services of our key management and personnel or the failure to attract additional key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nA loss of one or more of our current officers or key employees could severely and negatively impact our operations. Specifically, the loss of services of Jeff A. Hawthorne, CEO and President, whom does not have an employment agreement with us, could significantly harm our business. We have no present intention of obtaining key-man life insurance on any of our executive officers or management. Additionally, competition for highly skilled technical, managerial and other personnel is intense. As our business develops, we might not be able to attract, hire, train, retain and motivate the highly skilled managers and employees we need to be successful. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel, our business will suffer and might fail.\nThe touch enabled device industry has historically experienced significant downturns, which may adversely affect the demand for and pricing of our technology and materials.\nThe touch enabled device industry has experienced significant periodic downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity and erosion of average selling prices. Industry-wide fluctuations and downturns in the demand for touch enabled devices would likely affect the demand for and pricing of our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technologies and materials and could cause significant harm to our business.\nThe reliability of market data included in our public filings is uncertain.\nSince we operate in a rapidly changing market, we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, include market data from industry publications and our own internal estimates in some of the documents we file with the SEC. This data may be inaccurate, incomplete or unreliable. Industry publications generally state that the information contained in these publications has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that its accuracy and completeness is not guaranteed. Although we believe that the market data used in our filings with the SEC is and will be reliable, it has not been and will not be independently verified. Similarly, internal company estimates, while believed by us to be reliable, have not been and will not be verified by any independent sources.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility, which substantially increases the risk of loss to persons owning our common stock.\nOur common stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board at prices as low as $2.25 and as high as $22.50 during a period from January 1, 2008 through December 9, 2010. Our common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market as low as $3.98 and as high at $41.42 during the period from December 10, 2010 through December 31, 2014. In addition, the markets for high technology stocks have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of shares our common stock.\nThe value of an investment in our common stock could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock:\n\u00b7\nDisappointing results from our development efforts;\n\u00b7\nFailure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u00b7\nDecline in demand for our common stock;\n\u00b7\nDownward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u00b7\nTechnological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u00b7\nInvestor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic trends;\n\u00b7\nVariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nOur inability to increase revenues:\n\u00b7\nAnnouncement of new customer relationships by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nDepartures of our executive officers;\n\u00b7\nGeneral conditions in the economy, including fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nDevelopments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u00b7\nDevelopments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7\nAny significant acts of terrorism against the United States; and\n\u00b7\nOur currently limited public float.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options, and future sales of the underlying shares of common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding warrants and options exercisable for an aggregate of 2,351,803 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $9.45 per share. The holders may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time, without limitations on the timing, amount or method of sale. As our stock price rises, the holders may exercise their warrants and options and sell a large number of shares. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our existing stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock and our business.\nWe may require additional financing to fund future operations, including expansion in current and new markets, development and acquisition, capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price and the voting power of shares of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nThere is no guarantee that our shares will continue to be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nWe may not be able to meet the requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, or there may not be enough brokers interested in making a market for our stock to allow us to continue to list thereon. Therefore, it may be difficult to sell your shares of common stock if you desire or need to sell them.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement (which disappears after one year). Affiliates may sell after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information and notice requirements. Of the 12,350,715 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014, approximately 12.2 million shares are held by non- \u201caffiliates\u201d and are, or will be, freely tradable without restriction, and the remaining shares are held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d, as of such date. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus (including sales by investors of securities acquired in connection with this offering) may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our shares of common stock, and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to develop and expand our business operations.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. These provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n\u00b7\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12496, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "UNXLQ"}
