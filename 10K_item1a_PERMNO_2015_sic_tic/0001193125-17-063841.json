{"cik": "800240", "company": "OFFICE DEPOT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and our Company could materially impact our future performance and results. We have provided below a list of risk factors that should be reviewed when considering investing in our securities.\nRisks Related to the Staples Acquisition\nThe terminated Staples Acquisition has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe pendency of the Staples Acquisition of our company contributed to uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which had an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we allocated significant management resources towards the completion of the transaction. The Staples Merger Agreement was terminated on May 10, 2016 and Staples paid a termination fee to the Company, as required under that Agreement. However, the Company may continue to experience loss of customers, suppliers and employees as a result of that failed merger and attempts to add new customers, suppliers and employees could also be adversely affected. The impact of this terminated transaction could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur ongoing business is subject to certain risks related to our merger with OfficeMax and other restructuring activities.\nWe completed a merger with OfficeMax on November 5, 2013, pursuant to which OfficeMax became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company. The Merger involved the integration of two companies that previously operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations. We have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating the companies. The combined company is expected to capture more than $750 million in synergy benefits when the integration is fully implemented. We anticipate completing substantially all of the integration activities by the end of 2017.\nAdditionally, in response to economic and competitive factors in our industry, we may, from time to time, undertake certain restructuring activities within our business divisions to improve our performance. During 2016, we announced the Comprehensive Business Review that, among other things, included the anticipated closure of 300 retail stores over the next three years and certain planned restructuring activity to lower operating costs. During the first quarter of 2017, we implemented the Corporate restructuring portion of the plan. Also as part of the Comprehensive Business Review we decided to pursue strategic alternatives for our international businesses and in the third quarter 2016, committed to a plan to sell substantially all of the business formerly reported as the International Division.\nWe may not be able to fully achieve the expected Merger synergies or restructuring benefits due to certain risks, among other things, risks that:\n\u2022\nthe continued integration of the businesses of Office Depot and OfficeMax may take longer, be more difficult, time-consuming or costly to accomplish than expected;\n\u2022\nwe may experience business disruption during periods of restructuring activities, including adverse effects on employee retention and loss of employee focus during periods of restructuring activities;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to avoid potential liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the Merger integration or other restructuring activities, including those under the Comprehensive Business Review;\n\u2022\nthere may be unanticipated changes in the markets for the combined Company\u2019s business segments;\n\u2022\nbranding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to close all of the stores targeted for closure or such store closures may not result in the benefits or cost savings at levels that we anticipate due to factors such as sales transfers to stores remaining open being below our projections and costs to close stores being higher than our projections, because of the terms of the existing lease, the condition of the local property market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord, the availability of potential sub-lease tenants and employee severance and other costs;\n\u2022\nThe decline in purchasing power from reduced sales, store closures and business dispositions may impact our relationships with vendors. We may not be able to receive volume discounts similar to past periods, obtain favorable product selection and availability, negotiate with landlords for favorable lease terms and other variable costs of doing business may be adversely impacted;\n\u2022\nthere may be unanticipated downturns in business relationships with customers;\n\u2022\nthere may be competitive pressures on the combined Company\u2019s sales and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe benefits of any restructuring activity may not be fully realized due to competitive, regulatory or operational difficulties; and\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to successfully manage the complex integration of systems, technology, networks and other assets of the combined Company in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on our customers, vendors, suppliers, employees and other constituencies.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that: (i) the Merger and restructuring activities and the Comprehensive Business Review will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect; (ii) these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe: (iii) we will be able to fully and accurately measure any such synergies; or (iv) we will be able to implement new strategies to transform the combined Company. Failure to successfully integrate the businesses and realize the projected synergies, innovation and operational efficiencies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is highly competitive and failure to adequately differentiate ourselves or respond to the decline in general office supplies sales or to shifting consumer demands could adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe office products market is highly competitive and we compete locally, domestically and internationally with office supply resellers, including Staples, wholesale clubs such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club and BJs, mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart and Target, computer and electronics superstores such as Best Buy, internet-based companies such as Amazon.com, food and drug stores, discount stores, and direct marketing companies. Many competitors have also increased their presence by broadening their assortments or broadening from retail into the delivery and e-commerce channels, while others have substantially greater financial resources to devote to sourcing, marketing and selling their products. Product pricing is also becoming ever more competitive, particularly among competitors on the internet. In order to achieve and maintain expected profitability levels, we must continue to grow by adding new customers and taking market share from competitors. In addition, consumers are utilizing more technology and purchasing less paper, ink and toner, physical file storage and general office supplies. If we are unable to: (i) provide technology solutions and services that meet consumer\nneeds; (ii) continuously stock products that are up-to-date and among the latest trends in the rapidly changing technological environment; (iii) differentiate ourselves from other retailers who sell similar products; and (iv) effectively compete, our sales and financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nFailure to execute effective advertising efforts may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nEffective advertising and marketing efforts play a crucial role in maintaining high customer traffic. The Company focuses on developing new marketing initiatives and maintaining effective promotional strategies that target further growth in the Company\u2019s business. Failure to execute effective advertising efforts to attract new customers or retain existing customers may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWith the increasing use of computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online, we offer full and mobile versions of our website and applications for mobile phones and tablets. In addition, we are increasing the use of social media as a means of interacting with our customers and enhancing their shopping experiences. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract third parties with the specialized skills needed to support our omni-channel platforms, or are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if our website and our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, the customer experience could be negatively affected, resulting in a loss of customer confidence and satisfaction, and lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nDisruptions of our computer systems could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely heavily on computer systems to process transactions, manage our inventory and supply-chain and to summarize and analyze our global business. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, or, if we do not replace or upgrade certain systems, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience an interruption of our normal business activities or loss of critical data. We are undertaking certain system enhancements and conversions to increase productivity and efficiency, that, if not done properly, could divert the attention of our workforce and constrain for some time our ability to provide the level of service our customers demand. Also, once implemented, the new systems and technology may not provide the intended efficiencies or anticipated benefits, and could add costs and complications to our ongoing operations.\nA breach of our information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships and operations and result in high costs.\nThrough our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain personally identifiable information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on our website, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. This may include, but is not limited to, names, addresses, phone numbers, driver license numbers, e-mail addresses, contact preferences, personally identifiable information stored on electronic devices, and payment account information, including credit and debit card information. We also gather and retain information about our employees in the normal course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, such as information permitting cashless payments.\nWe have instituted safeguards for the protection of such information. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, burglaries, cyber-attack, errors by employees or\nemployees of third-party vendors, faulty password management, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems and those of our vendors and unaffiliated third-parties are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or compromise given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. During the normal course of our business, we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience attempts to breach our systems, and we may be unable to protect sensitive data and the integrity of our systems or to prevent fraudulent purchases. Moreover, an alleged or actual security breach that affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information could:\n\u2022\nmaterially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to negative publicity, individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and\n\u2022\ncause us to incur substantial costs, including but not limited to costs associated with remediation for stolen assets or information, payments of customer incentives for the maintenance of business relationships after an attack, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack, and increased cyber security protection costs. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.\nWe do a significant amount of business with government entities, various purchasing consortiums, and through sole- or limited- source distribution arrangements, and loss of this business could negatively impact our results.\nOne of our largest customer groups consists of various governmental entities, government agencies and non-profit organizations, such as purchasing consortiums. Contracting with U.S. state and local governments is highly competitive, subject to federal and state procurement laws, requires more restrictive contract terms and can be expensive and time-consuming. Bidding such contracts often requires that we incur significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a contract. Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the federal and various state and local governments is highly dependent on cost-effective performance. Our business with governmental entities and agencies is also sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and their respective budgets, which in the current economy continue to decrease. We also service a substantial amount of business through agreements with purchasing consortiums and other sole- or limited-source distribution arrangements. If we are unsuccessful in retaining these customers, or if there is a significant reduction in sales under any of these arrangements, it could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nMacroeconomic conditions have had and may continue to adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur operating results and performance depend significantly on economic conditions and their impact on business and consumer spending. In the past, the decline in business and consumer spending has caused our comparable store sales to decline from prior periods. Our business and financial performance may continue to be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including, without limitation, the level of consumer debt, high levels of unemployment, higher interest rates and the ability of our customers to obtain credit, which may cause a continued or further decline in business and consumer spending.\nIncreases in fuel and other commodity prices could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nWe operate a large network of stores, delivery centers, and delivery vehicles. As such, we purchase significant amounts of fuel needed to transport products to our stores and customers as well as shipping costs to import products from overseas. While we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases, the underlying commodity costs\nassociated with this transport activity may be volatile and disruptions in availability of fuel could cause our operating costs to rise significantly to the extent not covered by our hedges. Additionally, other commodity prices, such as paper, may increase and we may not be able to pass along such costs to our customers. Fluctuations in the availability or cost of our energy and other commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks related to the activities of our third-party vendors.\nWe purchase products for resale under credit arrangements with our vendors and have been able to negotiate payment terms that are approximately equal in length to the time it takes to sell the vendor\u2019s products. When the global economy is experiencing weakness as it has over the last several years, vendors may seek credit insurance to protect against non-payment of amounts due to them. If we continue to experience declining operating performance, and if we experience severe liquidity challenges, vendors may demand that we accelerate our payment for their products or require cash on delivery, which could have an adverse impact on our operating cash flow and result in severe stress on our liquidity. Borrowings under our existing credit facility could reach maximum levels under such circumstances, causing us to seek alternative liquidity measures, but we may not be able to meet our obligations as they become due until we secure such alternative measures.\nWe use and resell many manufacturers\u2019 branded items and services. As a result, we are dependent on the availability and pricing of key products and services, including ink, toner, paper and technology products. As a reseller, we cannot control the supply, design, function, cost or vendor-required conditions of sale of many of the products we offer for sale. Disruptions in the availability of these products or the products and services we provide to our customers may adversely affect our sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. Further, we cannot control the cost of manufacturers\u2019 products, and cost increases must either be passed along to our customers or will result in erosion of our earnings.\nFailure to identify desirable products and make them available to our customers when desired and at attractive prices could have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. In addition, a material interruption in service by the carriers that ship goods within our supply chain may adversely affect our sales. Many of our vendors are small or medium sized businesses which are impacted by current macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S., Asia and other locations. We may have no warning before a vendor fails, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur product offering also includes many of our own branded products. While we have focused on the quality of our own branded products, we rely on third-party manufacturers for these products. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may not meet our expectations, such products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall those products, or such products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties. Furthermore, economic and political conditions in areas of the world where we source such products may adversely affect the availability and cost of such products. In addition, our own branded products compete with other manufacturers\u2019 branded items that we offer. As we continue to increase the number and types of our own branded products that we sell, we may adversely affect our relationships with our vendors, who may decide to reduce their product offerings through us and may increase their product offerings through our competitors. Finally, if any of our customers are harmed by our own branded products, they may bring product liability and other claims against us. Any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDisruption of global sourcing activities and our own brands\u2019 quality concerns could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.\nEconomic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both. Most of our goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and we are therefore subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports. In addition, in\nrecent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of products that we sell under our own brands including Office Depot \u00ae , OfficeMax \u00ae and other proprietary brands. While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from our expectations and standards, such products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall those products, or such products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties. Moreover, as we seek indemnities from the manufacturers of these products, the uncertainty of realization of any such indemnity and the lack of understanding of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions make it more likely that we may have to respond to claims or complaints from our customers.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, refinance indebtedness, obtain new funding or issue securities.\nWhile Merger- and restructuring-related costs have been significant between 2013 and 2016, historically, we have generated positive cash flow from operating activities and have had access to broad financial markets that provide the liquidity we need to operate our business. Together, these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs, as well as invest in business expansion through new store openings, capital improvements and acquisitions. Deterioration in our financial results or the impact of significant Merger, integration and restructuring costs could negatively impact our credit ratings, our liquidity and our access to the capital markets. If we need to refinance all or a portion of that indebtedness, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancing at the same or more favorable terms than the terms of our existing indebtedness.\nA default under our credit facility could significantly restrict our access to funding and adversely impact our operations.\nOur asset based credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that is operative only when borrowing availability is below $125 million or prior to a restricted transaction, such as incurring additional indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, or share repurchases if the Company does not have the required liquidity. The agreement governing our credit facility (the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d as defined in Note 7, \u201cDebt,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements) also contains representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and default provisions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Amended Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our asset based credit facility and our other indebtedness. Also, should there be an event of default, or a need to obtain waivers following an event of default, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and/or more restrictive covenants in future periods. Acceleration of our obligations under our credit facilities would permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations.\nWe have incurred significant impairment charges and we continue to incur impairment charges.\nIn recent years, we recognized significant non-cash asset impairment charges related to under-performing stores in North America. These charges reflect greater than anticipated downturns in sales at certain lower performing stores and in some cases, early closures associated with the Real Estate Strategy and the Comprehensive Business Review. We regularly assess past performance and make estimates and projections of future performance at an individual store level. Reduced sales, our shift in strategy to be less promotional, as well as competitive factors and changes in consumer spending habits resulted in a downward adjustment of anticipated future cash flows for the individual stores that resulted in the impairment. We foresee challenges in the market and economy that could adversely impact our operations. To the extent that forward-looking sales and operating assumptions are not achieved and are subsequently reduced, or if we commit to a more aggressive store downsizing strategy, including allocating capital to further modify store formats, additional impairment charges may result. We have also recognized non-cash asset impairment charges from the abandonment of assets identified as not to be used in\nthe post-Merger organization and from certain lease-related intangible assets that were deemed unrecoverable based on the Comprehensive Business Review. Additional asset impairments may be recognized based on future decisions and conditions.\nChanges in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates we make, in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, including changes resulting from macroeconomic, or disposition of components within reporting units, could in the future require a reduction of goodwill and recognition of related non-cash impairment charges. If we were required to further impair our store assets, our goodwill or intangible assets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation due to the seasonality of our business.\nOur business is somewhat seasonal, with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter, following the \u201cback-to-business\u201d sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the \u201cback-to-school\u201d sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter. As a result, our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, with sales and profitability being generally stronger in the second half of our fiscal year than the first half of our fiscal year. Factors that could also cause these quarterly fluctuations include: the pricing behavior of our competitors; the types and mix of products sold; the level of advertising and promotional expenses; severe weather; macroeconomic factors that affect consumer confidence; and the other risk factors described in this section. Most of our operating expenses, such as occupancy costs and associate salaries, are not variable, and so short term adjustments to reflect quarterly results are difficult. As a result, if sales in certain quarters are significantly below expectations, we may not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter, and therefore such a sales shortfall would have an adverse effect on our net income for the quarter.\nWe have retained responsibility for liabilities of acquired companies that may adversely affect our financial results\nOfficeMax sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering certain terminated employees, vested employees, retirees, and some active employees (the \u201cPension Plans\u201d). The Pension Plans are frozen and do not allow new entrants, however, they are under-funded and we may be required to make contributions in subsequent years in order to maintain required funding levels. Required future contributions could have an adverse impact on our cash flows and our financial results. Additional future contributions to the Pension Plans, financial market performance and Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) funding requirements could materially change these expected payments.\nAs part of the sale of our business in Europe, we have retained responsibility for the defined benefit plan covering certain employees in the United Kingdom. While the plan is in an asset position at the end of the year 2016, changes in assumptions and actual experience could result in that plan being considered underfunded in the future. Additionally, we have agreed to make contributions to the plan as required by the trustees. Financial performance of the plan and future valuation assumptions could materially change the expected payments. In addition, as part of the sale transaction, the purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Company harmless in connection with any guarantees in place as of September 23, 2016, and given by Company in respect of the liabilities or obligations of the OD European Business. Further, if the purchaser wishes to terminate any such guarantee or cease to comply with any underlying obligation which is subject to such a guarantee, the purchaser shall obtain an unconditional and irrevocable release of the guarantee. However, the Company is contingently liable in the event of a breach by the purchaser of any such obligation.\nIn connection with OfficeMax\u2019s sale of its paper, forest products and timberland assets in 2004, OfficeMax agreed to assume responsibility for certain liabilities of the businesses sold. These obligations include liabilities related to environmental, asbestos, health and safety, tax, litigation and employee benefit matters. Some of these retained liabilities could turn out to be significant, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our exposure to these liabilities could harm our ability to compete with other office products distributors, who would not typically be subject to similar liabilities.\nChanges in tax laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate can cause fluctuations in our overall tax rate impacting our reported earnings.\nOur tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. While we have disposed of certain international businesses and are actively marketing for sale other international businesses, we remain subject to international taxes in other businesses. Depending upon the sources of our income, any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, and the tax filing positions we take in these jurisdictions, our overall tax rate may fluctuate significantly from other companies or even our own past tax rates. At any given point in time, we base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our Company and to estimates of the amount of income likely to be generated in any given geography. The loss of or modification to one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, whether as a result of a third party challenge, negotiation, or otherwise, a change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in valuation allowances, or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in substantial volatility, including an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate and/or our effective tax rate.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on our executive management team and other key personnel, and the recruitment and retention of certain personnel could adversely affect our performance and result in the loss of management continuity and institutional knowledge. We depend heavily upon our retail labor force to identify new customers and provide desired products and personalized customer service to existing customers. The market for qualified employees, with the right talent and competencies, is highly competitive, and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment. The loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers for our retail stores and other lines of business may adversely affect our ability to conduct operations in accordance with the standards that we have set.\nAlthough certain members of our executive team have entered into agreements relating to their employment with us, most of our key personnel are not bound by employment agreements, and those with employment or retention agreements are bound only for a limited period of time. If we are unable to retain our key personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, which from time to time may involve class action lawsuits, state and federal governmental inquiries, audits and investigations, environmental matters, employment, tort, state false claims act, consumer litigation and intellectual property litigation. At times, such matters may involve directors and/or executive officers. Certain of these legal proceedings, including government investigations, may be a significant distraction to management and could expose our Company to significant liability, including settlement expenses, damages, fines, penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and non-monetary sanctions, including suspensions and debarments from doing business with certain government agencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to successfully manage our business could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nCircumstances outside of our control could negatively impact anticipated store openings, joint ventures, strategic alliances and franchise arrangements. We cannot provide assurance that our new store openings, including some newly sized or formatted stores or retail concepts, will be successful. There may be unintended consequences of adding joint venture, strategic alliances and franchising partners to the Office Depot model, such as the potential for compromised operational control in certain countries and inconsistent international brand image. These joint\nventure, strategic alliances and franchise arrangements may also add complexity to our processes, and may require unanticipated operational adjustments in the future that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to risks as foreign currency fluctuations, potential unfavorable foreign trade policies or unstable political and economic conditions.\nUntil the disposition of our International Sale Group is complete, we remain subject to various international risks. Additionally, we have operations in Canada and certain global sourcing operations in Asia. Sales from our operations outside the U.S. are denominated in local currency, which must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and therefore our consolidated earnings can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in world currency markets. We are required to comply with multiple foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country, requiring significant management attention and cost. In addition, the business cultures in certain areas of the world are different than those that prevail in the U.S., and we may be at a competitive disadvantage against other companies that do not have to comply with standards of financial controls or business integrity that we are committed to maintaining as a U.S. publicly traded company.\nWe may be unable to realize intended benefits from our efforts to divest the International Sale Group.\nIn order to operate more efficiently, control costs and simplify our business, we intend to sell substantially all of our remaining international business operations located in South Korea, mainland China, Australia and New Zealand during 2017; however, we may not be able to sell one or more of these businesses within the anticipated timeline or at all. We also cannot be sure that the divestitures will be successful in reducing our overall expenses and the expected efficiencies, benefits and cost savings might be delayed or not realized.\nChanges in the regulatory environment may increase our expenses and may negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to regulations relating to our corporate conduct and the conduct of our business, including securities laws, consumer protection laws, trade regulations, advertising regulations, privacy and cybersecurity laws, and wage and hour regulations and anti-corruption legislation. Certain jurisdictions have taken a particularly aggressive stance with respect to such matters and have implemented new initiatives and reforms, including more stringent regulations, disclosure and compliance requirements. For example, we purchase product both directly and indirectly from sources outside of the United States. As a consequence, trade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs, quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase our cost of goods sold or reduce the supply of the products available to us. There is no assurance that any such increased costs could be passed on to our customers, or that we could find alternative products from other sources at comparable prices. To the extent that we are subject to more challenging regulatory environments and enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, such exposure could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the added cost of increased compliance measures that we may determine to be necessary.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws. However, we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in the cost of employee health benefits could impact the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flow.\nOur business could be disrupted due to weather-related factors.\nOur operations are heavily concentrated in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. (including Illinois, Ohio, Florida and the Gulf Coast). Because of our concentration in the Southern U.S., we may be more susceptible than some of our competitors to the effects of tropical weather disturbances, such as tornadoes and hurricanes. In addition, winter storm conditions in areas that have a large concentration of our business activities could also result in reduced demand for our products, lost retail sales, supply chain constraints or other business disruptions. We believe that we have taken reasonable precautions to prepare for weather-related events, but our precautions may not be adequate to mitigate the adverse effect of such events in the future.\nThe unionization of a significant portion of our workforce could increase our overall costs and adversely affect our operations.\nWe have a large employee base and while our management believes that our employee relations are good, we cannot be assured that we will not experience organization efforts from labor unions. The potential for unionization could increase if federal legislation is passed that would facilitate labor organization. Significant union representation would require us to negotiate wages, salaries, benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results of operations by significantly increasing our labor costs or otherwise restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has been and may continue to be subject to volatility, and this and other factors may affect elements of the Company\u2019s capital allocation strategy such as share repurchases and dividends.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced volatility over time and this volatility may continue, in part due to factors mentioned in this Item 1A. Stock volatility in itself may adversely affect shareholder confidence as well as elements of the Company\u2019s capital allocation strategy.\nAs part of its capital allocation strategy, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock and in July 2016, the Board of Directors authorized increasing the share repurchase program to $250 million of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the Board of Directors has also authorized a quarterly dividend program. Decisions regarding share repurchases and dividends are within the discretion of the Board of Directors, and will be influenced by a number of factors, including the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, general business and economic conditions, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, the emergence of alternative investment or acquisition opportunities, changes in business strategy and other factors. Changes in, or the elimination of, the Company\u2019s share repurchase programs or its dividend could have an adverse effect on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nDisclaimer of Obligation to Update\nWe assume no obligation (and specifically disclaim any such obligation) to update these Risk Factors or any other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 75573, "SIC": 5940, "TIC": "ODP"}
