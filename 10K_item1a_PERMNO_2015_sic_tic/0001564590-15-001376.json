{"cik": "1288403", "company": "W&T OFFSHORE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to us and our industry could materially impact our future performance and results of operations. We have provided below a list of known material risk factors that should be reviewed when considering buying or selling our securities. These are not all the risks we face and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nSubstantial or extended declines in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments and to implement our business strategy.\nThe price we receive for our oil, NGLs and natural gas production directly affects our revenues, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities and are subject to wide price fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Lower prices for our oil, NGLs and natural gas production may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis but may also reduce the amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically. Historically, the markets for oil, NGLs and natural gas have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production and the volume of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in global supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d);\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil, NGLs, natural gas and liquefied natural gas;\n\u00b7\nacts of war, terrorism or political instability in oil producing countries;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions and events, including embargoes, affecting oil-producing activities;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activities;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u00b7\ngeographic differences in pricing.\nThe prices of crude oil, domestic natural gas and NGLs have declined substantially since June 2014. The price of West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) crude oil has decreased from $107 per barrel in the middle of June 2014 to as low as $44 per barrel in January 2015. This decrease in prices has impacted all oil and gas producers to varying degrees depending on hedging strategies. Natural gas and NGLs prices have been negatively affected by excess natural gas production, high levels of stored natural gas and weather conditions affecting demand. In recent months, Henry Hub spot prices for natural gas have declined to prices lower than $3.00 per Mcf compared to average prices during 2014 in excess of $4.00 per Mcf. There have been significant recent development activities in shale and other resource plays, which have the potential to yield a significant amount of natural gas and NGLs production, as well as natural gas and NGLs produced in connection with increased domestic oil drilling activities. The potential increases in natural gas supplies resulting from the large-scale development of these unconventional resource reserves could continue to have an adverse impact on the price of natural gas and NGLs. An environment of further or continued lower oil, NGLs and natural gas prices would materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nIf oil, NGLs and natural gas prices stay at their current levels or decrease further, we will likely be required to write down the carrying values and/or the estimates of total reserves of our oil and natural gas properties.\nAccounting rules applicable to us require that we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we will likely be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Such write-downs constitute a non-cash charge to earnings. Impairment of proved properties under our full cost oil and gas accounting method is largely driven by the present values of future net revenues of proved reserves estimated using SEC mandated 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month commodity prices. Since oil, gas and NGLs prices did not decline in 2014 until after June 2014, and more prominently in the fourth quarter of 2014, the impact of the recent pricing downturns will continue to adversely affect our SEC average pricing as recent and current prices roll into the SEC average prices used in evaluating impairment of our proved reserves under the full cost accounting \u201cceiling test\u201d. While we have not had any ceiling test impairments since 2009, sustained current prices or further declines in prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas will likely result in future ceiling test impairments. You should not assume that the $2.6 billion present value of future net revenues, PV-10, from our proved oil and natural gas reserves shown elsewhere in this document is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. (PV-10 is not a financial measure defined under GAAP. For additional information about our proved reserves and a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see Properties - Proved Reserve under Part I, Item 2 in this Form 10-K.) In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month average price for each product and costs in effect on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. For example, the average price used in the standardized measure of discounted cash flows for December 31, 2014 for crude oil was $91.12 per barrel and the average price of WTI crude oil in December 2014 was $59.29 per barrel. No assurance can be given that we will not experience ceiling test impairments in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods taken. As a result of lower oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, we may also reduce our estimates of the reserve volumes that may be economically recovered, which would reduce the total value of our proved reserves. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Impairment of oil and natural gas properties under Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on the ceiling test.\nWe may be limited in our ability to maintain proved undeveloped reserves under current SEC guidance.\nCurrent SEC guidance requires proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. This rule may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. If current low price conditions persist, we also may be compelled to further postpone the drilling of proved undeveloped reserves until prices recover. Further, if we postpone drilling of proved undeveloped reserves beyond this five-year development horizon, we may have to write off reserves previously recognized as proved undeveloped.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 31% of our total proved reserves were undeveloped and approximately 12% of our total proved reserves were developed non-producing. There can be no assurance that all of those reserves will ultimately be developed or produced.\nOur undeveloped proved reserves and developed non-producing proved reserves require additional expenditures and/or activities to convert these into producing reserves. We cannot provide assurance these expenditures will be made and that activities will be entirely successful in converting these reserves. Additionally, we are not the operator for approximately 17% of our undeveloped proved reserves and approximately 11% of our proved developed non-producing reserves, so we may not be in a position to control the timing of all development activities. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that all of our undeveloped and developed non-producing reserves will ultimately be produced during the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have budgeted, or at all, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves.\nRelatively short production periods for our Gulf of Mexico properties subject us to high reserve replacement needs and require significant capital expenditures to replace our reserves at a faster rate than companies whose reserves have longer production periods. Our failure to replace those reserves would result in decreasing reserves, production and cash flows over time.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities at sufficient levels or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reserves are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. High production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves during the initial few years of production. The majority of our current production is from the Gulf of Mexico. Reserves in the Gulf of Mexico generally decline more rapidly than from reserves in many other producing regions of the United States. Our independent petroleum consultant estimates that 42% of our total proved reserves will be depleted within three years. As a result, our need to replace reserves and production from new investments is relatively greater than that of producers who recover lower percentages of their reserves over a similar time period, such as those producers who have a larger portion of their reserves in areas other than the Gulf of Mexico. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves in sufficient quantities to sustain our current production levels or to grow production beyond current levels. In addition, due to the significant time requirements involved with exploration and development activities, particularly for wells in the deepwater or wells not located near existing infrastructure, actual oil and natural gas production from new wells may not occur, if at all, for a considerable period of time following the commencement of any particular project.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves. If we are not able to replace reserves, we will not be able to sustain production at current levels.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and acquisitions with cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, securities offerings and bank borrowings. The capital markets we have historically accessed are currently constrained, but we believe we could access other capital markets if the need arises. These limitations in the capital markets may affect our ability to grow and changes in our capitalization structure may significantly affect our financial risk profile. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that financing for future capital expenditures will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. For additional financing risks, see \u201c- Risks Related to Financings.\u201d\nFuture cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. Any reductions in our capital expenditures to stay within internally generated cash flow (which could be adversely affected by declining commodity prices) and cash on hand will make replacing produced reserves more difficult. If our cash flow from operations and cash on hand are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may be limited in our ability to access additional debt, equity or other methods of financing on an economic or timely basis to replace our proved reserves.\nLower oil and natural gas prices could negatively impact our ability to borrow.\nAs of December 31, 2014, borrowing availability under our revolving bank credit facility was $750 million, less outstanding borrowings of $447 million and letters of credit of less than $1 million, resulting in net availability of $302 million. Availability is determined semi-annually by our lenders and is based on oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and on our proved reserves. Substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) governing our revolving bank credit facility. The Credit Agreement limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness based on specified financial covenants, ratios or other criteria. Sustained and/or lower oil, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future could result in a reduction in credit availability and also affect our ability to satisfy these covenants, ratios or other criteria and thus could reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness and our ability to replace reserves.\nThe Company could face additional requirements if it does not comply with the terms of its probation.\nOn January 3, 2013, the Company (i) pled guilty to one felony count under the Clean Water Act for altering monthly produced water discharge samples for the Ewing Banks 910 platform in 2009 and one misdemeanor count under the Clean Water Act for failure to report the discharge of a small amount of oil from the same platform in November 2009, (ii) paid a $0.7 million fine and $0.3 million for community service and (iii) entered into an environmental compliance program subject to a third-party audit. Under the agreement, the Company was placed on a three-year term of probation, which ends on January 3, 2016. The probation terms require that the Company commit no further environmental law violations, comply with an Environmental Compliance Plan during the probation period and take no adverse action against personnel who cooperated in the investigation. The agreement further stipulates that the Government will not seek any further criminal charges against the Company in this matter. Failure to comply with the terms of the agreement could lead to additional requirements and/or operating restrictions.\nMore stringent regulatory initiatives relating to offshore exploration and production activities may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nIn April 2010, there was a fire and explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform operated by BP in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of the explosion and ensuing fire, the rig sank, causing loss of life, and created a major oil spill that produced economic, environmental and natural resource damage in the Gulf Coast region. In response to the explosion and spill, there have been many proposals, and substantial rules adopted, by governmental and private constituencies to address the direct impact of the disaster and to prevent similar disasters in the future. The federal government, acting through the U.S. Department of the Interior and its implementing agencies that have since evolved into the present day BOEM and BSEE, has issued various rules, NTLs and temporary drilling moratoria. These rules and requirements impose or result in added environmental and safety measures upon exploration, development and production operators in the Gulf of Mexico including the following:\n\u00b7\nThe Environmental NTL, which imposes new and more stringent requirements for documenting the environmental impacts potentially associated with the drilling of a new offshore well and significantly increases oil spill response requirements.\n\u00b7\nThe Compliance and Review NTL, which imposes requirements for operators to secure independent reviews of well design, construction and flow intervention processes, and also requires certifications of compliance from senior corporate officers.\n\u00b7\nThe Drilling Safety Rule, which prescribes tighter cementing and casing practices, imposes standards for the use of drilling fluids to maintain well bore integrity, and stiffens oversight requirements relating to blowout preventers and their components, including shear and pipe rams.\n\u00b7\nThe Workplace Safety Rule requires operators to employ a comprehensive safety and environmental management system (\u201cSEMS\u201d). The purpose of SEMS is to reduce human and organizational errors as root causes of work-related accidents and offshore spills; develop protocols as to who at the facility has the ultimate operational safety and decision-making authority; establish procedures to provide all personnel with \u201cstop work\u201d authority; and, to have their SEMS periodically audited by an independent third party auditor approved by BSEE.\nThese new regulatory initiatives may serve to effectively slow down the pace of drilling and production operations in the Gulf of Mexico due to adjustments in operating procedures and certification practices as well as increased lead times to obtain exploration and production plan reviews, develop drilling applications, and apply for and receive new well permits. These new requirements also increase the cost of preparing permit applications and increase the cost of each new well, particularly for wells drilled in the deepwater on the OCS. We could become subject to fines, penalties or orders requiring us to modify or suspend our operations in the Gulf of Mexico if we fail to comply with these requirements. Moreover, if similar oil spill incidents were to occur in the future in the Gulf of Mexico or elsewhere where we conduct operations, the relevant governmental authorities could elect to again issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities. In any event, they may from time to time issue further safety and environmental regulatory initiatives regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, which any one or more of such events could have a material adverse effect on our production activities as well as our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nRequirements imposed by the BOEM and BSEE related to the decommissioning, plugging, and abandonment of offshore facilities could significantly impact the cost of operating our business.\nIn addition to the NTLs discussed previously, the BOEM issued NTL No. 2010-G05 dated effective October 15, 2010 that establishes a more stringent regimen for the timely decommissioning of what is known as \u201cidle iron\u201d - wells, platforms and pipelines that are no longer producing or serving exploration or support functions related to an operator\u2019s lease - in the Gulf of Mexico. This NTL sets forth more stringent standards for decommissioning timing requirements by requiring that any well that has not been used during the past five years for exploration or production on active leases and is no longer capable of producing in paying quantities must be permanently plugged or temporarily abandoned within three years. Plugging or abandonment of wells may be delayed by two years if all of the well\u2019s hydrocarbon and sulfur zones are appropriately isolated. Similarly, platforms or other facilities which are no longer useful for operations must be removed within five years of the cessation of operations. The triggering of these plugging, abandonment and removal activities under what may be viewed as an accelerated schedule in comparison to historical decommissioning efforts which could cause an increase, perhaps materially, in our future plugging, abandonment and removal costs, which may translate into a need to increase our estimate of future ARO required to meet such increased costs. We have continued to review and revise our ARO estimates each year following BOEM\u2019s issuance of this NTL. The increase in decommissioning activity in the Gulf of Mexico expected over the next few years as a result of the NTL may result in increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment, resulting in increased estimates of plugging, abandonment and removal costs and increases in related ARO.\nTo cover the various obligations of lessees on the OCS, the BOEM generally requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to regulations or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied. In addition, in August 2014, the BOEM issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which the agency indicated that it was considering increasing the financial assurance requirements for companies operating in federal waters. If BOEM were to increase its financial assurance requirements substantially, such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The significant reductions in oil and natural gas pricing since the middle of 2014 may also adversely impact the BOEM\u2019s financial assurance determinations with respect to the Company. The cost of these bonds or assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases. Under some circumstances, the BOEM may require any of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the BOEM can require supplemental bonding from operators for decommissioning, plugging, and abandonment liabilities if financial strength and reliability criteria are not met.\nProposed rules regulating air emissions from oil and gas operations could cause us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs.\nThe EPA has adopted new regulations under the CAA that, among other things, require additional emissions controls for the production of oil, NGLs and natural gas, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and VOCs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with such production activities. The final regulations require, among other things, the reduction of VOC emissions through the use of reduced emission completions or \u201cgreen completions\u201d on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. For well completion operations occurring at such well sites before January 1, 2015, the final regulations allow operators to capture and direct flowback emissions to completion combustion devices, such as flares, in lieu of performing green completions. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. Compliance with these requirements could significantly increase our costs of development and production.\nLosses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe could be exposed to uninsured losses in the future. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event not covered in whole or in part by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations. Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance. In May and June 2014, we renewed our insurance policies covering well control, hurricane damage, general liability and pollution. These policies reduce, but do not totally mitigate, our risk as we are exposed to amounts for retention and co-insurance, limits on coverage and some events that are not insured. These policies expire in May and June 2015. We also have other smaller per-occurrence retention amounts for various other events. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable, as gradual seepage and pollution are not covered under our policies. Because third-party drilling contractors are used to drill our wells, we may not realize the full benefit of workmen\u2019s compensation laws in dealing with their employees. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Hurricane Remediation, Insurance Claims and Insurance Coverage under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information on insurance coverage.\nInsurance for well control and hurricane damage may become significantly more expensive for less coverage, and some losses currently covered by insurance may not be covered in the future.\nDue to insurance claims in recent years associated with hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and global catastrophic losses, property damage and well control insurance coverage has become more limited and the cost of such coverage has become both more costly and more volatile. The insurance market may change dramatically in the future due to the major oil spill that occurred in 2010 at BP\u2019s Macondo well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. As of December 31, 2014, virtually all of our PV-10 value of proved reserves attributable to our Gulf of Mexico properties is on platforms that are covered under our current insurance policies for named windstorm damage. Our insurers may not continue to offer us the type and level of our current coverage, or our costs may increase substantially as a result of increased premiums and there could be an increased risk of uninsured losses that may have been previously insured. We are also exposed to the possibility that in the future we will be unable to buy insurance at any price or that if we do have claims, the insurance companies will not pay our claims. The occurrence of any or all of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCommodity derivative positions may limit our potential gains.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risk in the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we may periodically enter into oil and natural gas price commodity derivative positions with respect to a portion of our expected production. While these commodity derivative positions are intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, they may also limit future income if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by such positions. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u00b7\nour production is less than expected;\n\u00b7\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge arrangements; or\n\u00b7\nthe counterparties to the derivative contracts fail to perform under the terms of the contracts.\nSee Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 6 - Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on derivative transactions.\nCompetition for oil and natural gas properties and prospects is intense; some of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that may give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil, NGLs and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors have financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical expertise and personnel than we have. We actively compete with other companies in our industry when acquiring new leases or oil and natural gas properties. For example, new leases acquired from the BOEM are acquired through a \u201csealed bid\u201d process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder. Our competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay. On the acquisition opportunities made available to us, we compete with other companies in our industry for such properties through a private bidding process, direct negotiations or some combination thereof. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted. The availability of properties for acquisition depends largely on the divesting practices of other oil and natural gas companies, commodity prices, general economic conditions and other factors we cannot control or influence. Additional requirements and limitations recently imposed on us may put us at a competitive disadvantage for acquiring properties. These risks are described above in the risk factor entitled: Requirements imposed by the BOEM and BSEE related to the decommissioning, plugging, and abandonment of offshore facilities could significantly impact the cost of operating our business.\nWe conduct exploration, development and production operations on the deep shelf and in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, which presents unique operating risks.\nThe deep shelf and the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico are areas that have had less drilling activity due, in part, to their geological complexity, depth and higher cost to drill and ultimately develop. There are additional risks associated with deep shelf and deepwater drilling that could result in substantial cost overruns and/or result in uneconomic projects or wells. Deeper targets are more difficult to interpret with traditional seismic processing. Moreover, drilling costs and the risk of mechanical failure are significantly higher because of the additional depth and adverse conditions, such as high temperature and pressure. For example, the drilling of deepwater wells requires specific types of rigs with significantly higher day rates and limited availability, as compared to the rigs used in shallower water. Deepwater wells have greater mechanical risks because the wellhead equipment is installed on the sea floor. Deepwater development costs can be significantly higher than development costs for wells drilled on the conventional shelf because deepwater drilling requires larger installation equipment, sophisticated sea floor production handling equipment, expensive state-of-the-art platforms and investment in infrastructure. Deep shelf development can also be more expensive than conventional shelf projects because deep shelf development requires more drilling days and higher drilling and service costs due to extreme pressure and temperatures associated with greater depths. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our oil and natural gas exploration activities in the deep shelf, the deepwater and elsewhere will be commercially successful.\nOur estimates of future asset retirement obligations may vary significantly from period to period and are especially significant because our operations are concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico.\nWe are required to record a liability for the present value of our ARO to plug and abandon inactive non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, facilities and equipment, and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. These costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be many years in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or more restrictive interpretation, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased costs. As a result, we may make significant increases or decreases to our estimated ARO in future periods. For example, because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes. The estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimate of future ARO could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur as a result of platform damage.\nAs described above in the risk factor titled \u201cNew requirements imposed by the BOEM and BSEE related to the decommissioning, plugging, and abandonment of offshore facilities could significantly impact the cost of operating our business,\u201d the BOEM\u2019s NTL 2010-G05 increased our liability for ARO by accelerating the time frame for plugging, abandonment and removal for some of our platforms and the BOEM further increased our liability after issuing regulation interpretations which affected scope and requirements. In addition, the potential increase in decommissioning activity in the Gulf of Mexico over the next several years as a result of the NTL could likely result in increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment, resulting in increased estimates of plugging, abandonment and removal costs and increases in related ARO.\nWe may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts, associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves from our non-operated properties.\nAs we carry out our drilling program, we may not serve as operator of all planned wells. We have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties and their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs of properties operated by others could prevent the realization of anticipated results in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of exploration and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\napproval of other participants in drilling wells and such participants\u2019 financial resources;\n\u00b7\nselection of technology; and\n\u00b7\nthe rate of production of the reserves.\nOur business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nOur development activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including adverse weather conditions, cost overruns, equipment shortages, geological issues and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of a natural gas or oil well does not assure us that we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. In addition to their costs, unsuccessful wells hinder our efforts to replace reserves.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities which include, among other things, hydraulic fracturing, involve a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u00b7\nfires;\n\u00b7\nexplosions;\n\u00b7\nblow-outs and surface cratering;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, such as tropical storms, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\ninability to obtain insurance at reasonable rates;\n\u00b7\nfailure to receive payment on insurance claims in a timely manner, or for the full amount claimed;\n\u00b7\npipe, cement, subsea well or pipeline failures;\n\u00b7\ncasing collapses or failures;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as lost or stuck oil field drilling and service tools;\n\u00b7\nabnormally pressured formations or rock compaction; and\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures, encountering NORM, and discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment.\nIf we experience any of these problems, well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations;\n\u00b7\nrepairs required to resume operations; and\n\u00b7\nloss of reserves.\nOffshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks related to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from tropical storms, hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development and acquisitions or result in the loss of property and equipment.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenues or curtailment of production from factors specifically affecting the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties along the U.S. Gulf Coast and adjacent waters on and beyond the OCS means that some or all of our properties could be affected by the same event should the Gulf of Mexico experience:\n\u00b7\nsevere weather, including tropical storms and hurricanes;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in the regulatory environment.\nBecause a majority of our properties could experience the same conditions at the same time, these conditions could have a greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other operators who have properties over a wider geographic area. For example, net production of approximately 8.7 Bcfe was deferred as a result of damage caused primarily by Hurricane Ike in 2009 and Hurricane Isaac caused net production deferral of approximately 2.9 Bcfe in 2012.\nAs we increase our onshore operations, we will be subject to different risk factors that could impact loss of revenues or curtailment of production for these geographies.\nOnshore oil and gas exploration and production operations share similar risk factors to offshore, but also have some different regulations, interpretation of regulations and enforcement by the particular state in which the operations are conducted. Until 2011, our experience has primarily been with offshore operations. We are subject to and must comply with the various state regulations and work effectively with the state agencies, and failure to do so may impact our operations.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight rock formations. We utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in connection with developing our properties in the Spraberry field and other onshore properties. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppants and chemicals under pressure into the rock formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. The EPA, however, recently asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel under the SDWA Underground Injection Control Program and issued permitting guidance covering such activities in February 2015. In addition, the EPA has commenced a broad study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing activities, and the agency has indicated that it expects to issue its study report in 2015. A number of other federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, Department of Interior, and White House Council on Environmental Quality, are also studying various aspects of hydraulic fracturing. The results of these studies could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. From time to time, legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states and local governments have adopted, and other states and local governments are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, including states in which we operate. For example, in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to immediately identify liabilities associated with these properties or obtain protection from sellers against them.\nOur business strategy includes growing by making acquisitions, which may include acquisitions of exploration and production companies, producing properties and undeveloped leasehold interests. Our acquisition of oil and natural gas properties requires assessments of many factors that are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following:\n\u00b7\nacceptable prices for available properties;\n\u00b7\namounts of recoverable reserves;\n\u00b7\nestimates of future oil, NGLs and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nestimates of future exploratory, development and operating costs;\n\u00b7\nestimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u00b7\nestimates of potential environmental and other liabilities.\nOur assessment of the acquired properties will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to fully assess their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our due diligence, we have historically not physically inspected every well, platform or pipeline. Even if we had physically inspected each of these, our inspections may not have revealed structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion, well bore issues or groundwater contamination. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities associated with such risks. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nWe may encounter difficulties integrating the operations of newly acquired oil and natural gas properties or businesses.\nIncreasing our reserve base through acquisitions is an important part of our business strategy. We may encounter difficulties integrating the operations of newly acquired oil and natural gas properties or businesses. In particular, we may face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, personnel and operations in an effective manner. The failure to successfully integrate such properties or businesses into our business may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any acquisition we make may involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\na significant increase in our indebtedness and working capital requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets;\n\u00b7\nthe incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets, including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets before our acquisition;\n\u00b7\nour lack of drilling history in the geographic areas in which the acquired business operates;\n\u00b7\ncustomer or key employee loss from the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nincreased administration of new personnel;\n\u00b7\nadditional costs due to increased scope and complexity of our operations; and\n\u00b7\npotential disruption of our ongoing business.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that we acquire properties substantially different from the properties in our primary operating region or acquire properties that require different technical expertise, we may not be able to realize the economic benefits of these acquisitions as efficiently as with acquisitions within our primary operating region. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisition we may make.\nEstimates of our proved reserves depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in the estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities of and present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and the calculation of the present value of our reserves at December 31, 2014. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Oil and natural gas reserve quantities, under Part II, Item 7 for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves information reported in Business under Part I, Item 1, Properties under Part I, Item 2 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K.\nIn order to prepare our year-end reserve estimates, our independent petroleum consultant projected our production rates and timing of development expenditures. Our independent petroleum consultant also analyzed available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary and may not be under our control. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, our independent petroleum consultant may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, drilling results, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month average price for each product and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, which prices are not reflective of the substantially lower prices realized in December 2014 and January 2015. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercial quantities or quantities sufficient to meet our targeted rate of return.\nA prospect is an area in which we own an interest, could acquire an interest or have operating rights, and have what our geoscientists believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of economic accumulations of oil or natural gas. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to be drilled to a prospect that will require substantial seismic data processing and interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling and completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure that the analysis we perform using data from other wells, more fully explored prospects and/or producing fields will accurately predict the characteristics and potential reserves associated with our drilling prospects. The recent downturn in oil and natural gas pricing will also significantly impact the projected rates of return of our projects without the assurance of significant reductions in costs of drilling and development. To the extent we drill additional wells in the deepwater and/or on the deep shelf, our drilling activities could become more expensive. In addition, the geological complexity of deepwater, deep shelf and various onshore formations may make it more difficult for us to sustain our historical rates of drilling success. As a result, we can offer no assurance that we will find commercial quantities of oil and natural gas and, therefore, we can offer no assurance that we will achieve positive rates of return on our investments.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends substantially on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, which in most cases are owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells because of a reduction in demand for our production or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipelines or gathering system capacity. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to deliver our production to market. We have, in the past, been required to shut in wells when hurricanes have caused or threatened damage to pipelines and gathering stations. For example, in September 2008, as a result of Hurricane Ike, two of our operated platforms and eight non-operated platforms were toppled and a number of platforms, third-party pipelines and processing facilities upon which we depend to deliver our production to the marketplace were damaged. In 2012, under threat of Hurricane Isaac, we shut in most of our offshore production for a period of 10 to 25 days. Similar shut-ins of lower magnitude occurred in 2013.\nIn some cases, our wells are tied back to platforms owned by parties who do not have an economic interest in our wells and we cannot be assured that such parties will continue to process our oil and natural gas.\nCurrently, a portion of our oil and natural gas is processed for sale on platforms owned by parties with no economic interest in our wells and no other processing facilities would be available to process such oil and natural gas without significant investment by us. In addition, third-party platforms could be damaged or destroyed by hurricanes which could reduce or eliminate our ability to market our production. As of December 31, 2014, 12 fields, accounting for approximately 12.8 Bcfe (or 12%) of our 2014 production, are tied back to separate, third-party owned platforms. There can be no assurance that the owners of such platforms will continue to process our oil and natural gas production. If any of these platform operators ceases to operate their processing equipment, we may be required to shut in the associated wells, construct additional facilities or assume additional liability to re-establish production.\nIf third-party pipelines connected to our facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport our natural gas or oil, or if the prices charged by these third-party pipelines increase, our revenues or costs could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines that provide delivery options from our facilities. Because we do not own or operate these pipelines, their continued operation is not within our control. If any of these third-party pipelines become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas and oil, or if the gas quality specification for the natural gas pipelines changes so as to restrict our ability to transport natural gas on those pipelines, our revenues could be adversely affected. For example, in 2013, various pipelines were shut down causing production deferral of approximately 6.3 Bcfe. Our Mississippi Canyon 506 field (Wrigley) was the field most significantly affected by the shutdowns, as it was shut down for all of 2013 and more than half of 2014.\nCertain third-party pipelines have submitted or have made plans to submit requests to increase the fees they charge us to use these pipelines. These increased fees could adversely impact our revenues or operating costs, either of which would adversely impact our operating profits, cash flows and reserves.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration, development, production and transportation of oil and natural gas and operational safety. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with such legal requirements may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with governmental regulations, such as:\n\u00b7\nland use restrictions;\n\u00b7\nlease permit restrictions;\n\u00b7\ndrilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements, such as plugging and abandonment bonds;\n\u00b7\nspacing of wells;\n\u00b7\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u00b7\nsafety precautions;\n\u00b7\noperational reporting;\n\u00b7\nreporting of natural gas sales for resale; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries;\n\u00b7\nproperty and natural resource damages;\n\u00b7\nwell site reclamation costs; and\n\u00b7\ngovernmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties.\nOur operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. It is also possible that a portion of our oil and natural gas properties could be subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings for which we may not be adequately compensated. See Business - Regulation under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed explanation of our regulatory risks.\nOur operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u00b7\nrequire the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences;\n\u00b7\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;\n\u00b7\nlimit or prohibit exploration or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas or that may affect certain wildlife, including marine mammals; and\n\u00b7\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u00b7\nthe assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u00b7\nloss of our leases;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations; and\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of injunctive relief.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and regardless of whether our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. Our permits require that we report any incidents that cause or could cause environmental damages. See Business - Regulation under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our environmental risks.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nThe EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA has adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one of which imposes preconstruction and operating permit requirements of certain large stationary sources. The EPA also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis.\nIn addition, the United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such affects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Please see - Our business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation and regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the negative effect of commodity price changes, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nIn July 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDF Act\u201d), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The DF Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the DF Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Colombia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us in connection with covered derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although the Company expects to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the Company uses for hedging. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margins. Posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to the Company for its needs. The DF Act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.\nThe full impact of the DF Act and related regulatory requirements upon the Company\u2019s business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The DF Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties or reduce liquidity. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the DF Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nFinally, the DF Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the DF Act is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe own a platform in a highly regulated National Marine Sanctuary, which increases our compliance costs and subjects us to risk of significant fines and penalties if we do not maintain rigorous compliance.\nWe own a platform located in a National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico that is subject to special federal laws and regulations. This production platform is not producing and will be plugged, abandoned and remediated according to regulations. Unique regulations related to operations in the Sanctuary include, among other things, prohibition of drilling activities within certain protected areas, restrictions on substances that may be discharged, depths of discharge in connection with drilling and production activities and limitations on mooring of vessels. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations or the imposition of injunctive relief, including cessation of production from wells associated with this platform.\nRestrictions on our ability to obtain water for our onshore operations may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.\nWater is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, operators in the Permian Basin have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in their operations. According to the Lower Colorado River Authority, during 2011 Texas experienced the lowest inflows of water of any year in recorded history. Severe drought conditions persisted over the past several years in certain parts of Texas and are projected to continue in 2015. As a result, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically drill for oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by security breaches, including cyber-security breaches, which could affect our production of oil and natural gas or could affect other parts of our business.\nWe face security exposure, including cyber-security exposure, from unauthorized access to our facilities and computer systems. This exposure includes unauthorized access to sensitive information; malicious damage to our facilities, infrastructure, and computer systems; malicious damage to third-party facilities, infrastructure, and computer systems; safety exposure for our employees and contractors; and disruptions of our operations. Cyber-security exposures in particular are fluid and adaptive, and include malicious software, unauthorized access to confidential data and disruptions to operations that use computers and data systems. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to reduce these exposures, there can be no assurances that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent such events from occurring. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Any of these security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of members of our senior management could adversely affect us.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management. The loss of the services of any of our senior management, including Tracy W. Krohn, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie L. Vazquez, our President; John D. Gibbons, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Thomas P. Murphy, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operations Officer; Stephen L. Schroeder, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer; and Thomas F. Getten, our Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, could have a negative impact on our operations. We do not maintain or plan to obtain for the benefit of the Company any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. Please read Executive Officers of the Registrant under Part I following Item 3 in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our senior management team.\nThe unavailability or high cost of certain types of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nThe U.S. oil and natural gas industry may experience shortages in the availability of certain types of drilling rigs or experience drilling rigs with high costs in relation to the recent change in price of crude oil and natural gas. This could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If the unavailability or high cost of rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel were particularly severe in the offshore waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico or Texas, we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in those areas.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nLegislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for United States production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nIt is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and production, and any such change could have a negative effect on the results of our operations.\nCounterparty credit risk may negatively impact the conversion of our accounts receivables to cash.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from oil, NGLs and natural gas sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by any adverse changes in economic or other conditions. In recent years, market conditions resulting in downgrades to credit ratings of energy merchants affected the liquidity of several of our purchasers.\nRisks Related to Financings\nAdverse changes in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our economic growth. In addition, the continuation of the current commodity price environment, or further declines of oil, NGLs and natural gas prices can affect our ability to obtain funding on acceptable terms or under our current credit facility. These impacts may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs and may restrict or limit our ability to increase reserves of oil and natural gas.\nThe capital markets we have historically accessed are currently constrained, but we believe we could access other capital markets if the need arises. These limitations in the capital markets may affect our ability to grow and limit our ability to replace our reserves of oil and gas.\nDuring 2012 and 2011, world financial markets were affected by the instability of the Euro and the uncertainty of some Euro-based countries to repay their debt. In addition, one credit agency downgraded the debt of the U.S. government. These types of events bring uncertainty to the financial markets and may produce volatility and may decrease financing availability. For example, in 2009, the global financial markets and economic conditions were severely distressed. There were concerns, both with respect to bank failures and bank liquidity, as to whether our banks would be able to meet their commitments under credit arrangements in place during that time. These concerns led to very few financing transactions being completed.\nOur revolving bank credit facility is subject to a semi-annual borrowing base re-determination, and available credit could be reduced or eliminated at the sole discretion of the banks within the facility. Our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, or the issuance of new indebtedness. We cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms.\nIf funding is not available as needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due and could be required to repay any borrowings in excess of the redetermined borrowing base, or we may be unable to implement our exploratory and development plan, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations.\nWe expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to the cyclical nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. In addition, our future cash flow may become insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay off our outstanding indebtedness. Many of these factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy or initiatives by our competitors, are beyond our control.\nIf we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our current or any future debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u00b7\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u00b7\nselling assets;\n\u00b7\nreducing or delaying capital investments; and\n\u00b7\nseeking to raise additional capital.\nAny alternative financing plans that we undertake, if necessary, may not allow us to meet our debt obligations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt obligations could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital requirements and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets;\n\u00b7\nlimit our opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt obligations or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt obligations;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; and\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with the covenants or other terms of any agreements governing our debt, our lenders will have the right to accelerate the maturity of that debt and foreclose upon the collateral, if any, securing that debt. Assuming continuing oil and gas prices near levels realized in December 2014 and January 2015, we likely will be out of compliance with certain of our financial ratio maintenance covenants under our Credit Agreement sometime during 2015. We intend to engage the lenders under the Credit Agreement in discussions regarding amending our financial ratio covenants at such time as our borrowing base is next redetermined, but we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such an amendment. While we believe we will obtain the appropriate covenant relief, if we are unable to obtain such an amendment from our lenders, we believe that we can find alternative financing, albeit at a higher cost, and we may have to reduce our cash outlays further for capital expenditures and other activities until such time as market conditions recover. Realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Principal Shareholder, Tracy W. Krohn\nWe will be controlled by Tracy W. Krohn as long as he owns a majority of our outstanding common stock, and other shareholders will be unable to affect the outcome of shareholder voting during that time. This control may adversely affect the value of our common stock and inhibit potential changes of control.\nTracy W. Krohn owns and controls 39,876,501 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 52.5% of our voting interests as of February 15, 2015. As a result, Mr. Krohn has the ability to control the outcome of matters that require a simple majority of shareholders for approval and other investors, by themselves, will not be able to affect the outcome of virtually any shareholder vote. Mr. Krohn, subject to any duty owed to our minority shareholders under Texas law, is able to control all matters affecting us, including:\n\u00b7\nthe composition of our board of directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers;\n\u00b7\nthe determination of incentive compensation, which may affect our ability to retain key employees;\n\u00b7\nany determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations;\n\u00b7\nour acquisition or disposition of assets;\n\u00b7\nour financing decisions and our capital raising activities;\n\u00b7\nour payment of dividends on our common stock, subject to the restrictions in our Credit Agreement and indentures; and\n\u00b7\namendments to our amended and restated articles of incorporation or bylaws.\nMr. Krohn is generally not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party. In addition, his concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that might be beneficial to our business or shareholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nDue to Mr. Krohn\u2019s ownership and control, we are exempted from many New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) corporate governance rules, and, as a result, our other shareholders may not have the protections set forth in those rules, particularly in the event of conflicts of interest with Mr. Krohn.\nMr. Krohn owns a majority of our common stock, and, therefore, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE. As such, we are not required to comply with certain corporate governance rules of the NYSE that would otherwise apply to us as a listed company on that exchange. These rules are generally intended to increase the likelihood that boards will make decisions in the best interests of shareholders. Should the interests of Mr. Krohn differ from those of other shareholders, the other shareholders will not be afforded the protections of having all of the other directors on the board being independent from our principal shareholder.", "PERMNO": 90533, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "WTI"}
