{"cik": "1056288", "company": "FEDERATED INVESTORS INC /PA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAs an investment manager, risk is an inherent part of Federated's business. U.S. and global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks involved in Federated's business. Additional risks not presently known to Federated or that Federated currently considers to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of a Material Concentration in Revenue. For 2015, approximately 46% of Federated's total revenue was attributable to equity assets as compared to 45% and 37% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in the relative proportion of Federated's revenue attributable to equity assets from 2014 to 2015 was primarily the result of higher average equity assets due to net sales. The change in the relative proportion of Federated's revenue attributable to equity assets from 2013 to 2014 was primarily the result of higher average equity assets due to net sales and, to a lesser extent, market appreciation. For 2015, approximately 33% of Federated's total revenue was attributable to money market assets as compared to\n32% and 39% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in the relative proportion of Federated's revenue attributable to money market assets from 2014 to 2015 was primarily the result of a decrease in Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers partially offset by lower average money market assets. The change in the relative proportion of Federated's revenue attributable to money market assets from 2013 to 2014 was primarily the result of lower average money market assets and increases in Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers, as well as the increase in average equity assets. A significant change in Federated's investment management business (such as its money market business) or a significant reduction in AUM (such as money market assets) due to regulatory changes or developments, changes in the financial markets, such as significant and rapid increases in interest rates over a short period of time causing certain investors to prefer direct investments in interest-bearing securities, the availability, supply and/or market interest in repurchase agreements and other investments, significant deterioration in investor confidence, a return to declining or additional prolonged periods of low short-term interest rates and resulting fee waivers, investor preferences for deposit products or other FDIC-insured products, or passive investment products, changes in relationships with financial intermediaries, or other circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Low Short-Term Interest Rates. In December 2015, the FOMC increased the federal funds target rate range by 25 basis points to 0.25%-0.50%, slightly raising short-term interest rates late in the year. The federal funds target rate, which drives short-term interest rates, had been near zero for nearly seven years. As a result of the long-term near-zero interest-rate environment, the gross yield earned by certain money market funds is not sufficient to cover all of the fund's operating expenses. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, Federated has experienced Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. These fee waivers have been partially offset by related reductions in distribution expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of Federated's mutual understanding and agreement with third-party intermediaries to share the impact of the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. In addition, while increases in short-term interest rates generally have the effect of decreasing these fee waivers for certain money market funds, the corresponding increases in yields and the resulting decrease in fee waivers are not certain nor directly proportional.\nThese Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers are calculated as a percentage of AUM in certain money market funds and thus will vary depending upon the asset levels in such funds. In addition, the level of waivers are dependent on several other factors including, but not limited to, yields on instruments available for purchase by the money market funds, changes in expenses of the money market funds and changes in the mix of money market assets. In any given period, a combination of these factors drives the amount of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. As an isolated variable, an increase in yields on instruments held by the money market funds will cause the pre-tax impact of fee waivers to decrease. Conversely, as an isolated variable, an increase in expenses of the money market funds would cause the pre-tax impact of fee waivers to increase.\nWith regard to asset mix, changes in the relative amount of money market fund assets in prime and government money market funds (or between such funds and other money market funds or other products) as well as the mix among certain share classes that vary in pricing structure will impact the level of fee waivers. Generally, prime money market funds waive less than government money market funds as a result of higher gross yields on the underlying investments. As such, as an isolated variable, an increase in the relative proportion of average managed assets invested in prime money market funds as compared to total average money market fund assets should typically result in lower Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. Conversely, the opposite would also be true.\nThe impact of such fee waivers on various components of Federated's Consolidated Statements of Income was as follows for the years ended December 31:\nThe negative pre-tax impact of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of higher yields on instruments held by the money market funds and, to a lesser extent, by a decrease in average money market assets. During 2014, the negative pre-tax impact of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers increased compared to 2013 primarily as a result of lower yields on instruments held by the money market funds, partially offset by a decrease in average\nmoney market assets. See Note (19) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the quarterly pre-tax impact of these fee waivers.\nOn December 16, 2015, the FOMC increased the federal funds target rate range by 25 basis points to 0.25% - 0.50% slightly raising short-term interest rates late in the year. While the FOMC implied in its economic projections that it would continue to raise the federal funds target rate in a measured and gradual way, Federated is unable to predict when, or to what extent, the FOMC will further increase their target for the federal funds rate. As such, Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers and the related reduction in distribution expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests could continue for the foreseeable future. Assuming asset levels and mix remain constant and based on recent market conditions, Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers for the first quarter of 2016 may result in a negative pre-tax impact on income of approximately $11 million, which is less than the impact to each quarter included in 2015 (see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Business Developments - Low Short-Term Interest Rates for additional information on management's expectations regarding fee waivers and Note (19) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the quarterly impact of these fee waivers). Any potential waiver recovery may be partially offset by changes in customer relationships or arrangements, among other potential factors. An expected change in a customer relationship may reduce pre-tax income by up to $6 million per quarter beginning in late 2016. Collectively, the net impact could result in approximately $5 million of net waiver recovery per quarter after 2016. See additional information in Item 9B - Other Information. While the level of these fee waivers are impacted by various factors, increases in short-term interest rates that result in higher yields on securities purchased in money market fund portfolios would likely reduce the negative pre-tax impact of these waivers. Excluding the possible impact of this customer relationship change, management estimates that an increase of 25 basis points in gross yields on securities purchased in money market fund portfolios will likely reduce the negative pre-tax impact of these waivers to approximately $4 million per quarter and an increase of 50 basis points could reduce the impact to approximately $1 million per quarter. An increase of 75 basis points could nearly eliminate these waivers. The actual amount of future fee waivers, the resulting negative impact of these waivers and Federated's ability to recover the net pre-tax impact of such waivers (that is, the ability to capture the pre-tax impact going forward, not re-capture previously waived amounts) could vary significantly from management's estimates as they are contingent on a number of variables including, but not limited to, changes in assets within the money market funds, yields on instruments available for purchase by the money market funds, actions by the Governors, the FOMC, the Treasury Department, the SEC, FSOC and other governmental entities, changes in fees and expenses of the money market funds, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in customer relationships, changes in money market product structures and offerings, demand for competing products, changes in distribution models, changes in the distribution fee arrangements with third parties, Federated's willingness to continue the fee waivers and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by any one or more third parties. The continuation, duration, level and impact of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers, as well as Federated's ability to recover the net pre-tax impact of such waivers (that is, the ability to capture the pre-tax income going forward, not re-capture previously waived amounts) as money market yields increase, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Rising Interest Rates. Despite the expectation that further increases in short-term interest rates above the current low rate range of 0.25% - 0.50% will further reduce the impact of the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers, increases in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on Federated's revenue from money market and other fixed-income products and strategies. In a rising short-term interest rate environment, certain investors using money market products and strategies or other short-term duration fixed-income products and strategies for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other products or strategies holding lower-yielding instruments. In addition, rising interest rates will tend to reduce the fair value of securities held in various investment products and strategies. Among other potential adverse effects, rising interest rates may result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility in financial markets and could negatively impact the performance of Federated's products and strategies and Federated's revenue. Management cannot estimate the impact of rising interest rates (including, for example on Federated's revenue), but such impact could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of a Decline or Disruption in the Economy or Financial Markets. Economic or financial market downturns, disruptions or other conditions (domestic or international) may cause volatility, illiquidity and other potential adverse effects in the financial markets and adversely affect, potentially in a material way, the supply of investments, such as money market or municipal (tax-exempt) securities and the profitability and performance of, demand for and investor confidence in Federated's investment products and strategies. Such economic or financial market downturns, disruptions or other conditions (domestic or international) may include, for example, disruptions in the securities and credit markets, defaults or poor performance in certain sectors of the economy, unemployment, the commencement, continuation or ending of government policies and reforms, stimulus programs and other market-related actions, changes in monetary policy, increased\nregulation, increases or decreases in interest rates, changes in oil prices, changes in currency values or exchange rates or currency abandonment, inflation or deflation, widening bid/ask spreads, changes in the allocation of capital to market-making, restructuring of government-sponsored entities, imposition of economic sanctions, economic or political weakness or instability in certain countries or regions, technology-related or cyber-attacks or incidents, terrorism, the prospects for or concerns about any of the foregoing factors or events, or other factors or events that affect the financial markets. Each of these factors, among others, may cause or contribute to such economic or financial market downturns, disruptions or other conditions and their potentially adverse effects. In addition, Federated's products and strategies may be adversely affected, potentially in a material way, by changes in U.S. markets, downgrades of U.S. credit ratings, the U.S. debt ceiling or other developments in the U.S., as well as by potential deterioration in international sovereign or currency market conditions.\nAt December 31, 2015, Federated's liquid assets of $367.4 million included investments in certain Federated-sponsored money market and fluctuating-value funds that may have direct and/or indirect exposures to international sovereign debt and currency risks. Federated and the money market and fluctuating NAV funds managed or distributed by Federated also interact with various other financial industry participants, such as counterparties, broker/dealers, banks, clearing organizations, other investment products and customers, as a result of operations, trading, distribution and other relationships. As a result, Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be adversely affected by the creditworthiness or financial soundness of other financial industry participants, particularly in times of economic or financial stress or disruption. There can be no assurance that potential losses that may be realized as a result of these exposures will not have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe ability of Federated to compete and sustain asset and revenue growth is dependent, in part, on the relative attractiveness of the types of investment products and strategies Federated offers and its investment performance under prevailing market conditions. Adverse market conditions or other events also could impact Federated's customers. In the event of extreme circumstances, such as economic, political, or business crises, Federated's products and strategies may suffer significant net redemptions in AUM causing severe liquidity issues in its short-term sponsored investment products and strategies and declines in the value of and returns on AUM, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nCustody and portfolio accounting services for all of Federated's mutual fund products are outsourced to one of four third-party financial institutions that are leading providers of such mutual fund services. Accounting records for Federated's mutual funds are maintained by these service providers (or vendors). These service providers, or other service providers of Federated and its products or customers, could also be adversely affected by the adverse market conditions described above. It is not possible to predict with certainty the extent to which the services or products Federated receives from such service providers would be interrupted or affected by such situations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that potential service interruption or Federated's ability to find a suitable replacement would not have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Changes in Laws, Regulations and Other Rules on Federated's Investment Management Business. Federated and its investment management business are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and abroad. Federated and its products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies are subject to federal securities laws, principally the 1933 Act, 1934 Act, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, state laws regarding securities fraud and regulations or other rules promulgated by various regulatory authorities, or self-regulatory organizations or exchanges including, but not limited to, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). From time to time, the federal securities laws have been augmented substantially. For example, among other measures, Federated and its products and strategies have been impacted by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Patriot Act of 2001, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the Dodd-Frank Act. Federated and its domestic products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies, and any offshore products (such as offshore Federated Funds) and strategies to the extent offered in the U.S., continue to be primarily regulated by the SEC. Federated, and certain Federated Funds, are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA), due to certain Federated Funds investing in futures, swaps or certain other commodity interests in more than de minimis amounts. In addition, during the past several years regulators, self-regulatory organizations or exchanges such as the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NFA and NYSE have adopted other regulations, rules and amendments that have increased Federated's operating expenses and affected the conduct of its business, and may continue to do so. Federated and its products and strategies also are affected by certain regulations governing banks and other financial institutions. Federated's and its products' operations outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign laws and regulation by foreign regulatory or other authorities, such as the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for London-based operations, the Central Bank of Ireland for Dublin-based operations, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority for Frankfurt-based operations, and Ontario (and certain other provincial) Securities Commissions for Canadian operations.\nAdditional, or changes in, laws, regulations, rules, interpretations or governmental policies, both domestically and abroad, may increase compliance risk and operating expenses, including the costs associated with compliance. As Federated's business expands, the potential impact of such changes in laws, regulations, rules, interpretations or governmental policies, compliance and the risks and costs associated with compliance may increase.\nDomestically, in addition to other potential future regulation, the SEC, building on initial money market fund reforms adopted in 2010, adopted additional money market fund reforms in the form of the 2014 Money Fund Rules, the SEC staff issued related Money Fund Rules Guidance in 2015, and regulators, such as the SEC, Treasury Department, IRS, and DOL, among others, have issued or proposed Other Regulatory Developments (see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information on the 2014 Money Fund Rules, the Money Fund Rules Guidance and Other Regulatory Developments). In addition to promulgating additional regulation, regulators, such as the SEC, have undertaken or may undertake a series of investigations, enforcement actions and/or examinations involving investment management industry participants, including certain sweep examinations of investment management companies involving various topics, such as fixed-income and high yield liquidity, liquidity controls, liquid alternatives, cybersecurity, side-by-side management of private funds, private placements, separately managed or wrap-fee accounts, excessive trading, \"distribution in guise,\" and intermediary and other payments and related disclosures. Among other potential impacts, these regulatory requirements and developments have increased, or will likely increase, compliance risks, as well as costs associated with technology, legal, compliance, operations and other efforts to address regulatory-related matters, and caused, or may cause, product structure, pricing, offering and development effort adjustments, as well as changes in asset flows and customer relationships. These regulatory requirements and developments also could make certain money market fund products less attractive to institutional and other investors and/or result in reductions in AUM and revenues. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provided for a new systemic risk regulation regime under which it is possible that Federated, and/or any one or more of its products (such as the Federated Funds), could be subject to designation as a systemically important financial institution by the FSOC, thereby resulting in additional regulation by the Governors in addition to primary regulation by the SEC (see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the potential for heightened regulation by the Governors and the FSOC). Among other potential impacts, any such designation would subject the designated entity to enhanced banking-oriented measures, including, for example, capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, thereby increasing compliance risk and compliance costs.\nManagement believes that the floating NAV for institutional and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds will be detrimental to Federated's money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. On a cumulative basis, Federated's regulatory, product development and restructuring, and other efforts in response to the 2014 Money Fund Rules, Money Fund Rules Guidance, and Other Regulatory Developments, including the internal and external resources dedicated to such efforts, have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Federated's expenses and, in turn, financial performance. Given the 2014 Money Fund Rules, Money Fund Rules Guidance and Other Regulatory Developments, and the potential for future additional regulation or guidance, Federated is unable at this time to fully assess the degree of the impact of these regulatory requirements and developments, and Federated's related efforts, on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. These regulatory changes and developments, and Federated's efforts in responding to them, could have a material and adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated also is unable to assess whether, or the degree to which, any of the Federated Funds, including money market funds or any of its other products, could ultimately be designated a systemically important non-bank financial company by the FSOC. In management's view, the issuance of final regulations pertaining to systemically important non-bank financial companies is, and any reforms ultimately put into effect would be, detrimental to Federated's money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated also is unable to assess at this time whether, or the degree to which, any potential options being evaluated in connection with these regulatory requirements and developments ultimately may be successful.\nOutside of the U.S., international regulators and other authorities, such as the FCA and Central Bank of Ireland, also have adopted and proposed regulations that could increase Federated's operating expenses and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operation, financial condition and/or cash flows. In addition to other potential future regulation, European money market reform and the imposition of the FTT, particularly if enacted with broad application, would each be detrimental to Federated's fund business (see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding European money market reform and the FTT). Among other potential impacts, compliance risks, the cost of compliance and other operational expenses would likely increase, and certain money market fund products may become less attractive to institutional or other investors, which could result in reductions in AUM, revenues and operating income. The designation as a systemically important non-bank, non-insurance company by the FSB also could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows (see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory\nMatters for additional information regarding systemically important non-bank, non-insurance company designation). Among other potential impacts, any such designation would subject the designated entity to enhanced banking-oriented measures, including, for example, capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, thereby increasing compliance risk and compliance costs. Federated is unable to assess the degree of any potential impact that European money market reform proposals or the FTT, or the potential for future additional regulation or guidance, may have on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows until such proposals are finalized and approved, the FTT is enacted or Federated or a Federated Fund is designated as a systemically important non-bank, non-insurance company.\nChanges in laws, regulations, rules, interpretations or governmental policies, domestically and abroad, also impact the financial intermediaries, service providers (or vendors), customers and other third-parties with whom Federated, and its products (such as the Federated Funds), conduct business. For example, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or the DOL's proposed fiduciary rule may affect intermediaries in their sale or use of Federated's products or strategies. Among other potential impacts, this could affect Federated's arrangements with these intermediaries, increase fee pressure, increase respective operating expenses and distribution costs, result in lower AUM, change asset flows and otherwise affect the conduct of Federated's or such intermediaries' respective businesses. This also could result in Federated or one or more of these third parties seeking to restructure or alter their compensation or other terms of the business arrangements between Federated or its products (including the Federated Funds) and one or more of these third parties. The above factors could have a material adverse impact on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nVarious service industries, including, for example, mutual fund service providers, have been, and continue to be, the subject of changes in tax policy that impact their state and local tax liability. Changes that have been adopted or proposed include (1) an expansion of the nature of a service company's activities that subject it to tax in a jurisdiction, (2) a change in the methodology by which multi-state companies apportion their income between jurisdictions, and (3) a requirement that affiliated companies calculate their state tax as one combined entity. As adopted changes become effective and additional jurisdictions effect similar changes, among other potential impacts, there could be a material adverse effect on Federated's tax liability and effective tax rate and, as a result, net income. Various investment products also may be impacted by tax changes, which could have an adverse effect on the products and Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effect of Providing Financial Support to Investment Products. Federated may, from time to time, elect to provide financial support to its sponsored investment products (such as the Federated Funds). Providing such support utilizes capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRisk of Federated's Money Market Products' Ability to Maintain a Stable Net Asset Value. Approximately 33% of Federated's total revenue for 2015 was attributable to money market assets. An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed by the FDIC. Federated's money market funds seek to maintain a stable NAV. Although stable-value money market funds (including, after the 2014 Money Fund Rules become fully effective on October 14, 2016, retail and government money market funds) seek to preserve an NAV of $1.00 per share, it is possible for an investor to lose money by investing in these funds. Once Federated implements changes to its money fund product line up in response to the 2014 Money Fund Rules and offers institutional prime or municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds with NAVs of $1.0000 that can fluctuate, it also will be possible for an investor to lose money by investing in these funds. Federated devotes substantial resources, such as significant credit analysis to the management of its products and strategies. However, there is no guarantee that a stable value money market fund will be able to preserve a stable NAV in the future. Market conditions could lead to a limited supply of money market fund securities and severe liquidity issues and/or declines in interest rates or additional prolonged periods of low yields in money market products or strategies, and regulatory changes or developments could lead to shifts in asset levels and mix, which could impact money market fund NAVs and performance. If the NAV of a Federated stable-value money market fund (including, after the 2014 Money Fund Rules become fully effective on October 14, 2016, a retail and government money market fund) were to decline to less than $1.00 per share, such Federated money market fund would likely experience significant redemptions, resulting in reductions in AUM, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. It is also possible that, if (after the 2014 Money Fund Rules become fully effective on October 14, 2016) an institutional prime or municipal (or tax-exempt) money market fund's fluctuating NAV consistently or significantly declines to less than $1.0000 per share, such Federated money market fund could experience significant redemptions, resulting in reductions in AUM, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nNo Assurance of Access to Sufficient Liquidity. From time to time, Federated's operations may require more cash than is available from operations. In these circumstances, it may be necessary to borrow from lending facilities or to raise capital by securing new debt or by selling shares of Federated equity or debt securities. Federated's ability to raise additional capital in the future will be affected by several factors including, for example, Federated's creditworthiness and the fair value of Federated's common stock, as well as general market conditions. There can be no assurance that Federated will be able to obtain these funds and financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if Federated cannot obtain such funds, it could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRecruiting and Retaining Key Personnel. Federated's ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to its growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining customers. The market for qualified executives, portfolio managers, analysts, traders, sales representatives and other key personnel is extremely competitive. There can be no assurance that Federated will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel. In addition to competing opportunities, personnel elect to pursue other interests for business, personal and other reasons or retire from time to time. Federated has encouraged the continued retention of its executives and other key personnel through measures such as providing competitive compensation arrangements and, in certain cases, employment agreements. The loss of any such personnel could have an adverse effect on Federated. In certain circumstances, the departure of key employees could cause higher redemption rates for certain AUM or the loss of customer accounts. Moreover, since certain of Federated's products and strategies contribute significantly to its revenues and earnings, the loss of even a small number of key personnel associated with these products or strategies could have a disproportionate adverse impact, potentially in a material way, on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nVarious executives, investment, sales and other key personnel own restricted stock subject to vesting periods of up to ten years from the date awarded and to provisions that require resale or forfeiture to Federated in certain circumstances upon termination of employment. In addition, certain of these employees are employed under contracts which require periodic review of compensation and contain restrictive covenants with regard to divulging confidential information and engaging in competitive activities.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Increased Competition in the Investment Management Business. The investment management business is highly competitive. Federated competes in the management and distribution of investment products and strategies (such as mutual funds and Separate Accounts) with other fund management companies and investment advisers, national and regional broker/dealers, commercial banks, insurance companies and other institutions. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than Federated. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, quality of service, the strength and continuity of management and selling relationships, distribution services offered, the type (e.g. passive versus actively managed, fund versus FDIC-insured deposits) and range of products and strategies offered and fees charged. As with any highly competitive market, competitive pricing structures are important. If competitors charge lower fees for similar products or strategies, Federated may decide to reduce the fees on its own products or strategies (either directly on a gross basis or on a net basis through fee waivers) in order to retain or attract customers. Such fee reductions, or other effects of competition, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nMany of Federated's products and strategies are designed for use by institutions such as banks, insurance companies and other corporations. A large portion of Federated's managed assets, particularly money market and fixed-income assets, are held by institutional investors. If or when the structure of institutional investment products, such as money market funds, changes or becomes disfavored by institutions, whether due to regulatory or market changes or otherwise, Federated may be unable to retain or grow its share of this market and this could adversely affect Federated's future profitability and have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nA significant portion of Federated's revenue is derived from providing products (such as mutual funds) and strategies to the wealth management and trust market, comprising approximately 2,500 banks and other financial institutions. Future profitability of Federated will be adversely affected if it is unable to retain or grow its share of this market, and could also be adversely affected by consolidations in the banking industry, as well as regulatory changes or developments impacting its customers.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Changes in Federated's Distribution Channels. Federated acts as a wholesaler of investment products and strategies to financial intermediaries, including, for example, banks, broker/dealers, registered investment advisers and other financial planners. Federated also sells investment products and strategies directly to corporations, institutions and other customers. There can be no assurance that Federated will continue to have access to any financial intermediary or financial intermediaries that currently distribute Federated products and strategies or that Federated's relationship with any one\nor more financial intermediaries will continue over time or on existing economic terms. The impact of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers and related reductions in distribution expense can vary depending upon, among other variables, changes in distribution models, changes in the distribution fee arrangements with one or more financial intermediaries, changes in customer relationships and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by one or more financial intermediaries. In addition, exclusive of the impacts of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers and related reductions in distribution expense, Federated has experienced increases in the cost of distribution as a percentage of total revenue from 31% in 2007 to over 38% in 2015. Federated expects such costs to continue to increase in total due to asset growth, and per dollar of revenue due to the competitive pressures of the investment management business. Higher distribution costs reduce Federated's operating and net income.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Declines in the Amount of or Changes in the Mix of Assets Under Management. A significant portion of Federated's revenue is derived from investment advisory fees, which are based on the value of managed assets and vary with the type of asset being managed, with higher fees generally earned on equity products and strategies than on fixed-income and money market products and strategies. Likewise, mutual fund and other fund products generally have a higher management-fee rate than Separate Accounts. Additionally, certain components of distribution expense can vary depending upon the asset class, distribution channel and/or the size or structure of the customer relationship. Consequently, significant fluctuations in the value of securities held by, or the level of redemptions from, the products (such as the Federated Funds) or strategies advised by Federated may materially affect the amount of managed assets and thus Federated's revenue, profitability and growth. Similarly, changes in Federated's average asset mix across both asset and product or strategy types have a direct impact on Federated's revenue and profitability. Federated generally pays out a larger portion of the revenue earned from managed assets in money market funds than the revenue earned from managed assets in equity or fixed-income funds. Substantially all of Federated's managed assets are in investment products or strategies that permit investors to redeem or withdraw their investment at any time. Additionally, changing market conditions may cause a shift in Federated's asset mix towards money market and fixed-income products or strategies, and regulatory changes or developments may cause a shift between money fund products or from money market funds to other products, which may cause a decline in or otherwise affect, potentially in a material way, Federated's revenue and net income.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Poor Investment Performance. Success in the investment management business is largely dependent on investment performance relative to market conditions and the performance of competing products and strategies. Good performance generally assists retention and growth of managed assets, resulting in additional revenues. Conversely, poor performance tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in revenues to Federated. Poor performance could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Market conditions, such as volatility, illiquidity and rising interest rates, among other conditions, can adversely affect the performance of certain quantitative or other investment strategies or certain products, asset classes or sectors. The effects of poor performance on Federated could be magnified where assets or customers are concentrated in certain strategies, products, asset classes or sectors. In terms of revenue concentration by product, approximately 11% of Federated's total revenue for 2015 was derived from services provided to a sponsored fund, the Federated Kaufmann Fund. A significant and prolonged decline in the AUM in this fund could have a material adverse effect on Federated's future revenues and net income.\nOperational Risks. Federated's and its products'/business' operations are supported internally and through management of relationships with various third party service providers (or vendors), both domestically and internationally. In turn, service providers' operations rely on additional relationships with other third parties. Operational risks include, but are not limited to, improper, inefficient, or unauthorized execution, processing, pricing and/or monitoring of transactions, deficiencies in operating systems, business disruptions, inadequacies or breaches in Federated's, its products' or a service provider's internal control processes, unauthorized disclosure of confidential, proprietary or non-public personal information and noncompliance with regulatory requirements. As Federated's and its relevant service providers' businesses expand and require additional scalability, operational risk increases both domestically and internationally. Management relies on its employees, systems and business continuity plans, and those of relevant service providers, to comply with established procedures, controls and regulatory requirements. Breakdown or improper use of systems, human error or improper action by employees or service providers, or noncompliance with regulations or other rules, could cause material adverse effects on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nNo Assurance of Successful Acquisitions. Federated's business strategy contemplates the acquisition of other investment management companies, as well as investment assets, both domestically and internationally. There can be no assurance that Federated will find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices, have sufficient capital resources to realize its acquisition strategy, be successful in entering into definitive agreements for or consummating desired acquisitions, or successfully\nintegrating acquired companies or assets into Federated, or its products or strategies, or that any such acquisitions, if consummated, will prove to be advantageous to Federated.\nImpairment Risk. At December 31, 2015, Federated had intangible assets including goodwill totaling $734.5 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, the vast majority of which represents assets capitalized in connection with Federated's acquisitions and business combinations. Federated may not realize the value of these assets. Management performs an annual review of the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and periodic reviews of the carrying values of all other assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of an asset to become impaired. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the asset would occur, resulting in a noncash charge which would adversely affect Federated's financial position and results of operations for the period.\nSystems, Technology and Cybersecurity Risks. Federated utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business (both domestically and internationally) including, for example, both proprietary systems and those provided by outside service providers (or vendors). Service providers to, and customers of, Federated and its products, and third parties on which such service providers and customers rely, also utilize software and related technologies in their businesses. Unanticipated issues could occur and it is not possible to predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from a failure of Federated or a third party to address computer system problems. Along with cyber incidents described more fully below, data or model imprecision, software or other technology malfunctions, human error, programming inaccuracies and similar or other circumstances or events may impair the performance of systems and technology. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that potential system interruptions, other technology-related issues or the cost necessary to rectify the problems would not have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, like other companies in the investment management industry and elsewhere, the use of the Internet and other electronic media and technology exposes Federated, its business, its products and services, customers, and relevant service providers, and their respective operations, to potential risks from frequent cybersecurity attacks, events or incidents (cyber incidents). For example, Federated and relevant service providers collect, maintain and transmit confidential, proprietary and non-public personal customer information (such as in connection with online account access and performing investment, reconciliation, transfer agent, custodian and other recordkeeping and related functions) that can be targeted by cyber incidents. Cyber incidents may include, for example, unauthorized access to systems, networks or devices (for example, through hacking activity), infection from or spread of malware, computer viruses or other malicious software code, corruption of data, and attacks (including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks on websites) which shut down, disable, slow, impair or otherwise disrupt operations, business processes, technology, connectivity or website or internet access, functionality or performance. Like other companies, Federated has experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber-incidents consistently. For example, Federated recently detected malware on certain systems and equipment and devoted internal and external resources to the matter. Cyber incidents have not had a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In addition to intentional cyber incidents, unintentional cyber incidents can occur (for example, the inadvertent release of confidential or non-public personal information). A cyber incident may cause Federated, its business, products or services, its employees, customers, or relevant service providers, to lose proprietary, sensitive, confidential or non-public business, customer or personal information, suffer data corruption or business interruption, lose operational capacity (for example, the loss of the ability to process transactions, calculate NAV, or allow the transaction of business), and/or fail to comply with applicable privacy and other laws. Among other potentially harmful effects, cyber incidents also may result in theft, unauthorized monitoring and failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems. Any cyber incident could cause adverse impacts, the occurrence of financial losses, expenses and exposure related to regulatory penalties, litigation, reputational damage, and additional compliance costs associated with protection, detection, remediation and corrective measures. Cyber incidents affecting issuers in which Federated's or its customers' assets are invested also could cause such investments to lose value. Any of these cyber incidents may become incrementally worse if they were to remain undetected for an extended period of time.\nThe operating systems of Federated, its products, its customers and relevant service providers are dependent on the effectiveness of information security policies and procedures which seek to ensure that such systems are protected from cyber incidents. Federated has, and believes its products and its service providers have, established risk management systems that are reasonably designed to seek to reduce the risks associated with cyber incidents, however, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful, either entirely or partially. Among other reasons, the nature of malicious cyber incidents is becoming increasingly sophisticated and Federated, and its relevant affiliates and products, cannot control the systems and cybersecurity systems of issuers, relevant service providers or other third parties. While Federated cannot predict the financial or reputational impact to its business resulting from any cyber incident, the occurrence of a cyber incident, or a similar situation or incident,\ncould have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Reputational Harm. Any material losses in customer (including shareholder) confidence in Federated, its products or strategies or in the mutual fund industry as a result of actual or potential regulatory proceedings or litigation, economic or financial market downturns or disruptions, material errors in public news reports, misconduct, a cyber incident, rumors on the Internet or other matters could increase redemptions from and/or reduce sales of Federated's products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies and other investment management products and services. If such losses were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Termination or Failure to Renew Fund Agreements. A substantial majority of Federated's revenues are derived from investment management agreements with sponsored mutual funds (and to a lesser extent, sub-advised mutual funds) that, as required by law, are terminable upon 60 days' notice. In addition, each such investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by each mutual fund's board of directors or trustees, including independent members of the board, or its shareholders, as required by law. Failure to renew, changes resulting in lower fees under, or termination of certain or a significant number of, these agreements could have a material adverse impact on Federated. As required by the 1940 Act, each investment advisory agreement with a mutual fund automatically terminates upon its assignment, although new investment advisory agreements may be approved by the mutual fund's directors or trustees and shareholders. A sale or other transfer of a sufficient number of shares of Federated's voting securities to transfer control of Federated could be deemed an assignment in certain circumstances. An assignment, actual or constructive, will trigger these termination provisions and may adversely affect Federated's ability to realize the value of these agreements. Federated investment advisory contracts for Separate Accounts that are not investment companies subject to the 1940 Act generally are terminable by Federated's customers upon notice to Federated (or, in certain cases, after a 30 day, 60 day or similar notice period). As required by the Advisers Act, investment advisory agreements for Separate Accounts that are not investment companies subject to the 1940 Act also provide that consent is required from Federated's customers before the agreements may be assigned and an assignment, actual or constructive, also will trigger these consent requirements and may adversely affect Federated's ability to realize the value of these agreements.\nUnder the terms of a 2005 settlement agreement with the SEC and New York State Attorney General, a Federated investment advisory subsidiary may not serve as investment adviser to any registered investment company unless: (1) at least 75% of the fund's directors are independent of Federated; (2) the chairman of each such fund is independent of Federated; (3) no action may be taken by the fund's board of directors or trustees or any committee thereof unless approved by a majority of the independent board members of the fund or committee, respectively; and (4) the fund appoints a senior officer who reports to the independent directors or trustees and is responsible for monitoring compliance by the fund with applicable laws and fiduciary duties and for managing the process by which management fees charged to a fund are approved.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Unpredictable Events. Unpredictable events, such as a natural disaster, pandemic, war and terrorist attack, could adversely impact Federated's, its customer's and their respective service providers' (or vendors') ability to conduct business. Such events could cause disruptions in economic conditions and financial markets, system interruption, loss of life, unavailability of personnel or additional costs. As such, there can be no assurance that unpredictable events, or the costs to address such events, would not have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Litigation, Investigations, Proceedings and Other Claims. Federated can be subject to routine, sweep and other examinations, inquiries, investigations, proceedings (administrative, regulatory, civil or otherwise) and other claims by its regulators (regulatory claims). Federated also can be subject to customer, and other third-party, complaints, proceedings (such as civil litigation) and other claims (business-related claims). Among other factors, as Federated's business, products and strategies expand, and financial products and other investments, markets and technology increase in complexity, the attention and resources that Federated devotes to compliance increases and the possibility and occurrences of non-compliance may increase. Federated has business-related claims asserted and threatened against it, and is subject to certain regulatory claims (such as routine and sweep examinations and other inquiries), in the ordinary course of business. In addition, Federated may be subject to business-related claims, and administrative, regulatory or civil investigations and proceedings or other regulatory claims, outside of the ordinary course of business. Federated cannot assess or predict whether, when or what types of business-related claims or regulatory claims (collectively, claims) may be threatened or asserted, the types or amounts of damages or other remedies that may be sought (which may be material when threatened or asserted), whether claims that have been threatened will become formal asserted pending investigations, proceedings or litigation, or whether claims ultimately may be successful (whether through settlement or adjudication), entirely or in part, whether or not any such claims\nare threatened or asserted in or outside the ordinary course of business. Federated may be initially unable to accurately assess a claim's impact. Given that the outcome of any claim is inherently unpredictable and uncertain, a result may arise from time to time that adversely impacts, potentially in a material way, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In certain circumstances, insurance coverage may not be available or deductible amounts may not be exceeded, and Federated may have to bear the costs related to claims or any losses or other liabilities resulting from any such matters, or from the operation of Federated's business, products and services generally.\nFederated's Status as a \"Controlled Company.\" Federated has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock, which has voting power, and Class B Common Stock, which is non-voting except in certain limited circumstances. All of the outstanding shares of Federated's Class A Common Stock are held by the Voting Shares Irrevocable Trust for the benefit of certain members of the family of John F. Donahue. The three trustees of this trust are Mr. John F. Donahue, the Chairman of Federated's board of directors, his wife, and his son, Mr. J. Christopher Donahue, who is Federated's President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a director. Accordingly, Federated qualifies as a \"controlled company\" under Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. As a controlled company, Federated qualifies for and relies upon exemptions from several NYSE corporate governance requirements, including requirements that: (1) a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors; and (2) the entity maintains a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities. As a result, Federated's board does not have a majority of independent directors nor does it maintain a nominating/corporate governance committee. Federated is also exempt as a \"controlled company\" from certain additional independence requirements and responsibilities regarding compensation advisers applicable to Compensation Committee members.", "PERMNO": 86102, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "FHI"}
