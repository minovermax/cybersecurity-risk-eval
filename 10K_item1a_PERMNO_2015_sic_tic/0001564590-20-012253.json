{"cik": "1293818", "company": "OPGEN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are significant factors known to us that could materially harm our business, financial condition or operating results or could cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statement made in this Annual Report. The risks described are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and operating results could suffer significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses, and we expect to incur losses for the next several years. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 contains explanatory language that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred substantial losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur additional losses for the next several years. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had net losses of $12.4 million and $13.4 million, respectively. From our inception through December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $174.5 million. The reports of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 each contain explanatory language that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern. We completed a number of financings in 2019 and 2018, including the October 2019 Public Offering, March 2019 Public Offering, October 2018 Public Offering, February 2018 Public Offering, and an at-the-market, or ATM, public offering commenced in September 2016 and terminated in October 2018. The net proceeds from such financings were approximately $27.2 million. We began raising capital under the 2020 ATM Offering in February 2020. We cannot assure you that we can continue to raise the capital necessary to fund our business.\nWe need to raise equity capital to support our business and that of Curetis under the Interim Facility. If we cannot do so successfully, we will not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe need to raise equity capital to support our business and that of Curetis under the Interim Facility. If we cannot do so successfully, we will not be able to continue as a going concern. To meet our capital needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, the ATM Offering, additional equity financings, debt financings and other funding transactions, licensing and/or partnering arrangements and business combination transactions. We believe that additional equity financings are the most likely source of capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such financing transaction on acceptable terms or otherwise.\nWe believe that current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations into the third quarter of 2020. In the event we are unable to successfully raise additional capital during or before the third quarter of 2020, we will not have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to finance our business operations as currently contemplated. Accordingly, in such circumstances we would be compelled to immediately reduce general and administrative expenses and delay research and development projects, including the purchase of scientific equipment and supplies, until we are able to obtain sufficient financing. If such sufficient financing is not received timely, we would then need to pursue a plan to license or sell assets, seek to be acquired by another entity, cease operations and/or seek bankruptcy protection.\nIn July 2015, in connection with our acquisition of our subsidiary, AdvanDx, MGHIF made investments in the Company, including the $1 million MGHIF Note, secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property assets. The debt is due to be paid in six semi-annual payments of $166,667 which began on January 2, 2019 and will end on July 1, 2021. Such secured creditor rights could negatively impact our ability to raise money in the future. If we default on payments under the\nMGHIF Note, MGHIF has the rights of a secured creditor. If those rights are exercised, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in consummating the proposed transaction with Curetis N.V., which failure could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe proposed combination with Curetis is subject to the approval of our stockholders and MGHIF, and we cannot provide any assurance that stockholder approval will be obtained. The shareholders and debt holders of Curetis N.V. and Curetis GmbH have approved the transaction. We did not have a quorum for our special meeting of stockholders and have had to postpone the meeting until March 30, 2020. If the proposed transaction is not approved by our stockholders, we may become liable to reimburse Curetis N.V. for its expenses up to a maximum amount of $250,000. In case of termination of the Implementation Agreement in accordance with its terms, Curetis would also be required to repay us under the Interim Facility, and we would need to re-focus our attention on OpGen as a stand-alone business. Any of these events would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe have agreed to use a significant portion of the capital raised in the October 2019 Public Offering and in the 2020 ATM Offering to support the operations of Curetis in the period prior to the closing. This reduces the proceeds invested in OpGen\u2019s operations, which could have a negative impact on us if the proposed transaction is not consummated, or if the approval process takes longer than anticipated.\nPursuant to the Implementation Agreement, on November 12, 2019, we entered into the Interim Facility pursuant to which we have agreed to lend to Curetis GmbH up to $4 million of the proceeds of the October 2019 Public Offering and the 2020 ATM Offering to fund and support the operations, and satisfy the current obligations, of Curetis in the period prior to closing. On March 18, 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Interim Facility, which increased the available borrowings by Curetis GmbH to $5 million. If such period extends for a longer period than anticipated or the amount loaned to Curetis is higher than expected, such commitment could negatively impact the availability of resources to devote to the OpGen business or to the business of Newco if the closing occurs, and we may be required to raise additional capital.\nIf the transaction contemplated by the Implementation Agreement does not close, we anticipate that it will be difficult for Curetis to repay us under the Interim Facility, if at all. Any unanticipated loans under the Interim Facility, or failure to be repaid under the Interim Facility would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf the combination with Curetis does not occur, our financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nIf we cannot meet all of the conditions to close under the Implementation Agreement, and the business combination does not occur, we will be in a difficult financial position. We will have lent funds to Curetis under the Interim Facility, and there is a real possibility that Curetis would not be able to repay us some or all of such debt. In addition, we would have to refocus our attention on OpGen as a stand-alone business and would likely need to raise additional funds to support that business going forward. We cannot assure you that we would be able to continue OpGen as a stand-alone business or be able to raise sufficient capital to do so. If we are unable to raise equity capital, we may need to incur debt financing, if possible, sell assets, curtail business programs, seek bankruptcy protection or dissolve.\nWe will incur significant indebtedness as a result of the combination with Curetis, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf the combination with Curetis closes, we will assume the indebtedness of Curetis N.V. and Curetis. As of December 31, 2019, Curetis N.V. owed indebtedness of $1.4 million to lenders under the Curetis Convertible Notes and owed indebtedness of $20.3 million of principal (plus interest of $2.6 million) under a loan provided by the EIB. In addition, OpGen has secured indebtedness to MGHIF under the MGHIF Note. Pursuant to the Implementation Agreement, OpGen will be required to assume the indebtedness of Curetis N.V. (subject to approval of the holder of the Curetis Convertible Notes) and of Curetis, and Newco will therefore be obligated under substantially more indebtedness than OpGen currently owes. Newco may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under indebtedness that may not be successful. The inability in the future to repay such indebtedness when due would have a material adverse effect on Newco.\nWe have incurred significant transaction costs as a result of the proposed business combination transaction with Curetis, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have incurred significant one-time transaction costs related to the proposed business combination with Curetis. These transaction costs include legal and accounting fees and expenses and filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. We may also incur additional unanticipated transaction costs in connection with the transaction. A portion of the transaction costs related to the proposed business combination have been incurred regardless of whether the transaction is completed. Additional costs will be incurred in connection with integrating the two companies\u2019 businesses. Costs in connection with the transaction and integration may be higher than expected. These costs could adversely affect OpGen\u2019s financial condition, operating results or prospects of the combined company.\nThe proposed business combination transaction with Curetis will significantly change the business and operations of OpGen. We may face challenges integrating the businesses.\nFollowing the consummation of the proposed combination with Curetis, OpGen will continue as the operating entity and both the size and geographic scope of OpGen\u2019s business will significantly increase. Most of the Curetis business is currently conducted in Europe, Asia and other countries outside of the United States, and many of the Curetis employees are located outside of the United States. In addition, the majority of the initial board of directors will consist of individuals appointed by Curetis N.V., and we expect that the focus of Newco may shift to Curetis operations. We may face challenges integrating such geographically diverse businesses and implementing a smooth transition of business focus and governance in a timely or efficient manner. In particular, if the effort we devote to the integration of our businesses with that of Curetis diverts more management time or other resources from carrying out our operations than we originally planned, our ability to maintain and increase revenues as well as manage our costs could be impaired. Furthermore, our capacity to expand other parts of our existing businesses may be impaired. We also cannot assure you that the combination of the OpGen and Curetis businesses will function as we anticipate, or that significant synergies will result from the business combination. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nManagement and the board of directors of OpGen will change upon the consummation of the Transaction. We cannot assure you that this will not have a material impact on the Newco.\nThe current chief executive officer of Curetis N.V., Oliver Schacht, Ph.D., will be the chief executive officer of Newco, and Timothy C. Dec will continue to serve as chief financial officer. The Implementation Agreement provides that four members of the initial board of directors of Newco following the closing will be appointed by Curetis N.V. and two by the board of directors of OpGen. The parties have agreed to add a seventh director, to be recommended by OpGen, but that process has not started. Most of the current members of the management board of Curetis N.V. have experience serving on the boards of companies listed on Euronext and German prime standard companies, but not on U.S. publicly-listed companies and this could impact the transition of Newco.\nThe combination of the OpGen and Curetis businesses may not lead to the growth and success of the combined business that we believe will occur.\nAlthough we believe the combination of the OpGen and Curetis businesses provides a significant commercial opportunity for growth, we may not realize all of the synergies that we anticipate and may not be successful in implementing our commercialization strategy. Our combined business will be subject to all of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the pursuit of growth in our industry and we may not be able to successfully sell our products, obtain the regulatory clearances and approvals we apply for or, or realize the anticipated benefits from our distribution, collaboration and other commercial partners. If we are not able to grow the business of Newco as a commercial enterprise, our financial condition will be negatively impacted.\nIntegrating the businesses of OpGen and Curetis may disrupt or have a negative impact on Newco.\nWe could have difficulty integrating the assets, personnel and business of OpGen and Curetis. The proposed transaction is complex and we will need to devote significant time and resources to integrating the businesses. Risks that could impact us negatively include:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating the acquired companies, and their concepts and operations;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in combining our financial operations and reporting;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management;\n\u2022\nchanges in our business focus and/or management;\n\u2022\nrisks related to international operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel; and\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees.\nIf we are not successful in addressing these risks effectively, the business of Newco could be severely impaired.\nIf we or Curetis receive a proposal for an alternative transaction, and one of us accepts such proposal, the Transaction will not close.\nWe may be liable to pay Curetis N.V. a termination fee of $500,000 if our board of directors changes its recommendation to approve the proposed transaction at the special meeting, or if following a refusal by our stockholders to approve the proposed transaction at the special meeting, we enter into a definitive agreement implementing an alternative transaction with a third party. Curetis N.V. has undertaken the same obligations with respect to us if the boards of Curetis N.V. change their recommendation to approve the proposed transaction. Any such alternative transaction could divert the attention of our board of directors and management team, and would, if accepted, cause the termination of the Transaction.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses relating to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndeveloping our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel products and services for antibiotic resistance testing;\n\u2022\ncommercializing our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests and Acuitas Lighthouse informatics services, as RUO products and, once cleared, as diagnostic products and services;\n\u2022\nconducting additional clinical trials as we seek regulatory approval for some of our product offerings;\n\u2022\ndeveloping, presenting and publishing additional clinical and economic utility data intended to increase clinician adoption of our current and future products and services;\n\u2022\nexpanding our operating capabilities;\n\u2022\ndeveloping additional collaborative arrangements;\n\u2022\nmaintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio and trade secrets;\n\u2022\nexpanding the size and geographic reach of our sales force and our marketing capabilities to commercialize potential future products and services; and\n\u2022\nrecruiting and retaining our quality assurance and compliance personnel and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.\nEven if we achieve significant revenues, we may not become profitable, and even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain consistently profitable could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could significantly impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue to pursue our growth strategy. We believe that current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations into the third quarter of 2020. In the event we are unable to successfully raise additional capital during or before the third quarter of 2020, we will not have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to finance our business operations as currently contemplated. Accordingly, in such circumstances we would be compelled to reduce general and administrative expenses and delay research and development projects, including the purchase of scientific equipment and supplies, until we are able to obtain sufficient financing. We have no committed sources of capital and may find it difficult to raise money on terms favorable to us or at all. The failure to obtain sufficient capital to support our operations would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe process to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals for our products is complex and time-consuming. If we fail to obtain such clearances or approvals, our business and results of operations will be materially adversely impacted.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In May 2019, we filed a 510(k) submission with the FDA seeking clearance of our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Isolates) diagnostic test. In July 2019, we received correspondence from the FDA requesting additional information related to this filing. On January 6, 2020, OpGen filed a formal response to the FDA\u2019s July 2019 AI Request. Subsequently, the FDA issued a second AI Request on January 17, 2020 to formalize additional questions and remaining requests for information from the earlier July 2019 AI Request. If we cannot successfully address the questions posed by the FDA, our receipt of clearance for this product will be delayed. In addition, the time and expense needed to respond to the FDA\u2019s request for additional information may divert time and attention from our other regulatory submissions in process, which may adversely affect our strategy and ability to commercialize our diagnostic tests and bioinformatics products and services.\nWe expect our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited as a result of an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code triggered by consummation of the transaction with Curetis.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $188.3 million of net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for U.S. federal tax purposes. Under U.S. federal income tax law, we generally can use our NOL carryforwards (and certain tax credits) to offset ordinary taxable income, thereby reducing our U.S. federal income tax liability, for up to 20 years from the year in which the losses were generated, after which time they will expire. State NOL carryforwards (and certain tax credits) generally may be used to offset future state taxable income for 20 years from the year in which the losses are generated, depending on the state, after which time they will expire. The rate at which we can utilize our NOL carryforwards is limited (which could result in NOL carryforwards expiring prior to their use) each time we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. A Section 382 ownership change generally occurs if a shareholder or a group of shareholders who are deemed to own at least 5% of our common stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 generally would impose an annual limit on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income that may be offset with pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (reduced by certain items specified in Section 382) and the U.S. federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect at the time of the ownership change. A number of special and complex rules apply in calculating this Section 382 limitation. While the complexity of Section 382 makes it difficult to determine whether and when an ownership change has occurred, and if a portion of our NOLs is subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, we believe that an additional ownership change may occur upon the consummation of the transaction with Curetis. In addition, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards will be limited to the extent we fail to generate enough taxable income in the future before they expire. Existing and future Section 382 limitations and our inability to generate enough taxable income in the future could result in a substantial portion of our NOL carryforwards expiring before they are used. In addition, under the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, effective for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the deduction for NOLs is limited to 80% of taxable income, NOLs can no longer be carried back, and NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely.\nCurrent OpGen stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the business combination and will exercise less influence over management.\nCurrent OpGen stockholders have the right to vote in the election of the OpGen board of directors and on other matters affecting OpGen. Immediately after the business combination with Curetis is completed, we estimate that then current OpGen stockholders will own approximately 82%, and Curetis N.V. will own approximately 18% of the outstanding shares of OpGen. As a result of the business combination, current OpGen stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of OpGen post-closing than they currently have.\nOur products and services may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nOur products and services may never gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and, therefore, may never generate substantial revenue or profits for us. Our ability to achieve commercial market acceptance for our products will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to convince the medical community of the clinical utility of our products and services and their potential advantages over existing tests, including our surveillance services offering, despite the lack of reimbursement for such services;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop automated rapid pathogen identification and antibiotic resistance testing products and services, including bioinformatics, and convince hospitals and other healthcare providers of the patient safety, improved patient outcomes and potential cost savings that could result;\n\u2022\nour ability to grow our microbial isolate and antibiotic resistance genes knowledgebase;\n\u2022\nour ability to convince the medical community of the accuracy and speed of our products and services, as contrasted with the current methods available; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of hospitals and physicians to use our products and services.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to expand our customer base.\nThe current customers we are targeting for our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel and Acuitas Lighthouse Software test products and services are hospital systems, acute care hospitals, particularly those with advanced care units, such as intensive care units, community-based hospitals and governmental units, such as public health facilities. We need to provide a compelling case for the savings, patient safety and recovery, reduced length of stay and reduced costs that come from adopting our MDRO diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship products and services. If we are not able to successfully increase our customer base, sales of our products and our margins may not meet expectations. Attracting new customers and introducing new products and services requires substantial time and expense. Any failure to expand our existing customer base, or launch new products and services, would adversely affect our ability to improve our operating results.\nIn addition, if our business combination transaction with Curetis does not close, we will likely need to re-assess our strategy and targeting of customers in international markets. We have and, in the event the transaction with Curetis does not close, expect to continue to incur substantial costs in order to obtain customers in foreign markets. Accordingly, in the event the transaction does not close, we may not be able to continue target such customers in international markets.\nWe have seen declining revenues from our current customers for our QuickFISH products as we work to transition to Acuitas rapid pathogen identification products, continued decline without additional product offerings could materially, adversely affect our business.\nIt is not possible to predict the future of the emerging COVID-19 global pandemic or the development of potential tests or treatments. No assurance can be given that OpGen\u2019s or, following the closing of the proposed business combination, Curetis\u2019 products will aid in the testing or the treatment of this virus.\nCuretis, the other party to the proposed business combination with OpGen, has commenced offering products for the testing for SARS-CoV-2, the causal pathogen of COVID-19. OpGen and Curetis may offer other products for testing or treatment of coronavirus. There can be no assurance that the Curetis test or any such future tests will be broadly adopted for use. OpGen and Curetis are among many companies that are trying to develop tests for coronavirus, most of whom have far greater resources than us. If one of these companies develops an effective test, our development of such tests may not significantly increase our revenues and results of operations.\nThe coronavirus pandemic could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has impacted the global economy and may impact our operations here in the United States, including the potential interruption of our clinical trial activities and our supply chain, and may impact Curetis\u2019 operations. As a result of the outbreak, we and certain of our suppliers may be affected and could experience closures and labor shortages, which could disrupt activities. We could therefore face difficulty sourcing key components necessary to produce our product candidates, which may negatively affect our clinical development activities. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for some of these components, they may cost more, which could affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, the coronavirus outbreak could delay enrollment in our clinical trials due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the outbreak, and some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. In addition, healthcare providers are focused almost exclusively on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, and may be unable to continue to participate in our activities.\nAt this point in time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential effect of the novel coronavirus on our business. As coronavirus becomes more widespread each day manufacturing closures and travel restrictions may remain or worsen, all of which would have a negative impact on our ability to operate our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are developing diagnostic products for the more rapid identification of MDROs and antibiotic resistance genomic information. If we are unable to successfully develop, receive regulatory clearance or approval for or commercialize such products and services, our business will be materially, adversely affected.\nWe are developing an under three hour antibiotic resistance diagnostic product that we believe could help address many of the current issues with the need for more rapid identification of infectious diseases and testing for antibiotic resistance. Development of such diagnostic products is difficult and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in such product development efforts, or, if successful, that we will receive the necessary regulatory clearances to commercialize such products. We have identified approximately 47 antibiotic resistance genes to help guide clinician antibiotic therapy decisions when test results are evaluated using the Acuitas Lighthouse Software. Although we have demonstrated preliminary feasibility, and confirmed genotype/phenotype predictive algorithms, such product development efforts will require us to work collaboratively with other companies, academic and government laboratories, and healthcare providers to access sufficient numbers of microbial isolates, develop the diagnostic tests, successfully conduct the necessary clinical trials and apply for and receive regulatory clearances or approvals for the intended use of such\ndiagnostic tests. In addition, we would need to successfully commercialize such products. Such product development, clearance or approval and commercialization activities are time-consuming, expensive and we are not assured that we will have sufficient funds to successfully complete such efforts. Any significant delays or failures in this process could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe offer these products in development to the research use only market and for other non-clinical research uses prior to receiving clearance or approval to commercialize these products in development for use in the clinical setting. We need to comply with the applicable laws and regulations regarding such other uses. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may have a significant impact on the Company.\nWe may enter into agreements with U.S. or other government agencies, which could be subject to uncertain future funding.\nThe presence of MDROs and the need for antibiotic stewardship activities have prompted state, federal and international government agencies to develop programs to combat the effects of MDROs. In 2019, we will be party to a collaboration, called the New York State Infectious Disease Digital Health Initiative, with the New York State DOH and IL\u00daM to develop a research program to detect, track, and manage antimicrobial-resistant infections at healthcare institutions in New York State.\nIn the future, we may seek to enter into additional agreements with governmental funding sources or contract with government healthcare organizations to sell our products and services. Under such agreements, we would rely on the continued performance by these government agencies of their responsibilities under these agreements, including adequate continued funding of the agencies and their programs. We have no control over the resources and funding that government agencies may devote to these agreements, which may be subject to annual renewal.\nGovernment agencies may fail to perform their responsibilities under these agreements, which may cause them to be terminated by the government agencies. In addition, we may fail to perform our responsibilities under these agreements. Any government agreements would be subject to audits, which may occur several years after the period to which the audit relates. If an audit identified significant unallowable costs, we could incur a material charge to our earnings or reduction in our cash position. As a result, we may be unsuccessful entering, or ineligible to enter, into future government agreements.\nIf the utility of our current products and products in development is not supported by studies published in peer-reviewed medical publications, the rate of adoption of our current and future products and services by clinicians and healthcare facilities may be negatively affected.\nThe results of our clinical and economic validation studies involving our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests and Acuitas Lighthouse Software have been presented at major infectious disease and infection control society meetings. We need to maintain and grow a continued presence in peer-reviewed publications to promote clinician adoption of our products. We believe that peer-reviewed journal articles that provide evidence of the utility of our current and future products and services, and adoption by key opinion leaders in the infectious disease market are very important to our commercial success. Clinicians typically take a significant amount of time to adopt new products and testing practices, partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of a favorable cost/benefit analysis. It is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians and administrators about our products and demonstrate their clinical benefits. Clinicians may not adopt our current and future products and services unless they determine, based on published peer- reviewed journal articles and the experience of other clinicians, that our products provide accurate, reliable, useful and cost-effective information that is useful in MDRO diagnosis, screening and outbreak prevention. If our current and future products and services or the technology underlying our products and services or our future product offerings do not receive sufficient favorable exposure in peer-reviewed publications, the rate of clinician adoption could be negatively affected. The publication of clinical data in peer-reviewed journals is a crucial step in commercializing our products, and our inability to control when, if ever, results are published may delay or limit our ability to derive sufficient revenue from any product that is the subject of a study.\nOur sales cycle for our marketed products and services is lengthy and variable, which makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and other operating results.\nWe believe the sales cycles for our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel and Acuitas Lighthouse Software as diagnostic products will be lengthy, which will make it difficult for us to accurately forecast revenues in a given period, and may cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. Potential customers for our products typically need to commit significant time and resources to evaluate our products, and their decision to purchase our products may be further limited by budgetary constraints and numerous layers of internal review and approval, which are beyond our control. We spend substantial time and effort assisting potential customers in evaluating our products. Even after initial approval by appropriate decision makers, the negotiation and documentation processes for the actual adoption of our products on a facility-wide basis can be lengthy. As a result of these factors, based on our experience to date, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a prospective customer to routine commercial use of our\nproducts, has varied and could be 12 months or longer, which has made it difficult for us to accurately project revenues and operating results. In addition, the revenue generated from sales of our products may fluctuate from time to time due to changes in the testing volumes of our customers. As a result, our results may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe are currently party to, and may enter into additional collaborations with third parties to, develop product and services candidates. If these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are currently party to a few collaborations, and anticipate that we will enter into additional collaborations related to our MDRO and informatics products and services. Such collaborations are and may be with pharmaceutical companies, platform companies or other participants in our industry. We have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that any such collaborators could dedicate to the development or commercialization of the subject matter of any such collaboration. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements would depend on our and our collaborator\u2019s abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to each of us in these arrangements. Our relationships with collaborators may pose several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\nwe may not achieve any milestones, or receive any milestone payments, under our collaborations, including milestones and/or payments that we expect to achieve or receive;\n\u2022\nthe clinical trials, if any, conducted as part of these collaborations may not be successful;\n\u2022\na collaborator might elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding or external factors, such as an acquisition, that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\nwe may not have access to, or may be restricted from disclosing, certain information regarding product or services candidates being developed or commercialized under a collaboration and, consequently, may have limited ability to inform our stockholders about the status of such product or services candidates;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\nproduct or services candidates developed in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product or services, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product or services candidates;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product or services candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product candidate;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development of any product or services candidates, may cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of such product or services candidates, may lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to such product or services candidates or may result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise with respect to the ownership of intellectual property developed pursuant to a collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product or services candidates.\nIf our collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or services, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaborations. If we do not receive the funding we would expect under these agreements, our development of product and services candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our product candidates.\nWe may not be successful in finding strategic collaborators for continuing development of certain of our product or services candidates or successfully commercializing or competing in the market for certain indications.\nWe may seek to develop strategic partnerships for developing certain of our product or services candidates, due to capital costs required to develop the product or services candidates or manufacturing constraints. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product or services candidates because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product or services candidates may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort or third parties may not view our product or services candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate commercial success.\nIf we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product or service candidate, reduce or delay our development program, delay our potential commercialization, reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are an early commercial stage company and may never be profitable.\nWe rely principally on the commercialization of our PNAFISH, QuickFISH, and Acuitas Gene Panel test products and our Acuitas Lighthouse Software to generate future revenue growth. To date, our Acuitas test products and Acuitas Lighthouse services have delivered only minimal revenue. We believe that our commercialization success is dependent upon our ability to significantly increase the number of hospitals, long-term care facilities and other inpatient healthcare settings that use our products. If demand for products does not increase as quickly as we have planned, we may be unable to increase our revenue levels as expected. We are currently not profitable. Even if we succeed in increasing adoption of our products by our target markets, maintaining and creating relationships with our existing and new customers and developing and commercializing additional molecular testing products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe sell our products through our own direct sales force, which sells our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (RUO) tests and Acuitas Lighthouse Software and our PNA FISH and QuickFISH products. All of these products and services may be offered and sold to different potential customers or involve discussions with multiple personnel in in-patient facilities. Our future sales will depend in large part on our ability to increase our marketing efforts and adequately address our customers\u2019 needs. The inpatient healthcare industry is a large and diverse market. We will need to attract and develop sales and marketing personnel with industry expertise. Competition for such employees is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain sufficient personnel to maintain an effective sales and marketing force. If we are unable to successfully market our products and adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf our sole manufacturing facility becomes inoperable, our Acuitas, QuickFISH and PNA FISH products, and our business will be harmed.\nWe manufacture our Acuitas, QuickFISH and PNA FISH products in our facility in Gaithersburg Maryland. We do not have redundant facilities. Our facility and the equipment we use manufacture our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace, if damaged or destroyed. The facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us manufacture our products for some period of time. The inability to manufacture our products may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers in the future. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn order to establish a redundant facility, we would have to spend considerable time and money securing adequate space, constructing the facility, recruiting and training employees, and establishing the additional operational and administrative infrastructure necessary to support a second facility. Additionally, any new manufacturing facility opened by us would be subject to FDA inspection and certification. If we fail to maintain our FDA certification or if our FDA certification is suspended, limited or revoked, we would not be able manufacture our products.\nIf demand for these products increase beyond our current forecasts or, regulatory requirements arise, we may not be able to meet our obligations to manufacture these products, and backlog or reduced demand for such products could occur. If any of these issues occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of our materials and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers.\nWe rely on several sole suppliers and manufacturers, including Thermo Fisher Scientific and QIAGEN, for supplying certain reagents, raw materials, supplies and substances which we use to manufacture our products. An interruption in our operations could occur if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these items or manufacturing our products, and if we cannot, then obtain an acceptable substitute. Any such interruption or damage to third party suppliers or manufacturers for any reason, such as fire or other events beyond our control, including as a result of natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the novel coronavirus, could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIf we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve and sustain profitability.\nOur competitors include rapid diagnostic testing and traditional microbiology companies, commercial laboratories, information technology companies, and hospital laboratories who may internally develop testing capabilities. Principal competitive factors in our target market include: organizational size, scale, and breadth of product offerings; rapidity of test results; quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data and confidence in diagnostic results; cost effectiveness; ease of use; and regulatory approval status.\nOur principal competition comes from traditional methods used by healthcare providers to diagnose and screen for MDROs and from other molecular diagnostic companies creating screening and diagnostic products such as Cepheid, Becton-Dickinson, bioM\u00e9rieux, Accelerate Diagnostics, T2 Biosystems, GenMark, and Nanosphere.\nWe also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Pathnostics, and EuroFins, which have strong infrastructure to support the commercialization of diagnostic laboratory services.\nCompetitors may develop their own versions of competing products in countries where we do not have patents or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized.\nMany of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, research and development and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by hospitals, physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our product and service offering, or offer products at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the list prices of our product and service offerings and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur products and services are not covered by reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental and third-party payors. If we cannot convince our customers that the savings from use of our products and services will increase their overall reimbursement, our business could suffer.\nOur products and services do not currently receive reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, other governmental payors or commercial third-party payors. Policy and rule changes in reimbursement announced by CMS, including potential financial incentives for reductions in hospital acquired infection, and penalties and decreased Medicare reimbursement for patients with HAIs provide us with an opportunity to establish a business case for the purchase and use of our screening and diagnostic products and services. If we cannot convince our customers that the savings from use of our products and services will increase or stabilize their overall profitability and improve clinical outcomes, our business will suffer.\nFailure in our information technology, storage systems or our Acuitas Lighthouse Software could significantly disrupt our operations and our research and development efforts, which could adversely impact our revenues, as well as our research, development and commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems, which support our operations and our research and development efforts, as well as our storage systems and our analyzers. Due to the sophisticated nature of the technology we use in our products and service offerings, including our Acuitas\nLighthouse Software services, we are substantially dependent on our information technology systems. Information technology systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information technology systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data, and in particular to operate our Acuitas Lighthouse Software, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Any interruption in the operation of our Acuitas Lighthouse Software, due to information technology system failures, part failures or potential disruptions in the event we are required to relocate our instruments within our facility or to another facility, could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information and personally identifiable information about our customers and their patients. We also store sensitive intellectual property and other proprietary business information, including that of our customers. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site systems and cloud-based data center systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business critical information, including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nWe face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information: loss of access risk, inappropriate disclosure risk, inappropriate modification risk and the risk of our being unable to identify and audit our controls over the first three risks.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store this critical information. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure or modification of confidential information. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.\nA security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to consumer information (including personally identifiable information or protected health information) could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with disparate state breach notification laws, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. If we are unable to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above.\nAny such breach or interruption could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be inaccessible or could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such interruption in access, improper access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the federal HIPAA and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to perform tests, provide test results, bill facilities or patients, process claims and appeals, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare Company financial information, provide information about our current and future solutions and other patient and clinician education and outreach efforts through our website, and manage the administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Any such breach could also result in the compromise of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nData collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the use, processing, and cross-border transfer of personal information.\nThe collection, use, storage, transfer, and other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals in the European Economic Area is governed, as of May 2018, by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR imposes several requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to the processing of health and other sensitive data, the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals regarding data processing activities, the notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and certain measures to be taken when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area, including to the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules, including as implemented by individual countries. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any future European activities.\nCalifornia recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.\nWe cannot provide assurance that future legislation will not prevent us from generating or maintaining personal data or that patients will consent to the use of their personal information, either of which may prevent us from undertaking or publishing essential research. These burdens or risks may prove too great for us to reasonably bear and may adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability or maintain profitably in the future.\nIf we are unable to develop products to keep pace with rapid technological, medical and scientific change, our operating results and competitive position could be harmed. New test development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be successful in our efforts to develop and commercialize our diagnostic and screening products and services. The further development and commercialization of additional diagnostic and screening product and service offering are key to our growth strategy.\nA key element of our strategy is to discover, develop, validate and commercialize a portfolio of additional diagnostic and screening products and services to rapidly diagnose and effectively treat MDRO infections and reduce the associated costs to patients, inpatient facilities and the healthcare industry. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete development of or commercialize any of our planned future products and services, or that they will be clinically usable. The product development process involves a high degree of risk and may take up to several years or more. Our new product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of the tests at the research or development stage;\n\u2022\nlack of clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the tests;\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from the failure of third-party suppliers or contractors to meet their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain or maintain necessary certifications, licenses, clearances or approvals to market or perform the test; or\n\u2022\nlack of commercial acceptance by in-patient healthcare facilities.\nFew research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of new products, or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical studies or trials, which would adversely impact the timing for generating potential revenues from those new products. In addition, as we develop new products, we will have to make additional investments in our sales and marketing operations, which may be prematurely or unnecessarily incurred if the commercial launch of a product is abandoned or delayed.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employee benefits liability, property, umbrella, business interruption, workers\u2019 compensation, product liability, errors and omissions and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the use of hazardous materials and the handling of patient samples. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. We are, or may be in the future, subject to compliance with additional laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, and including those relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, requirements. The requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. Failure to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our production processes, cessation of operations or other actions, which could severely harm our business.\nIf we are sued for product liability or errors and omissions liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our products could lead to product liability claims if someone were to allege that a product failed to perform as it was designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the results we provide to physicians or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. For example, if we diagnosed a patient as having an MDRO but such result was a false positive, the patient could be unnecessarily isolated in an in-patient setting or receive inappropriate treatment. We may also be subject to similar types of claims related to products we may develop in the future. A product liability or errors and omissions liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance, we cannot assure you that our insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of any such claims. Any product liability or errors and omissions liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation or cause us to suspend sales of our products and services. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the current economic environment and future adverse economic environments.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, invest in and grow our business and meet our financial obligations depends on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to numerous factors, including the prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control, such as the rate of unemployment, the number of uninsured persons in the United States and inflationary pressures. We cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions, and those in the future, could adversely impact our business.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with reduced profitability and the potential financial instability of our customers, many of which may be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets. For example, unemployment and underemployment, and the resultant loss of insurance, may decrease the demand for healthcare services and diagnostic testing. If fewer patients are seeking medical care because they do not have insurance coverage, we may experience reductions in revenues, profitability and/or cash flow. In addition, if economic challenges in the United States result in widespread and prolonged unemployment, either regionally or on a national basis, a substantial number of people may become uninsured or underinsured. To the extent such economic challenges result in less demand for our proprietary tests, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Public Company Status\nWe incur increased costs and demands on management as a result of compliance with laws and regulations applicable to public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, impose a number of requirements on public companies, including with respect to corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance and disclosure obligations. Moreover, compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and has made some activities more time-consuming and costly. It is also more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nTrading of our common stock is limited, and trading restrictions imposed on us by applicable regulations may further reduce trading in our common stock, making it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares; and future sales of common stock could reduce our stock price.\nTrading of our common stock is currently conducted on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The liquidity of our common stock is limited, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also as it may be adversely affected by delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of us, if at all. In addition, following the August 2019 reverse stock split, without a large public float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate his investment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future, if at all.\nWe must maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market ongoing listing requirements, including the minimum bid price of our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 equity. If we fail to maintain such compliance, our common stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, trading in our common stock will be more limited, and would discourage investors from investing in our securities.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our reported financial information and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated.\nWhen we are no longer an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to issue an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there are material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls or the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, implemented or reviewed.\nWhen we are no longer an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, if our auditors were to express an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting because we had one or more material weaknesses, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial disclosures, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Internal control deficiencies could also result in a restatement of our financial results in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.\nDuring the period from our initial public offering in May 2015 through December 31, 2019, the market price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $2,720.00 per share to a low of $0.92 per share, and our stock price continues to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to grow our revenue and customer base;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning regulatory oversight and approvals;\n\u2022\nvariations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts;\n\u2022\nsuccesses or challenges in our collaborative arrangements or alternative funding sources;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the health care and life science industries;\n\u2022\nthe results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nFurther, the stock market in general, and the market for health care and life science companies in particular, has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The volatility of our common stock is further exacerbated due to its low trading volume. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock and the loss of some or all of your investment.\nThe exercise of outstanding common stock purchase warrants and stock options will have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of our capital stock by existing stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding warrants to acquire 5,111,107 shares of our common stock, and stock options to purchase 9,654 shares of our common stock. The expiration of the term of such options and warrants range from January 2020 to February 2025. A significant number of such warrants are out of the money, but the holders have the right to effect a cashless exercise of such warrants. If a significant number of such warrants and stock options are exercised by the holders, the percentage of our common stock owned by our existing stockholders will be diluted.\nWe issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,255 shares of common stock to jVen Capital and MGHIF in connection with the bridge financing transactions. These warrants must be revalued each reporting period. Such assessments involve the use of estimates that could later be found to differ materially from actual results, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn June and July 2017, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate 1,255 shares of common stock to jVen Capital and MGHIF in connection with the bridge financing transactions. Each of these warrants has a put feature that allow the holder to put the warrants back to the Company for cash equal to the Black-Scholes value upon a change of control or fundamental transaction. The warrants are each recorded as a liability on our financial statements, and we are required to revalue each of the warrants each financial quarter. Such revaluations necessarily involve the use of estimates, assumptions, probabilities and application of complex accounting principles. Actual value at the time the warrants are exercised could vary significantly from the value assigned to such liabilities on a quarterly basis. We cannot assure you that the revaluation of the warrants will equal the value in the future and know that the actual value could be significantly different, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, as these warrants will be valued based upon the Black-Scholes value, which assesses a value to the warrants even if the exercise price is below the current fair market value of the underlying security, warrant holders could get a disproportionate amount of the consideration upon a change of control or fundamental transaction under certain circumstances.\nWe are an emerging growth company and have elected to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined under the Securities Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until December 2020. As an emerging growth company, we take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to certain other public companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial statement and financial-related disclosures, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtaining stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved by our stockholders. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure we may make, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Business\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests and Acuitas Lighthouse, and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe have submitted one 510(k) submission with the FDA for our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Isolates) test and have plans to make additional De Novo and 510(k) submissions for our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel test and for our Acuitas Lighthouse Software. Such process is complex, time consuming and expensive. For any filed 510(k) or De Novo submissions, the FDA may not clear or approve these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Failure to receive, or a significant delay in receiving, a required clearance or approval for our products would have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses.\nWe are currently offering for sale our FDA-cleared QuickFISH and PNA FISH products, and our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) test as an RUO test to CROs, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. We believe that our promotional activities for these products falls within the scope of the FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion and applicable premarket exemptions. However, the FDA could disagree and require us to stop promoting our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (Urine) test as an RUO test, or our FDA-cleared products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses unless and until we obtain FDA clearance or approval for those uses. We could be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions for any violations, including, but not limited to, the issuance of an untitled letter, a Form 483 letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products would be impaired.\nA number of the rapid diagnostic products are regulated by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA, or other foreign regulatory authority, requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with the products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nWe do not have significant experience in complying with the rules and regulations of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The rapid diagnostic products regulated as medical devices, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such products, are subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with FDA\u2019s QSR regulations for the manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of the QuickFISH and PNA FISH products and other regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval, and with ISO regulations. The FDA enforces the QSR and similarly, other regulatory bodies with similar regulations enforce those regulations through periodic inspections. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions against us: (1) untitled letters, Form 483 observation letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; (2) unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; (3) customer notifications for repair, replacement and refunds; (4) recall, detention or seizure of our products; (5) operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; (6) refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products; (7) operating restrictions; (8) withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; (9) refusal to grant export approval for our products; or (10) criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it could harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, if any of our key component suppliers are not in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, we may be unable to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nWe and our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements, including primarily the QSR and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form 483, untitled letters, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. Since 2009, the FDA has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our FDA-cleared products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could take a number of regulatory actions, including but not limited to, preventing us from manufacturing any or all of our devices or performing laboratory testing on human specimens, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nSome of the clearances obtained are subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed, which can reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we were to lose, or have restrictions imposed on, FDA clearances received to date, or clearances we may receive in the future, our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations would likely be significantly adversely affected.\nModifications to our marketed products may require new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nIf we modify any of our FDA-cleared products, such modifications would require additional clearances or approvals. Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review the manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or file a PMA for any modification to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing and distributing, or to recall the modified product until we obtain such clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Further, our products could be subject to recall if the FDA determines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective. Any recall or FDA requirement that we seek additional approvals or clearances could result in significant delays, fines, increased costs associated with modification of a product, loss of revenue and potential operating restrictions imposed by the FDA.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of regulated products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture.\nManufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications\nof recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA and international medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the applicable regulatory authority information that a device has, or may have, caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report these events within the required timeframes, or at all, the regulatory authorities could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe may generate a larger portion of our future revenue internationally and would then be subject to increased risks relating to international activities which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe believe that a portion of our future revenue growth will come from international sources as we implement and expand overseas operations, including South America and Europe. Engaging in international business involves a number of difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with existing and changing foreign health care and other regulatory requirements and laws, such as those relating to patient privacy;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and U.K. Bribery Act, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti- competition regulations;\n\u2022\nexport or import restrictions;\n\u2022\nvarious reimbursement and insurance regimes;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights.\nAs we expand internationally, our results of operations and cash flows would become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is in the United States. If the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies in the future, in the absence of a corresponding change in local currency prices, our future revenue could be adversely affected as we convert future revenue from local currencies to U.S. dollars. If we dedicate resources to our international operations and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, operating results and prospects will suffer.\nWe face the risk of potential liability under the FCPA for past international distributions of products and to the extent we distribute products or otherwise operate internationally in the future.\nIn the past, we have distributed certain of our products internationally, and in the future, we may distribute our products internationally and possibly engage in additional international operations. The FCPA prohibits companies such as us from engaging, directly or indirectly, in making payments to foreign government and political officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage, including, among other things, the distribution of products and other international business operations. Like other U.S. companies operating abroad, we may face liability under the FCPA if we, or third parties we have used to distribute our products or otherwise advance our international business, have violated the FCPA. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We could also suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures.\nRisks Related to Compliance with Healthcare and Regulations\nChanges in healthcare policy, including legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nIn March 2010, both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, with the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, were enacted. The constitutionality of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation was confirmed twice by the Supreme Court of the United States. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation has changed the existing state of the health care system by expanding coverage through voluntary state Medicaid expansion, attracting previously uninsured persons through the health care insurance exchanges and by modifying the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices. The U.S. Congress is seeking to replace the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. At this time the Company is not certain as to the impact of federal health care legislation on its business.\nThe 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation includes the Open Payments Act (formerly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act), which, in conjunction with its implementing regulations, requires manufacturers of certain drugs, biologics, and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually certain payments or \u201ctransfers of value\u201d provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Recent amendments to the Open Payments Act expand the categories of health care providers for which reporting is required. The failure to report appropriate data accurately, timely, and completely could subject us to significant financial penalties. Other countries and several states currently have similar laws and more may enact similar legislation.\nWe cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or in countries outside of the United States in which we may do business, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. Any changes in government regulation of the United States healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to potential enforcement actions involving false claims, kickbacks, physician self-referral or other federal or state fraud and abuse laws, and we could incur significant civil and criminal sanctions, which would hurt our business.\nThe government has made enforcement of the false claims, anti-kickback, physician self-referral and various other fraud and abuse laws a major priority. In many instances, private whistleblowers also are authorized to enforce these laws even if government authorities choose not to do so. In most of these cases, private whistleblowers brought the allegations to the attention of federal enforcement agencies. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that some of the laws and regulations have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. We could be subject to enforcement actions under the following laws:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which constrains certain marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nfederal physician self-referral laws, such as the Stark Law, which prohibit a physician from making a referral to a provider of certain health services with which the physician or the physician\u2019s family member has a financial interest, and prohibit submission of a claim for reimbursement pursuant to a prohibited referral; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf we or our operations, are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. We will monitor changes in government enforcement as we grow and expand our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and hurt our reputation. If we were excluded from participation in U.S. federal healthcare programs, we would not be able to receive, or to sell our tests to other parties who receive reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we cannot license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize new products in the future.\nIn the future, we may license third-party technology to develop or commercialize new products. In return for the use of a third party\u2019s technology, we may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of our solutions. Royalties are a component of cost of services and affect the margins on our products. We may also need to negotiate licenses to patents and patent applications after introducing a commercial product. Our business may suffer if we are unable to enter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license or fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property.\nIn July 2015, we issued a senior secured promissory note, in the principal amount of $1 million to MGHIF. Such promissory note is secured by a lien on our assets, including our intellectual property assets. If we default on our payment obligations under this secured promissory note, MGHIF has the right to control the disposition of our assets, including our intellectual property assets. If such default occurs, and our intellectual property assets are sold or licensed, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe apply for patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, as we deem appropriate, however we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions. It is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and even if patents are granted, they may not provide a basis for intellectual property protection of commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties. It is possible that others will design around our current or future patented technologies. We may not be successful in defending any challenges made against our patents or patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents and increased competition to our business. The outcome of patent litigation can be uncertain and any attempt by us to enforce our patent rights against others may not be successful, or, if successful, may take substantial time and result in substantial cost, and may divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nThe patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies\u2019 patents has emerged to date in the United States or elsewhere. Courts frequently render opinions in the biotechnology field that may affect the patentability of certain inventions or discoveries, including opinions that may affect the patentability of methods for analyzing or comparing DNA.\nIn particular, the patent positions of companies engaged in the development and commercialization of genomic diagnostic tests, like ours, are particularly uncertain. Various courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have recently rendered decisions that affect the scope of patentability of certain inventions or discoveries relating to certain diagnostic tests and related methods. These decisions state, among other things, that patent claims that recite laws of nature (for example, the relationship between blood levels of certain metabolites and the likelihood that a dosage of a specific drug will be ineffective or cause harm) are not themselves patentable. What constitutes a law of nature is uncertain, and it is possible that certain aspects of genetic diagnostics tests would be considered natural laws. Accordingly, the evolving case law in the United States may adversely affect our ability to obtain patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to any owned and licensed patents. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter difficulties protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of many other countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. We may not develop additional proprietary products, methods and technologies that are patentable.\nIn addition to pursuing patents on our technology, we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into agreements, including confidentiality agreements, non-disclosure agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements, with our employees, consultants, academic institutions, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. If we are required to assert our rights against such party, it could result in significant cost and distraction.\nMonitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets.\nWe may also be subject to claims that our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of third parties, or to claims that we have improperly used or obtained such trade secrets. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights and face increased competition to our business. A loss of key research personnel work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize potential products, which could harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nFurther, competitors could attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or replicate any of our products and technologies. If our intellectual property does not adequately protect us against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nWe have not yet registered certain of our trademarks in all of our potential markets. If we apply to register these trademarks, our applications may not be allowed for registration in a timely fashion or at all, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. In addition, opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademark applications and registrations, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would.\nTo the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.\nWe may be involved in litigation related to intellectual property, which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may receive notices of claims of direct or indirect infringement or misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights from time to time. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in such actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or other rights, or the validity of our patents, trademarks or other rights, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.\nWe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. To determine the priority of these inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, or other post-grant proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office that could result in substantial cost to us. No assurance can be given that other patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications. In addition, recent changes to the patent laws of the United States allow for various post-grant opposition proceedings that have not been extensively tested, and their outcome is therefore uncertain. Furthermore, if third parties bring these proceedings against our patents, we could experience significant costs and management distraction.\nLitigation may be necessary for us to enforce our patent and proprietary rights or to determine the scope, coverage and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of any litigation or other proceeding is inherently uncertain and might not be favorable to us, and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require on acceptable terms or at all. Further, we could encounter delays in product introductions, or interruptions in product sales, as we develop alternative methods or products. In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity, scope and coverage of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAs we move into new markets and applications for our products, incumbent participants in such markets may assert their patents and other proprietary rights against us as a means of slowing our entry into such markets or as a means to extract substantial license and royalty payments from us. Our competitors and others may now and, in the future, have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we currently have. In addition, future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence or protection. Therefore, our commercial success may depend in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous significant intellectual property issues have been litigated, and will likely continue to be litigated, between existing and new participants in our existing and targeted markets and competitors may assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into or growth in those markets. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, our competitors and others may have patents or may in the future obtain patents and claim that making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending against any of these claims. Parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which could block our ability to develop, commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and ongoing royalties, and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. We could incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products to avoid infringing third-party patents or proprietary rights. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our business and our ability to gain market acceptance for our products.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our agreements with some of our customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we do business require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims, including the types of claims described above. We could also voluntarily agree to defend or indemnify third parties in instances where we are not obligated to do so if we determine it would be important to our business relationships. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses that could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15381, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "OPGN"}
