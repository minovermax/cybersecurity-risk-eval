{"cik": "914139", "company": "PARKERVISION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\ufeff\nOur independent registered certified public accounting firm has included in their audit opinion on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 a statement with respect to substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. The substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with our suppliers and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\n\ufeff\nWe have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operation.\n\ufeff\nWe have had losses in each year since our inception in 1989, and continue to have an accumulated deficit which, at December 31, 2016, was approximately $352 million. The net loss for 2016 was approximately $21.5 million. To date, our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating, research and development and overhead costs. We will continue to make expenditures on patent protection and enforcement, research and development, marketing, and general operations in order to secure and fulfill any contracts that we achieve for the sale of our products or technologies. Our revenues in 2017 may not bring the Company to profitability and our current capital resources may not be sufficient to sustain our operations through 2017. If we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or obtain sufficient capital resources, we will not be able to implement our business plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment. This may also result in a change in our business strategies.\n\ufeff\nWe expect to need additional capital in the future. Failure to raise such additional capital may prevent us from implementing our business plan as currently formulated.\n\ufeff\nBecause we have had net losses and, to date, have not generated positive cash flow from operations, we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time. We anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for research and development, marketing, and general operations. Furthermore, we expect that the implementation of significant cost reduction measures in order to reduce our cash needs may jeopardize our operations and future growth plans. Our current capital resources include cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $0.3 million at December 31, 2016 and $9.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities in the first three months of 2017. Without the generation of sufficient revenues, our current capital resources may not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for 2017 and we may require additional capital to fund our operations. Financing, if any, may be in the form of additional sales of equity securities, including common or preferred stock. The sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations, any of which may be burdensome to us. The sale of equity securities, including common or preferred stock, may result in dilution to the current shareholders\u2019 ownership and may be limited by the number of shares we have authorized and available for issuance. The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues, additional funding, reducing expenses, or a combination of the foregoing. The failure to generate sufficient revenues, raise additional capital or reduce expenses will have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve our long-term business objectives.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur litigation funding arrangements may impair our ability obtain future financing and/or generate sufficient cash flows to support our future operations.\n\ufeff\nWe have funded much of our cost of litigation through contingent financing arrangements with a third-party funder and contingent fee arrangements with legal counsel. The repayment obligation to the third-party funder is secured by our assets until such time that we have repaid a specified minimum return. Furthermore, our contingent financing arrangements will result in reductions in the amount of net proceeds retained by us from litigation, licensing and other patent-related activities. For example, the third-party litigation funder is entitled to priority payment of at least the next $9.7 million in patent-related proceeds received by us. Thereafter, any remaining net proceeds will be prorated between us, our legal counsel and the third-party funder. The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from patent related actions or the sale of our products or technologies, additional funding, reducing expenses or a combination of the foregoing. The failure to generate sufficient revenues to repay our contingent obligations may impede our ability to obtain additional financing which will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long-term business objectives.\n\ufeff\nIf our patents and intellectual property rights do not provide us with the anticipated market protections, our competitive position, business, and prospects will be impaired.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on our intellectual property rights, including patents and patent applications, to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property. We believe that our patents are for entirely new technologies and that our patents are valid, enforceable and valuable. However, third parties have made claims of invalidity with respect to certain of our patents and other similar claims may be brought in the future. For example in the course of our litigation with Qualcomm, the courts have ruled that a number of our patent claims that were subject of our litigation were invalid. If our patents are shown not to be as broad as currently believed, or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost, we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies. As a result, there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects. Furthermore, defending against challenges to our patents may give rise to material costs for defense and divert resources away from our other activities.\n\ufeff\nOur litigation can be time-consuming, costly and we cannot anticipate the results.\n\ufeff\nSince 2011, we have spent a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue patent infringement litigation against third parties. We believe this litigation, and others that we may in the future determine to pursue, could continue to consume management and financial resources for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that our current or future litigation matters will ultimately result in a favorable outcome for us. In addition, even if we obtain favorable interim rulings or verdicts in particular litigation matters, they may not be predictive of the ultimate resolution of the matter. For example, we received a favorable jury decision in our litigation against Qualcomm, but that jury decision was overturned by the district court and the appellate court supported the district court decision. Unfavorable outcomes could result in exhaustion of our financial resources and could otherwise hinder our ability to pursue licensing and/or product opportunities for our technologies which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business prospects. We have contingent fee arrangements in place with others to reduce our litigation-related expenditures; however any litigation-based, or other patent related amounts collected by us will be subject to contingency payments to our legal counsel and other funding parties which will reduce the amount retained by us.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are subject to outside influences beyond our control, including new legislation that could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement activities and have an adverse impact on the execution of our business plan.\n\ufeff\nOur licensing and enforcement activities are subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including new legislation, regulations and rules related to obtaining or enforcing patents. For instance, the U.S. has enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system including changes that transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system and that alter the processes for challenging issued patents. To the extent that we are unable to secure patent protection for our future technologies and/or our current patents are challenged such that some or all of our protection is lost, we will suffer adverse effects to our ability to offer unique products and technologies. As a result, there would be an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to execute our business plan.\n\ufeff\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass, will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity.\n\ufeff\nBecause of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the wireless technology industry, we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings. For example, in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we spent approximately $3.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, on research and development and, we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future. These efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish market share and, ultimately, to generate revenues. If another company offers better products or technologies, a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost, and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nIf our technologies and/or products are not commercially accepted, our developmental investment will be lost and our ability to do business will be impaired.\n\ufeff\nThere can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products, or that our technologies and products will be established in the market as improvements over current competitive offerings. If our existing or new technologies and products are not commercially accepted, the funds expended will not be recoverable, and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected. In addition, perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees.\n\ufeff\nWe rely, in large part, on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our products, which if not developed or maintained, will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and will result in a loss of business opportunity.\n\ufeff\nTo achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our products and technologies, as part of our business strategy, we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate our technologies into their products and/or market products based on our technologies. The successful commercialization of our products and technologies will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts with respect to the products and related development requirements. The failure to develop or maintain these business relationships will limit the commercialization of our products and technologies which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are highly dependent on Mr. Jeffrey Parker as our chief executive officer. If his services were lost, it would have an adverse impact on the execution of our business plan.\n\ufeff\nBecause of Mr. Parker\u2019s leadership position in the company and the respect he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community, the loss of his services might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan. If Mr. Parker was no longer available to the company, investors might experience an adverse impact on their investment. We currently have an employment agreement and maintain key-employee life insurance for our benefit for Mr. Parker.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to attract or retain key executives and other highly skilled employees, we will not be able to execute our current business plans.\n\ufeff\nOur business is very specialized, and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized key executives and other employees to conduct our research, development and customer support activities. The inability to obtain or retain these key executives and other specialized employees would have an adverse impact on the research, development and technical customer support activities that our products require. These activities are instrumental to the successful execution of our business plan.\n\ufeff\nOur outstanding options, warrants, and restricted share units may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2016, we had 13,183,036 shares of common stock outstanding and had 1,446,696 options, warrants, and restricted share units outstanding for the purchase and/or issuance of additional shares of common stock. Of these outstanding equity instruments, 989,196 were exercisable as of December 31, 2016. All of the shares of common stock underlying these securities is registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder. The amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market. In addition, the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current shareholders\u2019 ownership.\n\ufeff\nThe price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility.\n\ufeff\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016 (after giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse stock split), the reported high and low sales prices for our common stock ranged between $1.50 and $11.20 per share. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, developments in outstanding litigations, our performance and prospects, general conditions of the markets in which we compete, and economic and financial conditions. Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.\n\ufeff\nThere can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market or another national securities exchange.\nAs of January 19, 2017, we have failed to meet the market value standard of the continued listing standards for Nasdaq Capital Market companies. We have been afforded until July 18, 2017 to regain compliance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the market value or any of the other Nasdaq Capital Market listing standards. If we are unable to regain compliance with the standards within the time frame set by Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted. Additionally, from April 21, 2015 to April 15, 2016, we were not in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market minimum bid price\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequirement of $1. While we were able to regain compliance with the bid price requirement, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue maintain such compliance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing standards. If we are unable to do so, our common stock may no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or another national securities exchange and the liquidity and market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.\n\ufeff\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and intend to retain our cash and future earnings, if any, to fund our business plan. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements. We therefore cannot offer any assurance that our board of directors will determine to pay special or regular dividends in the future. Accordingly, unless our board of directors determines to pay dividends, stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. There can be no assurance that this appreciation will occur.\n\ufeff\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of shareholders.\n\ufeff\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes with directors having staggered terms of office, our board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval, and there are advance notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from shareholders to a vote by all the shareholders under the by-laws. Florida law also has anti-takeover provisions in its corporate statute.\n\ufeff\nWe have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management, which may conflict with the interests of some of the shareholders.\n\ufeff\nOn November 17, 2005, as amended on November 20, 2015, our board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance, on November 29, 2005, as a dividend, of rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock. The rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them. In the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid. Additionally, the rights have what are known as \u201cflip-in\u201d and \u201cflip-over\u201d provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly. The principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with the board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid. This plan may limit, prevent, or discourage a takeover offer that some shareholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction. A negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the shareholders.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 80019, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "PRKR"}
