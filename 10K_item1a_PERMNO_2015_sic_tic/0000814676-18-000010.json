Risk Factors.\nWe are heavily dependent on the electronics industry and changes in the industry could harm our business and operating results.\nThe electronics industry is subject to economic cycles, demand in some segments is currently volatile, and is likely in the future to experience recessionary periods. A protracted general recession in the electronics industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate substantially, which may cause our stock price to fall.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations have varied in the past, and our operating results may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors including, but not limited to: timing of orders from major customers; mix of products and services; pricing and other competitive pressures; delays in prototype shipments, economic conditions in the electronics industry, raw material costs, and our ability to time expenditures in anticipation of future revenues.\nSome executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business and these key personnel may not remain with the Company in the future.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of some executive officers and other key personnel. Our employees are not bound by employment agreements, and there can be no assurance that the Company will retain its officers and key employees.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available.\nIf our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements, we will have to raise additional funds. The sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading prices of our common stock has been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, developments in the electronics industry, changes in general economic conditions and economic conditions in the electronics industry, and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market prices of technology companies and which have been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks.\nAs part of our business we face certain security threats including: (1) threats to our technology infrastructure; (2) attempts to gain access to our propriety, sensitive or classified information; (3) threats to physical security, including our facilities and personnel; and (4) threats from terrorism or similar acts. Cybersecurity threats in particular are persistent, evolve quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches. Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. We believe we have implemented appropriate measures and controls to appropriately identify and monitor these threats and mitigate potential risks. However, there can be no assurance that any such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches, disruptions to mission critical systems, the unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data, or harm to facilities or personnel.\nThe impact of these security threats and other disruptions is difficult to predict. They could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public. Any one of these outcomes could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe Company relies on a small number of customers for a large percentage of its revenues.\nHistorically the Company has had a small number of customers representing a large percentage of its total sales. Although the Company endeavors to expand its customer base, we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenues in any given period for the foreseeable future. The reliance makes us particularly susceptible to factors affecting those customers. If such customers\u2019 business declines and as a result our sales to such customers decline without corresponding sales orders from other customers, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe growth of our business depends upon the development and successful commercial acceptance of our new products.\nOur failure to develop, manufacture, and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset a decline in revenue from existing products or to successfully manage product and related inventory transactions could harm our business. We depend upon timely and efficient completion of design and development, implementation of manufacturing processes, and effective sales, marketing and customer service. Because of the complexity of our products, significant delays may occur in introducing new products, or between a product\u2019s initial introduction and volume production.\nTechnological changes may make our products obsolete or result in decreased prices or increased expenses.\nAlthough our products are \u201cdesigned-in\u201d and often have lives lasting several years, any technological changes could eliminate our competitive advantages. This could lead to significant price erosion for products. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and offer more advanced products in the future, to anticipate both future demand and the technology to supply that demand, to enhance our current products and services, to provide those products and services at competitive prices on a timely and cost-effective basis to achieve market acceptance of those products and services.\nExchange rates can impact our business adversely.\nOur major competitor is based in Japan and, as a result, our relative costs vary by the Yen/Dollar exchange rate. As the dollar strengthens versus the Yen, our relative costs increase affecting our margins and prices to major customers.\nTax reform may significantly affect the Company and its Shareholders\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The TCJA among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating loss carryforwards, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \u2018worldwide\u2019 system of taxation to a territorial system. We do not expect tax reform to have a material impact to our projection of minimal cash taxes or to our net operating losses. Our net deferred tax assets have been revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate as of December 30, 2017. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is uncertain and could be adverse. This 10-K does not discuss any such legislation or the manner in which it might affect purchases of our common stock. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 11511, "SIC": 3290, "TIC": "CPSH"}
