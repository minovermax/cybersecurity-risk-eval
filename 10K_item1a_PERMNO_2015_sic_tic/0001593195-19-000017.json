{"cik": "1593195", "company": "Tribune Publishing Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider each of the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. The following risks relate to the Company\u2019s business, the separation from TCO, the securities markets and ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, the Company could be materially and adversely affected. If this occurs, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nAdvertising demand is expected to continue to be affected by changes in economic conditions and fragmentation of the media landscape.\nAdvertising revenue is our largest source of revenue. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. National and local economic conditions, particularly in major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified newspaper advertising revenue. Changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, auto sales, fuel prices, housing sales, unemployment rates, job creation, and circulation levels and rates, as well as federal, state and local election cycles, all affect demand for advertising.\nThe trend towards online shopping has negatively impacted retailers, which constitute a primary advertising channel of the Company. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. Consolidation across various industries, such as large department store and telecommunications companies, may also reduce overall advertising revenue.\nCompetition from other media, including other metropolitan, suburban and national newspapers, websites, including news aggregation websites, social media websites and search engines, broadcasters, cable systems and networks, satellite television and radio, magazines, direct marketing and solo and shared mail programs, affects our ability to retain advertising clients and maintain or raise rates. In recent years, Internet sites devoted to recruitment, automotive and real estate have become significant competitors of our newspapers and websites for classified advertising and have significantly eroded our share of classified advertising revenue.\nSeasonal variations in consumer spending cause our quarterly advertising revenue to fluctuate. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenue is typically higher than first and third quarter advertising revenue, reflecting the slower economic activity in the winter and summer and the stronger fourth quarter holiday season.\nDemand for our products is also one of many factors in determining advertising rates. For example, circulation levels for our newspapers have been declining.\nAll of these factors continue to contribute to a difficult advertising sales environment and may further adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our advertising revenue. Our advertising revenues may decline or may decline at a faster rate than anticipated.\nIncreasing popularity of digital media and the shift in newspaper readership demographics, consumer habits and advertising expenditures from traditional print to digital media have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our operating revenues and may require significant capital investments due to changes in technology.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for delivery of news and other content and have resulted in a wide variety of consumer demands and expectations, which are also rapidly evolving. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nThe increasing number of digital media options available on the Internet, through social networking tools and through mobile and other devices distributing news and other content, is expanding consumer choice significantly. Faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume digital content than they do on the source or reliability of such content.\nFurther, as existing newspaper readers get older, younger generations may not develop similar readership habits. News aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) may reduce our traffic levels by driving interaction away from our websites or our digital applications. If traffic levels stagnate or decline, we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital businesses or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital platforms.\nIn addition, the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. Digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are also playing a significant role in the advertising marketplace, which may cause downward pricing pressure. In addition, evolving standards for delivery of digital advertising, such as viewability, could adversely affect advertising revenues. Consequently, our digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. A decrease in our customers\u2019 advertising expenditures, reduced demand for our offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses and assets. Our inability to maintain and/or improve the performance of our customers\u2019 advertising results on our digital properties may negatively influence rates we achieve in the marketplace for our advertising inventory.\nPaywalls on our newspaper websites require users to pay for content after accessing a limited number of pages or news articles for free each month. Our ability to build a subscriber base on our digital platforms depends on market acceptance, consumer habits, pricing, terms of delivery platforms and other factors. Stagnation or a decline in website traffic levels may adversely affect our advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenue. In order to retain and grow our digital subscription base and audience, we may have to further evolve our digital subscription model, address changing consumer requirements and develop and improve our digital products while continuing to deliver high-quality journalism and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain and increase our digital subscription base and audience or that we will be able to do so without taking steps such as reducing pricing or increasing costs that would affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnological developments may also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our operating revenues and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. Our advertising and circulation revenues have declined, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including declining newspaper buying (by young people in particular) and the migration to other available forms of media for news. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices, fraudulent traffic generated by \u201cbots,\u201d or malware proliferate.\nAny changes we make to our business model to address these challenges may require significant capital investments. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in digital technologies. However, we may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure. Some of our competitors may have greater operational, financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to compete for opportunities and as a result, our digital businesses may be less successful, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets and our ability to maintain market share and generate operating revenues depends on how effectively we compete with our competition.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets. Our newspapers often times compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other newspapers as well as with other media such as the Internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, and yellow pages. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nOur operating revenues primarily consist of advertising and paid circulation. Competition for advertising expenditures and paid circulation comes from a variety of sources, including local, regional and national newspapers, the Internet, including news aggregation websites, social media websites and search engines, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, yellow pages, outdoor billboards, and other media. Free daily newspapers are available in several metropolitan markets, and there can be no assurance that free daily publications, or other publications, will not be introduced in any markets in which we publish newspapers. Competition for newspaper advertising revenue is based largely upon advertiser results, advertising rates, readership, demographics, and circulation levels. Competition for circulation is\nbased largely upon the content of the newspaper, its price, editorial quality, customer service, and other sources of news and information. Circulation revenue and our ability to achieve price increases for, or even maintain prices for, our print products may be affected by competition from other publications and other forms of media available in our various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items like newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time, and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among certain demographics. We may incur higher costs competing for advertising dollars and paid circulation. If we are not able to compete effectively for advertising dollars and paid circulation, our operating revenues may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur primary strategy is to transition from a print-focused media company to a digital platform media company, and if we are not successful in our transition, our business, financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully transition from a print-focused media company to a digital platform media company depends on various factors, including, among other things, the ability to:\n\u2022\nincrease digital audiences;\n\u2022\nincrease the amount of time spent on our websites, the likelihood of users returning to our websites, and their level of engagement;\n\u2022\nattract advertisers to our websites;\n\u2022\ntailor our products for mobile and tablet devices;\n\u2022\nmaintain or increase online advertising rates;\n\u2022\nexploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of competitors and develop new content, products and services; and\n\u2022\ninvest funds and resources in digital opportunities.\nThere are no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain employees with skill sets and knowledge base needed to successfully operate in a digital business structure, that our sales force will be able to effectively sell advertising in the digital advertising arena versus our historical print advertising business, or that we will be able to effect the operational changes necessary to transition to from a print-focused business to a digital-focused business. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities, and we may incur research and development costs in building, maintaining and evolving our technology infrastructure.\nThe sale of the California Properties and the Transition Services Agreement entered into in connection with such sale could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn June 18, 2018, we completed the sale of the California Properties. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the California Properties accounted for 33.0% of our total revenues. Without the California Properties, the scale and geographic scope of our operations are substantially decreased, which could negatively impact our negotiating power in both revenue matters such as advertising sales rates, as well as procurement activities such as newsprint purchase prices.\nAdditionally, in connection with the closing of the sale of the California Properties, we entered into a transition services agreement (\u201cTSA\u201d) with NantMedia Holdings, LLC (\u201cNantMedia\u201d), whereby the Company will provide back-office and operational services to NantMedia for up to 12 months after the transaction at negotiated rates approximating cost. NantMedia also provides a small number of transition services to the Company under the TSA. During January 2019, the TSA was extended to June 30, 2020 at the same pricing. During 2018, the Company recognized $17.2 million of revenue from provision of TSA services to NantMedia.\nUnder the TSA, either party may discontinue all or a portion of the services being provided by the other party upon 60 days advance notice. As TSA services are discontinued by NantMedia, our revenue will decrease. If we are unable to implement cost-control measures to offset the lost revenue, our net income would be negatively impacted.\nDecreases, or slow growth, in circulation may adversely affect our circulation and advertising revenues.\nOur newspapers, and the newspaper industry as a whole, are experiencing reduced consumer demand for print circulation and decreased circulation revenue. This results from, among other factors, increased competition from other media, particularly the online media outlets (which are often free to users), changing newspaper readership demographics and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper. These factors could affect our ability to implement circulation price increases, or even maintain current pricing, for our print\nproducts. As a result, our print circulation and circulation revenue may decline or may decline at a faster rate than anticipated.\nIn addition, our circulation revenue is sensitive to discretionary spending available to subscribers in the markets we serve, as well as their perceptions of economic trends and uncertainty. Weak economic indicators in various regions across the nation may adversely impact subscriber sentiment and therefore impair our ability to maintain and grow our circulation.\nA continued decline in circulation could affect the rate and volume of advertising revenue. To maintain a certain level of our circulation base, we may incur additional costs, and may not be able to recover these costs through circulation and advertising revenue. To address declining circulation, we may increase spending on marketing designed to retain our existing subscriber base and continue or create niche publications targeted at specific market groups. We may also increase marketing efforts to drive traffic to our proprietary websites.\nWe rely on revenue from the printing and distribution of publications for third parties that may be subject to many of the same business and industry risks that we are.\nIn 2018, we generated approximately 10.0% of our revenue from printing and distributing third-party publications. As a result, if the macroeconomic and industry trends described herein such as the sensitivity to perceived economic weakness of discretionary spending available to advertisers and subscribers, circulation declines, shifts in consumer habits and the increasing popularity of digital media affect those third parties, we may lose, in whole or in part, a substantial source of revenue, which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to execute cost-control measures successfully, our total operating costs may be greater than expected, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nWe continually assess our operations in an effort to identify opportunities to enhance operational efficiencies and reduce expenses. These activities have in the past included, and could include in the future, outsourcing of various functions or operations, additional abandonment of leased space, offering employee buyouts, amending retirement benefits and other activities that may result in changes to employee headcount. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on changes in operations during 2018. The Company expects to continue to take actions deemed appropriate to control expenses and enhance profitability but does not currently know whether or when any such actions will occur or the potential costs and expected savings. If we do not achieve expected savings, are unable to implement additional cost-control measures, or our operating costs increase as a result of investments in strategic initiatives, our total operating costs would be greater than anticipated. In addition, if we do not manage our costs properly, such efforts may affect the quality of our products and our ability to generate future revenues. Reductions in staff and employee benefits and changes to our compensation structure could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. Finally, depending on the actions taken and the timing of any such actions, the anticipated cost savings could be recognized in fiscal periods that do not correspond to the fiscal period(s) in which the charges are recognized. As a result, our net income trends could be impacted and more difficult to predict.\nSignificant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues. If we are not able to implement further cost-control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues, this could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNewsprint prices and availability may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control.\nNewsprint and ink expense was 6.1% of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 30, 2018. The price of newsprint has historically been subject to change, and the consolidation of North American newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers and the available supply of newsprint. We have historically been able to realize favorable newsprint pricing by virtue of our company-wide volume and a long-term contract with a significant supplier. Failure to maintain our current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain our existing relationships with our newsprint suppliers may adversely affect newsprint prices in the future.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the United States Department of Commerce reached preliminary determinations on tariffs related to countervailing duties and anti-dumping on Canadian imports of uncoated groundwood paper, which includes newsprint. The countervailing duty tariffs ranged from 4.4% to 9.9%. The anti-dumping tariffs ranged from 0% to 22%. On August 29, 2018, the International Trade Commission reached a negative determination on both countervailing duties and\nanti-dumping tariffs, stating that these imports do not cause material harm to the U.S. paper industry and the tariffs were terminated. In the intervening months between the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s preliminary determination and the final determination on August 29, 2018, newsprint prices both directly and indirectly rose dramatically, wholly or partially as a result of the pending duties. As a result of this final determination, duties submitted in the intervening months will not be collected from the importers of record. Since the final determination, we have seen very little effort by newsprint suppliers to rescind price increases, which were wholly or partially due to pending duty and tariff determinations. As a result, we may continue to experience high newsprint prices for an indeterminate amount of time.\nWe may not be able to adapt to technological changes.\nAdvances in technologies or alternative methods of content delivery or changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies have had and could continue to have a negative effect on our business. We cannot predict the effect such technologies will have on our operations. In addition, the expenditures necessary to implement these new technologies could be substantial and other companies employing such technologies before we are able to do so could aggressively compete with our business.\nTechnological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit our ability to protect intellectual property rights.\nWe seek to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by us may not prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology may increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. Protection of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for various services.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for various services. We do not control the operation of these service providers. If any of these third-party service providers terminate their relationship with us, or do not provide an adequate level of service, it could be disruptive to our business as we seek to replace the service provider or remedy the inadequate level of service. This disruption may adversely affect our operating results.\nSignificant problems with our key systems or those of our third-party service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe systems underlying the operations of each of our businesses are complex and diverse, and must efficiently integrate with third-party systems, such as wire feeds, video playout systems and credit card processors. Key systems include, without limitation, billing, website and database management, customer support, editorial content management, advertisement and circulation serving and management systems, information technology and communications systems, print and insert production systems, and internal financial systems. Some of these systems and/or support thereof are outsourced to third parties. We or our third-party service providers may experience problems with these systems. All information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. The continued and uninterrupted performance of our key systems is critical to our success. Unanticipated problems affecting these systems could cause interruptions in our services. In addition, if our third-party service providers face financial or other difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted. Any significant errors, damage, failures, interruptions, delays, or other problems with our systems, our backup systems or our third-party service providers or their systems could adversely impact our ability to satisfy our customers or operate our businesses and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business, operating results and reputation may be negatively impacted, and we may be subject to legal and regulatory claims if there is a loss, destruction, disclosure, misappropriation or alteration of or unauthorized access to data owned or maintained by us, or if we are the subject of a significant data breach or cyberattack.\nWe rely on our information technology and communications systems to manage our business data, including communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. These technologies and systems also help us manage many of our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and financial systems. Attempts to compromise information technology and communications systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches resulting from accidental events (such as human error) or deliberate attacks. Moreover, the techniques used to attempt attacks and the perpetrators of such attacks are constantly expanding. We face threats both from use of malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware), employee theft or misuse, advanced persistent threats, and phishing and denial-of-service attacks. For example, in December 2018, the Company was attacked by a ransomware virus, which locked up certain Company systems and data, requiring implementation of components of the Company\u2019s business continuity plans and restoration of data from backups. The Company investigated the incident and determined that it did not result in any unauthorized access to or acquisition of sensitive data stored within its systems. Additionally, in late 2018, the Company identified and investigated unrelated activity involving unauthorized access gained to Company certain staff email accounts and payroll-related user accounts, which was the result of email phishing attacks. The Company is complying with all applicable legal requirements relating to this activity and is taking steps to implement additional safeguards to reduce the risk of successful email phishing attacks. Neither the malware infection nor the email phishing attacks resulted in any material costs to the Company. As cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, and as tools and resources become more readily available to malicious third parties, the Company will incur increased costs to secure its technology environment and there can be no guarantee that our and our third-party vendors\u2019 actions, security measures and controls designed to prevent, detect or respond to security breaches, to limit access to data, to prevent destruction, alteration, or exfiltration of data, or to limit the negative impact from such attacks, can provide absolute security against compromise. As a result, our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes may be lost, destroyed, disclosed, misappropriated, altered or accessed without consent and various controls, automated procedures and financial systems could be compromised.\nA significant security breach or other successful attack could result in significant remediation costs, including repairing system damage, engaging third-party experts, deploying additional personnel or vendor support, training employees, and compensation or incentives offered to third parties whose data has been compromised. These incidents may also lead to lost revenues resulting from a loss in competitive advantage due to the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, destruction or use of business data, the failure to retain or attract customers, the disruption of critical business processes or systems, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. Moreover, such incidents may result in adverse media coverage, which may harm our reputation. These incidents may also lead to legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions and private lawsuits, and related legal fees, as well as potential settlements, judgments and fines. We maintain insurance, but the coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nOur possession and use of personal information, including payment methods of our customers, present risks and expenses that could harm our business. A security breach involving such data, whether through breach of our security measures or otherwise, could expose us to liabilities and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nOur information technology and communications systems store and process subscriber, employee and other personal information, such as names, email addresses, payment method information, addresses, personal health information, social security numbers, and other personal information. Maintaining the security of this information and our systems is critical. Additionally, we depend on the security of our third-party service providers. Unauthorized use of or inappropriate access to our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, information technology and communications systems could jeopardize the security of this personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage information technology and communications systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Non-technical means, for example, actions or omissions by an employee, can also result in a security breach. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate the personal information relating to our customers, users or employees. As a result of any such breaches, we may be subject to legal claims, and these events may adversely impact our reputation and interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which\nmay have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nA significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all amounts charged by us. These customers provide payment card information and other personal information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we or our third-party vendors fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that any security measures we, or our third-party service providers, take will be effective in preventing a security breach or that we or our third -party service providers may make some other act or omission that could result in a security breach. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers or users. Failure to protect personal information of our customers and employees or to provide affected individuals with adequate notice of any security breach where required by law could also subject us to liabilities imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies or courts.\nPrivacy-related laws are constantly evolving and may increase our compliance costs and potential for liability, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting privacy or data protection laws and regulations that apply to the processing or protection of personal information, including laws at the city, state and federal level in the United States. For instance, these laws and regulations may impose additional security breach notification requirements, notice and consent requirements and specific data security obligations, and may also provide for a private right of action or statutory damages. The compliance costs and operational burdens imposed by these laws and regulations could be significant. Additionally, as these laws and regulations continue to evolve and continue to be interpreted by courts and regulators, compliance may result in increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement, litigation, damages and sanctions. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) on June 28, 2018, which takes effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents several additional rights, including the right to access and delete their personal information, restrict certain personal information sharing, and receive greater transparency about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a limited private right of action for security breaches that is expected to increase security breach litigation. The CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and compliance costs and adversely affect our business. The law has already been amended and may be amended again before it goes into effect. Additionally, the California Attorney General\u2019s office is expected to issue interpretive rules. These changes make it difficult to predict how the CCPA will affect our business or operations. Aside from actions by state legislatures, the FTC and state attorneys general are active in enforcing against alleged privacy and data protection failures through authority granted to them under broad consumer protection laws, which could also create potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nIf in the future, we decide to expand any existing or future lines of our business outside of the United States, we may become subject to additional privacy and data protection obligations by other nations\u2019 privacy laws. For example, an expansion into European Union countries may subject us to the European Union\u2019s existing data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d). The GDPR has several very specific and often burdensome compliance requirements that apply to the processing personal data, including stringent conditions for consent when relied upon for processing, granting of rights for individuals (including erasure, access, portability and rectification), conditions applicable to the trans-border flow of such data, more burdensome security breach reporting and other requirements. The GDPR also has significant penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million Euros, or approximately 23 million U.S. dollars, or 4% of an entity\u2019s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities and private citizens. The European Union is also considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communication (e-Privacy) Directive with a regulation to, among other things, amend the current directive\u2019s rules on the use of cookies and email marketing.\nOur failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations, foreign or domestic, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with laws and regulations that govern our business operations, as well as any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our own posted policies, could result in claims against us by governmental entities or others and/or increased costs to change our practices. They could also result in negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us by our users and advertisers. All of these potential consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur brands and reputation are key assets, and negative perceptions or publicity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur brands are key assets of the Company, and our success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands. We believe that our brands are trusted by consumers and have excellent reputations for high-quality journalism and content. To the extent consumers perceive the quality of our products to be less reliable or our reputation is damaged, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technology. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected as a result.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we are party to litigation, including matters relating to alleged libel or defamation, breaches of fiduciary duties by our Board of Directors, employment-related matters, or claims that may provide for statutory damages, in addition to regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. The coverage, if any, and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for all costs and/or losses associated with lawsuits or investigations. If we are not successful in our defense of any claims that may be asserted against us and/or those claims are not covered by insurance or exceed our insurance coverage, we may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our officers and directors from damage awards that may be entered against them and pay the costs and expenses incurred in defense of, or in any settlement of, such claims. Any such payments or settlement arrangements could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows if the claims are not covered by our insurance carriers or if damages exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. Furthermore, regardless of the outcome of any claims that may be filed against us, defending litigation itself could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations.\nIn some instances, third parties may have an obligation to indemnify us for liabilities related to litigation or governmental investigations, and may be unable to, or fail to fulfill such obligations. It is possible that the resolution of one or more such legal matters could result in significant monetary damages. If such third parties were to fail to indemnify us, we would be responsible for the monetary damages, which could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow. As part of our 2015 acquisition of The San Diego Union-Tribune, the seller provided us a full indemnity with respect to a consolidated class action lawsuit that asserts various claims on behalf of home delivery newspaper carriers alleged to have been misclassified as independent contractors. If the seller in The San Diego Union-Tribune were to fail to indemnify us for the payment of settlement amounts, we would be responsible for the monetary damages, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe may not achieve the acquisition component of our business strategy, or successfully complete strategic acquisitions, investments or divestitures.\nWe continuously evaluate our businesses and make strategic acquisitions, investments and divestitures as part of our strategic plan. These transactions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. There can be no assurance that any such acquisitions, investments or divestitures can be completed.\nAcquisitions are an important component of our business strategy; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business through acquisitions, that any businesses acquired will perform in accordance with expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including (i) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits; (ii) potential adverse short-term effects on operating results through increased costs or otherwise; (iii) diversion of management\u2019s attention and failure to recruit new, and retain existing, key personnel of the acquired business; (iv) stockholder dilution if an acquisition is consummated (in whole or in part) through an issuance of our securities; (v) failure to successfully implement systems integration; (vi) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business; (vii) the risks inherent in the systems of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations (viii) exceeding the capability of our systems; (ix) problems implementing disclosure controls and procedures for the newly acquired business; and (x) unforeseen difficulties extending internal control over financial reporting and performing the required assessment at the newly acquired business.\nOur ability to execute an acquisition strategy may also encounter limitations in completing transactions. Among other considerations, we may not be able to obtain necessary financing on attractive terms or at all, and we may face regulatory considerations that limit the candidates with whom we are permitted to proceed or may impose transaction execution delays. Future acquisitions may result in the Company incurring debt and contingent liabilities, pension obligations, an increase in interest and amortization expense and significant charges relative to integration costs. Our strategy could be impeded if we do not identify suitable acquisition candidates and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected if we overpay for acquisitions. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may prove not to advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected returns.\nStrategic investments are an important component of our business strategy as well. Investments in other companies expose us to the risk that we may not be able to control the operations of the companies we have invested in, which could decrease the benefits we realize from a particular relationship. The success of these investments is dependent on the companies we invest in, as well as other investors. We also are exposed to the risk that a company in which we have made an investment may encounter financial difficulties, which could lead to disruption of that company\u2019s business or operations. Further, our ability to monetize the investments and/or the value we may receive upon any disposition may depend on the actions of the companies we have invested in and other investors. As a result, our ability to control the timing or process relating to a disposition may be limited, which could adversely affect the liquidity of these investments or the value we may ultimately attain upon disposition. If the value of the companies in which we invest declines, we may be required to record a charge to earnings. There can be no assurances that we will receive a return on these investments or that they will result in revenue growth or will produce equity income or capital gains in future years.\nIf we are unable to successfully operate our business in new markets we may enter, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPart of our strategy is to expand through both organic and inorganic growth. For example, we expanded the geographic scope of our business in 2018 through the acquisition of The Virginian-Pilot. In addition, through our acquisition of a 60% membership interest in BestReviews LLC in 2018, we expanded into a new line of business of testing, researching and reviewing consumer products. Our future financial results will depend in part on our ability to profitably manage our business in these and any other new markets that we may enter. In order to successfully execute on our growth initiatives, we will need to, among other things, anticipate and react to market conditions and develop expertise in areas outside of our business\u2019s traditional core competencies. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nContinued economic uncertainty and the impact on our business or changes to our business and operations may result in goodwill and masthead impairment charges.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Erosion of general economic, market or business conditions could have a negative impact on our business and stock price, which may require that we record impairment charges in the future, which negatively affects our results of operations. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe assumed underfunded pension liabilities as part of the New York Daily News acquisition and our pension obligations under this plan, or other pension plans we may assume in future acquisitions, could increase.\nIn connection with acquisitions, we have in the past assumed, and may in the future assume, single-employer and/or multi-employer pension obligations of the acquired entity(ies) which may or may not be fully funded at the time of acquisition. In connection with our acquisition of the New York Daily News, we assumed the Daily News Retirement Plan (the \u201cNYDN Pension Plan\u201d) which is currently underfunded. The Company\u2019s contributions to the NYDN Pension Plan were $3.9 million in fiscal 2018. The unfunded status of the NYDN Pension Plan is $19.2 million as actuarially determined as of December 30, 2018. Our pension funding requirements could increase due to a reduction in the plan\u2019s funded status. The extent of underfunding of this plan is directly affected by a variety of factors, including performance of financial markets, changing interest rates, changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate or expected returns, and liquidity of the plan\u2019s investments. It also is affected by the rate and age of employee retirements, along with actual experience compared to actuarial projections. These items affect pension plan assets and the calculation of pension obligations and expenses. Such changes could increase the cost to our obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and our ability to meet those obligations. In addition, changes in the law, rules, or governmental regulations with respect to pension funding could also materially and adversely affect cash flow and our ability to meet our pension obligations.\nOur annual pension funding obligations could also further increase if we assume additional pension plans (whether or not unfunded) in connection with future acquisitions. No assurances can be made regarding whether we will assume other pension plan obligations and, if we do, the level of any underfunded status, if any.\nWe may be obligated to make greater contributions to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that cover our union-represented employees in the next several years than previously required, placing greater liquidity needs upon our operations.\nAs of December 30, 2018, we participate in, and make periodic contributions to ten multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer withdraws from or otherwise ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. Our required contribution to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or the other funding deficiencies. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan will depend on the nature and timing of any triggering event and the extent of that plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits.\nUnder federal pension law, special funding rules apply to multiemployer pension plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201c critical and declining.\u201d If plans in which we participate are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply and/or we could be required to make additional contributions. Five of the multiemployer plans we contribute to are in critical and declining status and project insolvency at various dates within the next 12 years. As such four of these plans have implemented rehabilitation plans designed to enable them to emerge from critical status within the time frame stipulated by the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d). One of these plans adopted a rehabilitation plan in connection with merging the plan with a healthy multiemployer plan. The merger is subject to approval by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d), which is not assured. The fifth plan was not able to implement a rehabilitation plan that would enable it to emerge from critical status and therefore adopted a rehabilitation plan that reflects reasonable measures to forestall\ninsolvency. Rehabilitation plans are required to be reviewed annually and modified if necessary to meet federal requirements. Therefore, there can be no assurances that the funding obligations under the rehabilitation plans will not increase in the future or that the rehabilitation plans will be successful in preventing or forestalling the projected insolvency of the multiemployer plans.\nGiven the critical and declining status of the four plans, the trustees may amend the current, or adopt new, rehabilitation plans with increased funding obligations. Trustees of a plan or the PBGC also may decide to terminate a multiemployer plan rather than permit it to become insolvent, and a termination would result in additional liabilities for the participating employers.\nWith respect to four of the ten multiemployer defined benefit pension plans to which we are obligated to contribute, we are among only a limited number of participating employers. As a result, if one or more of the other contributing employers withdraws from, or ceases to contribute to, such plans, our required contributions to such plans could increase. A withdrawal by a significant percentage of participating employers may result in a mass withdrawal, which would require us to record additional withdrawal liabilities. Additionally, if we are the last remaining participating employer in such plan, we may become obligated to fund the plan\u2019s future liabilities more quickly as if it were a single employer plan and the unfunded liability could reside on our financial statements which would impact our financial statements.\nIf, in the future, we elect to withdraw from an underfunded multiemployer plan, or if we trigger a partial withdrawal due to declines in contribution base units or a partial cessation of our obligation to contribute, additional liabilities would be required to be recorded that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We are not currently able to quantify such potential increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on individual multiemployer plans.\nLabor strikes, lockouts and protracted negotiations can lead to business interruptions and increased operating costs.\nAs of December 30, 2018, union employees comprised approximately 24.5% of our workforce. We are required to negotiate collective bargaining agreements across our business units on an ongoing basis. Complications in labor negotiations can lead to work slowdowns or other business interruptions and greater overall employee costs. Additionally, certain of our employee groups could elect to unionize in the future. If we or our suppliers are unable to negotiate new or renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect our business by disrupting our ability to provide customers with our products or services. Depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or work stoppage may have an adverse effect on our operating revenues, cash flows or operating income or the timing thereof.\nOur revenues and operating results fluctuate on a seasonal basis and may suffer if revenues during the peak season do not meet our expectations.\nOur advertising business is seasonal, and our quarterly revenues and operating results typically exhibit seasonality. Our revenues and operating results tend to be higher in the second and fourth quarters than the first and third quarters. Results for the second quarter reflect spring advertising revenues, while the fourth quarter includes advertising revenues related to the holiday season. Our operating results may suffer if advertising revenues during the second and fourth quarters do not meet expectations. Our working capital and cash flows also fluctuate as a result of this seasonality. Moreover, the operational risks described elsewhere in these risk factors may be significantly exacerbated if those risks were to occur during the fourth quarter.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract, integrate and retain our senior management team.\nWe rely heavily on the skills and expertise of our senior management team and therefore, our success depends, in part, upon the services they provide us. For example, in January 2019, we appointed a new Chief Executive Officer and new Chairman of the Board. If we are unable to assimilate these new senior managers, if they or our other leaders fail to perform effectively, if we are unable to retain them, or if we are unable to attract additional qualified senior managers as needed, our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to access the credit and capital markets at the times and in the amounts needed and on acceptable terms.\nFrom time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (1) our financial performance, (2) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nIf the distribution of Tribune\u2019s shares by TCO described below does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the IRC, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of TCO or Tribune, then TCO may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes, and Tribune may be obligated to indemnify TCO for such taxes imposed on TCO as a result thereof.\nTCO spun-off essentially all of its publishing business into an independent company (the \u201cDistribution\u201d). TCO received a private letter ruling (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) to the effect that the Distribution and certain related transactions qualify as tax-free to TCO, Tribune and the TCO stockholders and warrantholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, the IRS Ruling does not rule that the Distribution satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution, and the parties rely solely on the opinion of counsel described below for comfort that such additional requirements are satisfied.\nIn connection with the Distribution, TCO received an opinion of special tax counsel to TCO to the effect that the Distribution and certain related transactions qualify as tax-free to TCO and the stockholders and warrantholders of TCO. The opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel relied on the IRS Ruling as to matters covered by it.\nThe IRS Ruling and the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel are based on, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by TCO and certain of the TCO stockholders. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the IRS Ruling or the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel. An opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the IRS Ruling and the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel are based on then current law, and cannot be relied upon if the law changes with retroactive effect.\nAmong other reasons, the Distribution would be taxable to TCO pursuant to Section 355(e) of the IRC if there is a 50% or more change in ownership of either TCO or Tribune, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. Section 355(e) might apply if other acquisitions of stock of TCO before or after the Distribution, or of Tribune after the Distribution, are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. If Section 355(e) applied, TCO might recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain.\nUnder the tax matters agreement, in certain circumstances, and subject to certain limitations, we are required to indemnify TCO against taxes on the Distribution that arise as a result of our actions or failures to act after the Distribution.\nWe may incur significant costs to address contamination issues at certain sites operated or used by our publishing businesses.\nWe may incur costs in connection with the investigation or remediation of contamination at sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us. In connection with the Distribution, we agreed to indemnify TCO for claims or expenses related to certain identified environmental issues. The identified issues generally relate to sites previously owned, operated or used by the Company\u2019s publishing businesses and in some cases, continue to be used for our publishing businesses at which contaminations were identified. Historically, our publishing business was obligated to investigate and remediate contamination at certain of these sites. We were also required to contribute to cleanup costs at certain of these sites that were third-party waste disposal facilities at which it disposed of its wastes. In addition, we acquired real property in connection with our acquisitions of the New York Daily News and The Virginian-Pilot, which includes sites at which contaminations were identified. The sellers in these acquisitions have agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, but we may have additional investigation and remediation obligations and be required to contribute to cleanup costs at these facilities. We could have additional investigation and remediation obligations and be required to contribute to cleanup costs at these\nfacilities. Environmental liabilities, including investigation and remediation obligations, could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nMacroeconomic trends may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating revenues are sensitive to discretionary spending available to advertisers and subscribers in the markets we serve, as well as their perceptions of economic trends and uncertainty. Weak economic indicators, such as high unemployment rates, weakness in housing, fuel prices and uncertainty regarding the national and state governments\u2019 ability to resolve fiscal issues, may adversely impact advertiser and subscriber sentiment. These types of conditions could impair our ability to maintain and grow our advertiser and subscriber bases.\nEvents beyond our control may result in unexpected adverse operating results.\nOur results could be affected in various ways by global or domestic events beyond our control, such as wars, political unrest, acts of terrorism, natural disasters and Internet outages. Such events can quickly result in significant declines in advertising revenue and significant increases in newsgathering costs. There are no assurances that our business continuity or disaster recovery plans are adequate or that they will be implemented successfully if any such events were to occur.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, collectively:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our Board of Directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for elections as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or to amend our amended and restated by-laws.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of stockholders may consider such proposal, if effected, desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of the Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions may inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that may result from takeover attempts or speculation.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of March 13, 2019, our two largest shareholders are (1) Merrick Media, LLC (\u201cMerrick Media\u201d) and its affiliate Merrick Venture Management, LLC (\u201cMerrick Venture\u201d and together with Merrick Media, the \u201cMerrick Entities\u201d) which beneficially owned approximately 25.5% of our outstanding common stock, and (2) Nant Capital, together with Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, which beneficially owned approximately 24.6% of our outstanding common stock. Michael W. Ferro, Jr. is the sole managing member of Merrick Venture, which is the sole manager of Merrick Media. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is the indirect sole owner of Nant Capital. The interests of the Merrick Entities and Nant Capital may differ from those of the\nCompany\u2019s other stockholders. The Merrick Entities and Nant Capital are in the business of making investments in companies and maximizing the return on those investments. They currently may have and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain aspects of our business or that supply us with goods and services; provided, however, that pursuant to a Consulting Agreement with the Company, Mr. Ferro and Merrick Ventures have agreed to certain non-compete covenants in favor of the Company.\nDue to their significant stockholdings, the Merrick Entities and Nant Capital and their affiliates may be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. For additional information on the purchase agreements under which each of the Merrick Entities and Nant Capital acquired their shares, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders, do not apply to us.\nSubstantial sales, or stock issuances by us, of our common stock or the perception that such sales or issuances might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nAny sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including resales by our investors such as those to whom we have granted registration rights, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. Pursuant to the purchase agreements under which each of the Merrick Entities and Nant Capital acquired shares from us, certain of the restrictions on resales of those shares expired and, therefore, these stockholders could sell a significant number of shares either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient buying interest to offset any such public market sales, and, accordingly, the price of our common stock may be depressed by those sales and have periods of volatility.\nIn addition, we could from time to time issue new securities (debt or equity) or use treasury stock to fund potential acquisitions. For example, we used approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock held in treasury in connection with our acquisition of a 60% interest in BestReviews. Any issuance of common stock by us could dilute the ownership of current stockholders and could impact the price per share of our common stock. In addition, if we were to issue debt and/or preferred equity, the holders of such securities would have rights senior to those of our common stockholders. There can be no assurances whether we will issue additional securities in the future and, if so, how many and how such issuance could impact our current stockholders and our share price.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nMany factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to rise and fall, including the following: (i) declining newspaper print circulation; (ii) declining operating revenues derived from our core business; (iii) variations in quarterly results; (iv) announcements regarding dividends; (v) announcements of technological innovations by us or by competitors; (vi) introductions of new products or services or new pricing policies by us or by competitors; (vii) acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors; (viii) recruitment or departure of key personnel or key groups of personnel; (ix) the gain or loss of significant advertisers or other customers; (x) changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our stock; and (xi) market conditions in the newspaper industry, the media industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole.\nWe may be subject to the actions of activist shareholders, which could adversely impact our business.\nActivist shareholders and other third parties have made, or may in the future make, strategic proposals, including unsolicited takeover proposals, suggestions or requested changes concerning the Company\u2019s operations, strategy, governance, management, business or other matters. Responding to these campaigns or proposals can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees from our strategic initiatives. These activities can create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy, or leadership and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors and customers, and cause the price of our common stock to be depressed and have periods of volatility. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to the foregoing, and such matters may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our current initiatives, retain and attract key employees, and execute on our business strategy.\nWe do not currently pay cash dividends on our outstanding common stock, and our ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to limitations.\nWe currently do not pay quarterly common stock cash dividends. Any future determination to declare and pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account our financial results, capital requirements and other factors the Board may deem relevant. In addition, because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to pay distributions to us in an amount sufficient for us to pay dividends. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make such distributions will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition and the applicable provisions of Delaware law that may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to us.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the security or industry analysts downgrades our stock, ceases coverage of our company, fails to publish reports on us regularly, or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, demand for our stock may decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 14781, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "TPCO"}
