{"cik": "915779", "company": "DAKTRONICS INC /SD/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe factors that are discussed below, as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face significant competition and pricing pressure. If we are unable to keep up with the rapidly changing product market or compete effectively, we could lose market share and large project orders, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThe electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product improvement, innovations and development. We compete against products produced in foreign countries and the United States. In addition, our products compete with other forms of advertising, such as television, print media and fixed display signs. Our competitors may develop cheaper, more efficient products, or they may be willing to charge lower prices to increase their market share. Some competitors have more capital and other resources, which may allow them to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements. To remain competitive, we must anticipate and respond quickly to our customers\u2019 needs, enhance our existing products, introduce new products and features, and continue to price our products competitively.\nOur results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis are likely to fluctuate and are substantially affected by the size and timing of large contract order awards and conversion to net sales.\nOur net sales and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future. When awarded large contracts, primarily in the college and professional sports facilities markets, the OOH niche, transportation market, and the large spectacular niche, the timing and amount could cause material fluctuations in our net sales and earnings. Awards of large contracts and their timing and amount are difficult to predict, may not be repeatable, and are outside of our control. Operating results in one quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of future operating results. Some factors that may cause our operating results to vary include:\n\u2022\nnew product introductions;\n\u2022\nvariations in product mix;\n\u2022\nproduction capacity utilization; and\n\u2022\ndelays or cancellations of orders.\nOur actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur management is required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and assumptions as of the dates of our financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the recognition of contract revenue, costs, profits or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion; estimated amounts for warranty costs; the collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; the continuing utility of our property and equipment; the amount of estimated liabilities; the valuation of assets acquired plus liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed in acquisitions; the valuation of our deferred tax assets; and the valuation of stock-based compensation. If management's estimates and assumptions are not reasonable, our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely affected.\nUnanticipated warranty and other costs for defective products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reputation.\nWe provide warranties on our products with terms varying from one to 10 years. In addition, we offer extended warranties. These warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products and meet certain performance standards, among other customary warranty provisions. Although we continually monitor our warranty claims and accrue a liability for estimated warranty costs, unanticipated claims could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. During fiscal 2016, we discovered a warranty issue caused by a mechanical device failure within a module for displays primarily in our OOH application built prior to fiscal 2013. We increased our accrued warranty obligations by $1.8 million during fiscal 2017, $9.2 million during fiscal 2016 and $1.2 million during fiscal 2015 for probable and reasonably estimable costs to remediate this issue. See \"Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies\" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K for more information regarding our warranty accrual. In some cases, we may be able to subrogate a claim back to a subcontractor or supplier if the subcontractor or supplier supplied the defective product or performed the service, but this may not always be possible. In addition, the need to repair or replace products with design and manufacturing defects could adversely affect our reputation. The time required to remediate a claim may take time and could result in lost or deferred revenue, lead to costly warranty expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts on a regular basis, which could reduce our profits.\nAs part of our strategy, we enter into capped or fixed-price contracts. Because of the complexity of many of our client contracts, accurately estimating the cost, scope and duration of a particular contract can be a difficult task. If our actual costs exceed original estimates on fixed-price contracts, our profits will be reduced. Because of the large scale, customer timelines, seasonality of our business or long duration of some contracts, unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors including, but not limited to: increases in the cost or shortages of materials or labor; unanticipated technical problems; required project modifications not initiated by the customer; suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 failure to perform or delay in performing their obligations; and capacity constraints. In addition to increased costs, these factors could delay delivery of products which may result in the assessment of liquidated damages or other contractual damages. Unanticipated costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers or our payment of delay damages under fixed contracts would negatively impact our profits.\nBacklog may not be indicative of future revenue or profitability.\nMany of our products have long sales, delivery and acceptance cycles. In addition, our backlog is subject to order cancellations and delays. Orders normally contain cancellation provisions to permit our recovery of costs expended and a pro-rata portion of the profit. If projects are delayed, revenue recognition can occur over longer periods of time, and projects may remain in the backlog for extended periods of time. If we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter, fluctuations in the levels of the quarterly backlog can result because the backlog may reach levels which may not be sustained in subsequent quarters.\nUnanticipated events resulting in credit losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nSignificant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products. We closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and have not, to date, experienced significant credit losses. We mitigate our exposure to credit risk, to some extent, by requiring deposits, payments prior to shipment, progress payments and letters of credit. However, because some of our exposure to credit losses is outside of our control, unanticipated events resulting in credit losses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe depend on a single-source or a limited number of suppliers for our raw materials and components, and the loss of any of these suppliers or an increase in cost of raw materials could harm our business.\nWe obtain some of our raw materials from one or a limited number of suppliers. If we cannot obtain key raw materials from our suppliers, the raw materials may not be readily available from other suppliers, other suppliers may not agree to supply the materials to us on terms as favorable as the terms we currently receive, or the raw materials from any other suppliers may not be of adequate and consistent quality. Although we believe our supply of raw materials is adequate for the needs of our business, we cannot assure that new sources of supply will be available when needed. Any interruption in our supply of raw materials could affect our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is located and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we purchase various raw materials and components in order to manufacture our products. Historically, fluctuations in the prices of these raw materials and components have not had a material impact on our business. In the future, however, if we experience increases in the price of raw materials and components and are unable to pass on those increases to our customers, it could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGlobal geopolitical changes expose our operations to risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments, economic changes, unfavorable trading policies, and additional compliance with foreign and domestic governmental regulations or requirements.\nOur United States and foreign operations, sales, earnings, and strategies for profitable growth can be adversely affected by changes in treaty and trade relationships, changes in monetary and fiscal policies, changes in laws and regulations, or other activities of the United States and other foreign governments, agencies, and similar organizations. These conditions include, but are not limited to, changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions; pricing and marketing of products; local labor conditions and regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and burdensome taxes and tariffs and other trade regulations or barriers. Other exposures and uncertainties exist include changing social conditions and attitudes, terrorism, or political hostilities and war. The likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect on us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.\nWeakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions affect consumer spending and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our products, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, reduce the value of their contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nGlobal tax law changes may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States and its various state and local governments as well as several foreign jurisdictions. Our future income taxes could be materially adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings amongst countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, or the outcome of income tax audits and any related litigation.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of the United States and foreign jurisdictions could arise, including tax reform in the United States and the base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). Both the United States tax reform and the OECD proposed recommendations, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. These contemplated changes could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future results may be affected by legal compliance risks related to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws for the countries in which we operate.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and other similar regulations in other areas of the world. It also requires us to maintain specific record-keeping standards and adequate internal accounting controls. In addition, we are subject to similar requirements in other countries. Bribery, corruption, and trade laws and regulations, and the enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. Although we have internal policies and procedures with the intention of providing reasonable assurance of compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors, agents and licensees involved in our international sales may take actions in violations of such policies. If our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or similar laws and regulations, we may incur severe fines, penalties and reputational damage.\nWe may fail to continue to attract, develop and retain key management personnel, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe depend on the performance of our senior executives and key employees, including experienced and skilled technical personnel. The loss of any of our senior executives could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy. Our future success will also depend upon our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may negatively affect our business and operating results.\nWe increase our production capacity and the overhead supporting production based on anticipated market demand. Market demand, however, has not always developed as expected or remained at a consistent level. This underutilization risk can potentially decrease our profitability and result in the impairment of certain assets.\nThe following factors are among those that could complicate capacity planning for market demand:\n\u2022\nchanges in the demand for and mix of products that our customers buy;\n\u2022\nour ability to add and train our manufacturing staff in advance of demand;\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s pace of technological change;\n\u2022\nvariability in our manufacturing productivity;\n\u2022\nlong lead time for components used in production;\n\u2022\ngeography of the order and related shipping methods; and\n\u2022\nlong lead times for our plant and equipment expenditures.\nWe have been required to conduct a good faith reasonable country of origin analysis on our use of \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which has imposed and may impose additional costs on us and could raise reputational challenges and other risks.\nThe SEC has promulgated rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. As required annually, we filed Forms SD in May 2016 and May 2017 reporting our work performed to gain information on the source of conflict minerals we use. We incurred costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements. As we continue our due diligence, we may face reputational challenges if we continue to be unable to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products. We may also encounter challenges in our efforts to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, our financial statements may not be fairly stated, raising concerns for investors and potentially adversely affecting our stock price.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. We may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation, implementing improvements, or receiving a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, our assessment of internal controls may identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters which may raise concerns for investors and therefore adversely affect our stock price.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions become impaired, we could take significant non-cash charges against earnings.\nWe have pursued and will continue to seek potential acquisitions to complement and expand our existing businesses, increase our revenues and profitability, and expand our markets. As a result of prior acquisitions, we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as described in \"Note 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in charges against earnings, which would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods. During fiscal 2017, we recorded a technology and customer list intangible asset impairment of $0.8 million.\nAcquisitions and divestitures pose financial, management and other risks and challenges.\nWe routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets. Periodically, we may also consider disposing of certain assets, subsidiaries, or lines of business. Acquisitions or divestitures present financial, managerial and operational challenges. These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention;\n\u2022\ndifficulty with integrating acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty with the integration of different corporate cultures;\n\u2022\npersonnel issues;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown liabilities and indemnification obligations;\n\u2022\npotential disputes with the buyers or sellers;\n\u2022\nthe time involved in evaluating or modifying the financial systems of an acquired business; and\n\u2022\nestablishment of appropriate internal controls.\nThere can be no assurance that we will engage in any acquisitions or divestitures or that we will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits.\nThe terms and conditions of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations, and if we default on our credit facility, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and make us vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions.\nThe terms and conditions of our credit facilities impose restrictions limiting our ability to incur debt, merge, sell assets, make distributions (including cash dividends) and create or incur liens. The availability of credit facilities is also subject to certain covenants as explained in \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender could elect to declare any and all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. For additional information on financing agreements, see \"Note 9. Financing Agreements\" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nFor the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that borrowings from our existing credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities should provide sufficient funds to finance our capital expenditures, working capital and otherwise meet operating expenses and debt service requirements. However, if additional capital is required, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms. Also, market conditions can negatively impact our customers' ability to fund their projects and can impact our vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors and may not allow them to perform their obligations to us.\nIf we became unable to obtain adequate surety bonding or letters of credit, it could adversely affect our ability to bid on new work, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects.\nIn line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers and may be required to provide letters of credit. These bonds and letters of credit provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. If security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond or letter of credit on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to pursue that project. In addition, bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may be available only at significant additional cost as a result of general conditions that affect the insurance and bonding markets.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, or we may infringe upon the intellectual property of others, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights we use in our products and services. We may not be able to successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In particular, the laws of certain countries in which our products are sold do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws\nof the United States. If litigation is necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources even if we ultimately prevail.\nIn addition, intellectual property of others also has an impact on our ability to offer some of our products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors' patents or other intellectual property may limit our ability to offer products or services to our customers. Any infringement or claimed infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, products and services.\nThe outcome of pending and future claims or litigation can have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe can be a party to litigation in the normal course of business. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. Pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations or other liabilities to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurance fails to provide adequate coverage. Also, a well-publicized actual or perceived threat of litigation could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products.\nOur data systems could fail or their security could be compromised, causing a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely heavily on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business and for the collection and retention of business data. Any failure of our digital systems, or any breach of our systems\u2019 security measures, could adversely affect our operations, at least until our data can be restored and/or the breaches remediated. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming issues, and/or human errors or other similar events. Any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, whether by us or by our third-party service providers, could adversely affect our business and operations. Any disruption in our digital technologies could affect our business and operations, including our manufacturing and after sale servicing processes, severely damaging our reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and investors and exposing us to risk of litigation and liability.\nThe protections we have adopted and to which we are subject may discourage takeover offers favored by our shareholders.\nOur articles of incorporation, by-laws and other corporate governance documents and the South Dakota Business Corporation Act (SD Act) contain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many shareholders may find attractive. These provisions make it more difficult for our shareholders to take some corporate actions. These provisions relate to:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue undesignated shares on terms and with the rights, preferences and designations determined by the Board without shareholder action;\n\u2022\nthe classification of our Board of Directors, which effectively prevents shareholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of a shareholder rights plan providing for the exercise of common stock purchase rights when a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock (subject to certain exceptions);\n\u2022\nunder the SD Act, limitations on the voting rights of shares acquired in specified types of acquisitions and restrictions on specified types of business combinations; and\n\u2022\nunder the SD Act, prohibitions against engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless the business combination is approved.\nThese provisions may deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock, which in turn may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock has at times been thinly traded, which may result in low liquidity and price volatility.\nThe daily trading volume of our common stock has at times been relatively low. If this were to occur in the future, the liquidity and appreciation of our common stock may not meet our shareholders\u2019 expectations, and the prices at which our stock trades may be volatile. The market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted as a result of sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or by the perception such sales could cause.\nSignificant changes in the market price of our common stock could result in securities litigation claims against us.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate, and in the past, companies that have experienced significant changes in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities litigation claims. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio, press reports and blogs.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal shareholders have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval.\nDr. Aelred Kurtenbach served as our Chairman of the Board until September 3, 2014, when he retired. Mr. Reece Kurtenbach, who is Dr. Aelred Kurtenbach's son, serves as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Dr. Aelred Kurtenbach has two other children who serve as our Vice President of Human Resources and as our Vice President of Manufacturing. Together, these individuals, in the aggregate, beneficially owned 10.2% of our outstanding common stock as of June 5, 2017, assuming the exercise by them of all of their options that were currently exercisable or that vest within 60 days of June 5, 2017. In addition, our other executive officers and directors, in the aggregate, beneficially owned an additional 4.8% of our outstanding common stock as of June 5, 2017, assuming the exercise by them of all of their options currently exercisable or that vest within 60 days of June 5, 2017. While this does not represent a majority of our outstanding common stock, if these shareholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, could significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combination or reorganization. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other shareholders may desire. The interests of this group of shareholders may not always coincide with the interests of other shareholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other shareholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nUnexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts, fires, tornadoes, floods and severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate may disrupt our operations as well as the operations of our customers. Such acts could create additional uncertainties, forcing customers to reduce, delay, or cancel already planned projects. These events could result in damage to, and a complete or partial closure of, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, which could make it difficult to supply our customers with product and provide our employees with work, thereby adversely affecting our business, operating results or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 80233, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "DAKT"}
