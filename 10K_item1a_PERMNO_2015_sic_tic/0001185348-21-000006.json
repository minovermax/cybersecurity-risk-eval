{"cik": "1185348", "company": "PRA GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully read the following discussion of material factors, events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risk factors affecting our business, these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face, and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may have an adverse effect on our business, performance or financial condition in the future.\nOperational and Industry Risks\nThe continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial results.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the continuing COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, results of operations and financial results due to numerous evolving factors such as the extent to which vaccines will be available and their effectiveness against mutations of COVID-19. However, the continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results if:\n\u2022the current deterioration in the economic and inflationary environment resulting from the pandemic worsens or continues throughout 2021;\n\u2022political, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic prevent us from performing our collection activities or result in material increases in our costs to comply with such laws and regulations;\n\u2022consumers respond to COVID-19 by failing to pay amounts owed to us as a result of their unemployment or other factors that impact their ability to make payments;\n\u2022we are unable to maintain staffing levels necessary to operate our business due to extended lockdowns, governmental actions that result in our business operations being deemed non-essential or continued spread of COVID-19 causing employees to be unable or unwilling to work;\n\u2022we are unable to collect on existing nonperforming loans or experience material decreases in our cash collections;\n\u2022we are unable to purchase nonperforming loans needed to operate our business because credit originators become unable or unwilling to sell their nonperforming loans consistent with historical levels; or\n\u2022we suffer a cybersecurity incident as a result of increased vulnerability while a larger number of our employees work remotely.\nA deterioration in the economic or inflationary environment in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur performance may be adversely affected by economic, political or inflationary conditions in any market in which we operate. These conditions could include regulatory developments, changes in global or domestic economic policy, legislative changes, the sovereign debt crises experienced in several European countries and the uncertainty regarding the EU\u2019s future as a result of the UK's departure from the EU. Deterioration in economic conditions, or a significant rise in inflation could cause personal bankruptcy and insolvency filings to increase, and the ability of consumers to pay their debts could be adversely affected. This may in turn adversely impact our business and financial results.\nIf global credit market conditions and the stability of global banks deteriorate, the amount of consumer or commercial lending and financing could be reduced, thus reducing the volume of nonperforming loans available for purchase, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and ability to succeed in international markets.\nOther factors associated with the economy that could influence our performance include the financial stability of the lenders on our bank loans and credit facilities and our access to capital and credit. The financial turmoil that adversely affected\nthe banking system and financial markets during the prior global recession beginning in 2007 resulted in the tightening of credit markets. While the banking system and financial markets recovered from the prior recession, a worsening of current conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a negative impact on our business, including the insolvency of lending institutions, notably the lenders providing our bank loans and credit facilities, resulting in our difficulty in or inability to obtain credit. These and other economic factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to continually replace our nonperforming loans with additional portfolios sufficient to operate efficiently and profitably, and/or we may not be able to purchase nonperforming loans at appropriate prices.\nTo operate profitably, we must purchase and service a sufficient amount of nonperforming loans to generate revenue that exceeds our expenses. Costs such as salaries and other compensation expense constitute a significant portion of our overhead and, if we do not replace the nonperforming loan portfolios we service with additional portfolios, we may have to reduce the number of our collection personnel. We would then, have to rehire collection staff if we subsequently obtain additional portfolios. These practices could lead to negative consequences including the following:\n\u2022low employee morale;\n\u2022fewer experienced employees;\n\u2022higher training costs;\n\u2022disruptions in our operations;\n\u2022loss of efficiency; and\n\u2022excess costs associated with unused space in our facilities.\nThe availability of nonperforming loan portfolios at prices that generate an appropriate return on our investment depends on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022the continuation of high levels of consumer debt obligations;\n\u2022sales of nonperforming loan portfolios by credit originators; and\n\u2022competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and credit originators of receivables.\nFurthermore, heightened regulation of the credit card and consumer lending industry or changing credit origination strategies may result in decreased availability of credit to consumers, potentially leading to a future reduction in nonperforming loans available for purchase from credit originators. We cannot predict how our ability to identify and purchase nonperforming loans and the quality of those nonperforming loans would be affected if there were a shift in lending practices, whether caused by changes in the regulations or accounting practices applicable to credit originators or purchasers, a sustained economic downturn or otherwise.\nMoreover, there can be no assurance that credit originators will continue to sell their nonperforming loans consistent with historical levels or at all, or that we will be able to bid competitively for those portfolios. Because of the length of time involved in collecting on acquired portfolios and the variability in the timing of our collections, we may not be able to identify trends and make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner. If we are unable to maintain our business or adapt to changing market needs as well as our current or future competitors, we may experience reduced access to nonperforming loan portfolios at appropriate prices and, therefore, reduced profitability.\nWe may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our nonperforming loans to fund our operations.\nOur principal business consists of purchasing and collecting nonperforming loans that consumers or others have failed to pay. The credit originators have typically made numerous attempts to recover on their receivables, often using a combination of in-house recovery efforts and third-party collection agencies. These nonperforming loans are difficult to collect, and we may not collect a sufficient amount to cover our investment and the costs of running our business.\nOur collections may decrease if certain types of insolvency proceedings and bankruptcy filings involving liquidations increase.\nVarious economic trends and potential changes to existing legislation may contribute to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy and insolvency filings. Under certain of these filings, a debtor's assets may be sold to repay creditors, but because most of the receivables we collect through our collections operations are unsecured, we typically would not be able to collect on those receivables. Although our insolvency collections business could benefit from an increase in personal bankruptcies and insolvencies, we cannot ensure that our collections operations business would not decline with an increase in personal insolvencies or bankruptcy filings or changes in related regulations or practices. If our actual collection experience\nwith respect to a nonperforming or insolvent bankrupt receivables portfolio is significantly lower than the total amount we projected when we acquired the portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nGoodwill impairment charges could negatively impact our net income and stockholders' equity.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill as a result of our business acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount, which could lead to the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge. These risks include:\n\u2022adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, the business climate, or the market for the entity's products or services;\n\u2022significant variances between actual and expected financial results;\n\u2022negative or declining cash flows;\n\u2022lowered expectations of future results;\n\u2022failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions;\n\u2022significant expense increases;\n\u2022a more likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion of, a reporting unit;\n\u2022the loss of key personnel;\n\u2022an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;\n\u2022significant increase in discount rates; or\n\u2022a sustained decrease in the price per share of our common stock.\nOur goodwill impairment testing involves the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment, including judgments regarding expected future business performance and market conditions. Significant changes in our assessment of such factors, including the deterioration of market conditions, could affect our assessment of the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\nOur loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nWe are involved in judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from our business activities. We establish accruals for potential liability arising from legal proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. However, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability. In addition, actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter, or in the aggregate. An unfavorable resolution of a legal proceeding or claim could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. For more information, refer to the \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters\" section of Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K (\"Note 15\").\nInternational Operations Risks\nOur international operations expose us to risks which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the U.S. This could expose us to adverse economic, industry and political conditions that may have a negative impact on our ability to manage our existing operations or pursue alternative strategic transactions, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global nature of our operations expands the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this section, including the following:\n\u2022changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls on currency conversion and the transfer of funds that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S. in a tax-efficient manner;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency restructurings, inflation or deflation and our ability to manage these fluctuations through a foreign exchange risk management program;\n\u2022different employee/employer relationships, laws and regulations, union recognition and the existence of employment tribunals and works councils;\n\u2022laws and regulations imposed by international governments, including those governing data security, sharing and transfer;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate or challenges to our interpretations and application of complex international tax laws;\n\u2022logistical, communications and other challenges caused by distance and cultural and language differences, each making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022volatility of global credit markets and the availability of consumer credit and financing in our international markets;\n\u2022uncertainty as to the enforceability of contract rights under local laws;\n\u2022the potential of forced nationalization of certain industries, or the impact on creditors' rights, consumer disposable income levels, flexibility and availability of consumer credit and the ability to enforce and collect aged or charged-off debts stemming from international governmental actions, whether through austerity or stimulus measures or initiatives, intended to control or influence macroeconomic factors such as wages, unemployment, national output or consumption, inflation, investment, credit, finance, taxation or other economic drivers;\n\u2022the presence of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws on our international operations;\n\u2022the impact on our day-to-day operations and our ability to staff our international operations given our changing labor conditions and long-term trends towards higher wages in developed and emerging international markets as well as the potential impact of union organizing efforts;\n\u2022potential damage to our reputation due to non-compliance with international and local laws; and\n\u2022the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives, consultants and other third-party vendors.\nAny one of these factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompliance with complex and evolving international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations could increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.\nWe operate on a global basis with offices and activities in a number of jurisdictions throughout the Americas, Europe and Australia. We face increased exposure to risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with complex international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, which could increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include those related to taxation and anti-corruption laws such as the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act. Given the complexity of these laws, there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach certain provisions of these laws, such as through the negligent behavior of an employee or our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations by us, any of our employees or our third-party vendors, either inadvertently or intentionally, could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our operations and ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries. Violations of these laws could also adversely affect our business, brand, international expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees and results of operations.\nThe UK's exit from the EU could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe UK exited the EU effective January 31, 2020 (\"Brexit\"). Although the parties have agreed on several terms governing their continuing relationship, matters such as data sharing and financial services remain unresolved. As a result of the recency of the agreement and the failure to reach agreement on significant matters, there remains uncertainty about Brexit\u2019s impact on taxes, foreign currency, political stability, economic, regulatory and financial market conditions in the UK, the EU and globally, the movement of goods, services, people and capital between the UK and EU.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the total estimated remaining collections (\"ERC\") of our UK portfolios constituted approximately 26% of our consolidated ERC. Our British pound assets are predominantly funded by British pound liabilities. However, British pound net income and retained earnings could be affected when translated to the U.S. dollar, positively or negatively, by foreign currency exchange volatility in the short term resulting from the uncertainty of Brexit. In the longer term, Brexit could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition depending on the terms negotiated by the UK and the EU concerning data sharing, taxes, financial services regulation and other matters that impact our operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur ability to collect and enforce our nonperforming loans may be limited under federal, state and international laws, regulations and policies.\nOur operations are subject to licensing and regulation by governmental and regulatory bodies in the many jurisdictions in which we operate. U.S. federal and state laws, and the laws and regulations of the international countries in which we operate, may limit our ability to collect on and enforce our rights with respect to our nonperforming loans regardless of any act or omission on our part. Some laws and regulations applicable to credit issuers may preclude us from collecting on nonperforming loans we acquire if the credit issuer previously failed to comply with applicable laws in generating or servicing those receivables. Collection laws and regulations also directly apply to our business. Such laws and regulations are extensive and subject to change. A variety of state, federal and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, transmission, sharing and security of consumer data. Consumer protection and privacy protection laws, changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced and any procedures that may be implemented as a result of regulatory consent orders may adversely affect our ability to collect on our nonperforming loans and adversely affect our business. Our failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to us could limit our ability to collect on our receivables, which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our business.\nFailure to comply with government regulation of the collections industry could result in penalties, fines, litigation, damage to our reputation or the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct our business.\nThe collections industry throughout the markets in which we operate is governed by various laws and regulations, many of which require us to be a licensed debt collector. Our industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, and subpoenas and other requests or demands for information may be issued by governmental authorities who are investigating debt collection activities. These investigations may result in enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and lawsuits. If any such investigations result in findings that we or our vendors have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of, or required modification to, our ability to conduct collections, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn a number of jurisdictions, we must maintain licenses to purchase or own debt, and/or to perform debt recovery services and must satisfy related bonding requirements. Our failure to comply with existing licensing requirements, changing interpretations of existing requirements, or adoption of new licensing requirements, could restrict our ability to collect in certain jurisdictions, subject us to increased regulation, increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to purchase, own and/or collect our receivables.\nSome laws, among other things, also may limit the interest rate and the fees that a credit originator may impose on our consumers, limit the time in which we may file legal actions to enforce consumer accounts and require specific account information for certain collection activities. In addition, local requirements and court rulings in various jurisdictions may affect our ability to collect.\nRegulations and statutes applicable to our industry further provide that, in some cases, consumers cannot be held liable for, or their liability may be limited with respect to, charges to their debit or credit card accounts that resulted from unauthorized use of their credit. These laws, among others, may limit our ability to recover amounts owing with respect to the receivables, whether or not we committed any wrongful act or omission in connection with the account.\nIf we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations discussed above, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or otherwise impact our ability to conduct collections efforts, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInvestigations, reviews or enforcement actions by governmental authorities may result in changes to our business practices; negatively impact our receivables portfolio acquisition volume; make collection of receivables more difficult; or expose us to the risk of fines, penalties, restitution payments and litigation.\nOur debt collection activities and business practices are subject to review from time to time by various governmental authorities and regulators, including the CFPB, which may commence investigations, reviews or enforcement actions targeted at businesses in the financial services industry. These investigations or reviews may involve individual consumer complaints or our debt collection policies and practices generally. Such investigations or reviews could lead to assertions by governmental authorities that we are not complying with applicable laws or regulations. In such circumstances, authorities may request or seek to impose a range of remedies that could involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, restitution payments, sanctions or injunctive relief, that if agreed to or granted, could require us to make payments or incur other\nexpenditures that could have an adverse effect on our financial position. The CFPB has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), recover costs, and impose monetary penalties (ranging from $5,000 per day to over $1 million per day, depending on the nature and gravity of the violation). In addition, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and other state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations under state law. Governmental authorities could also request or seek to require us to cease certain practices or institute new practices. Negative publicity relating to investigations or proceedings brought by governmental authorities could have an adverse impact on our reputation, harm our ability to conduct business with industry participants, and result in financial institutions reducing or eliminating sales of receivables portfolios to us which would harm our business and negatively impact our results of operations. Moreover, changing or modifying our internal policies or procedures, responding to governmental inquiries and investigations and defending lawsuits or other proceedings could require significant efforts on the part of management and result in increased costs to our business. In addition, such efforts could divert management's full attention from our business operations. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe CFPB has issued civil investigative demands to many companies that it regulates and periodically examines practices regarding the collection of consumer debt. As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 9, 2015, Portfolio Associates, LLC (\"PRA\"), our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a consent order with the CFPB effective September 9, 2015 settling a previously disclosed investigation of certain debt collection practices of PRA (the \"Consent Order\"). Although we have implemented the requirements of the Consent Order, there can be no assurance that additional litigation or new industry regulations currently under consideration by the CFPB would not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In fact, the CFPB has recently made civil investigative demands and advised the Company of the CFPB\u2019s belief that we may have violated certain provisions of the Consent Order and applicable law. Refer to Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nThe regulation of data privacy in the U.S and globally could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition by increasing our compliance costs.\nThe regulation of data privacy, including interpretations and determinations by regulatory authorities in the U.S. and in the countries in which we operate, continues to evolve. It is not possible to predict the effect of such rigorous data protection regulations over time. For example, GDPR impacts our European operations and required us to adapt our business practices accordingly. Financial penalties for noncompliance with the GDPR can be significant. It is also the case that the U.S. federal government and states within the U.S. have enacted or are considering legislation to enact data privacy protections. Data privacy regulations could result in increased costs of conducting business to maintain compliance with such regulations. Although we take significant steps to protect the security of our data and the personal data of our customers, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with regulations if third parties improperly obtain and use such data.\nChanges in tax provisions or exposures to additional tax liabilities could have an adverse tax effect on our financial condition.\nWe record reserves for uncertain tax positions based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, in determining whether a tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating that amount. Our tax filings are subject to audit by domestic and international tax authorities. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may adversely or beneficially affect our financial results in the period(s) for which such determination is made.\nFinancial and Liquidity Risks\nWe expect to use leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect the return on our assets.\nWe may incur a substantial amount of debt in the future. Our existing indebtedness is recourse to us, and we anticipate that future indebtedness will likewise be recourse. As of December 31, 2020, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $2.7 billion, all of which, except for $345.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.50% Convertible Notes due 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\") and $300.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 7.375% Senior Notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\"), was secured indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had total committed revolving borrowing capacity of $843.2 million available under our credit facilities, all of which if borrowed would be secured indebtedness. Considering borrowing base restrictions and other covenants, the amount available to be borrowed under our credit facilities would have been $408.0 million. Our management team will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of\nindebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of any new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets and the Company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service.\nIncurring a substantial amount of debt could have important consequences for our business, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, to our trade or other creditors;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is constrained;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022increasing the amount of interest expense because most of the indebtedness under our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates, which, if interest rates increase, will result in higher interest expense;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us through capital markets financings, under credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, repurchase our 2023 Notes upon a fundamental change or settle conversions in cash, repurchase our 2025 Notes upon a change of control or fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, at or before its scheduled maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations or to repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional debt or equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements. Our ability to access additional future borrowings could be negatively impacted as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global debt and capital markets.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our current and future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In the future, we may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from the collection of nonperforming loans to meet our cash requirements. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, we have to incur unforeseen expenses, we invest in acquisitions or make other investments that we believe will benefit our competitive position. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timeliness and amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Furthermore, our ability to refinance would depend upon the condition of the finance and credit markets. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, would materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and may delay or prevent the expansion of our business.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness include provisions that may restrict our financial and business operations.\nOur credit facilities and the indentures that govern our 2023 Notes and our 2025 Notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on how we operate our business and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. These restrictions may interfere with our ability to engage in other necessary or desirable business activities, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to satisfy any one of these covenants could result in negative consequences, including the following:\n\u2022acceleration of outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022exercise by our lenders of rights with respect to the collateral pledged under certain of our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022our inability to continue to purchase nonperforming loans needed to operate our business; or\n\u2022our inability to secure alternative financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nUncertainty about the future of the LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nIt is possible that beginning in 2022 LIBOR will be discontinued as a reference rate. It is unknown whether any proposed alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements or whether the outstanding issues related to them will be satisfactorily resolved. The availability of our borrowings and the operation of our derivative hedging agreements could be adversely impacted if LIBOR is discontinued and an agreement cannot be reached on an appropriate replacement benchmark rate between us and our lenders and counterparties.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\nA cybersecurity incident could disrupt our operations, compromise or corrupt our confidential information or damage our reputation, all of which could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions across markets and in multiple currencies. As we expand geographically, maintaining the security of our information technology systems and infrastructure becomes more significant and challenging. The three primary risks we face from a cybersecurity incident are operational disruption, the exposure of private data including, customer information, our employees' personally identifiable information, or proprietary business information such as underwriting and collections methodologies and reputational damage. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, some of which are internal, some hosted in the cloud and others we have outsourced.\nAlthough we take preventive steps, including patching our systems and infrastructure, monitoring and blocking malicious traffic with intrusion and detection prevention systems, monitoring firewalls to safeguard critical business applications, conducting regular external and internal security penetrations testing and supervising third party providers that have access to our systems, our computer systems, software and network, may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. To date, interruptions of our systems and infrastructure have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on operations. However, these measures, as well as our organization's increased awareness of our risk of a cybersecurity incident, do not guarantee that our business, reputation or financial results will not be impacted in a material adverse manner by such an incident. Should such a cybersecurity incident occur, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to notify affected consumers, modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. Additionally, we may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation costs and settlements and financial losses that may not be fully covered by our cybersecurity insurance.\nThe underperformance or failure of our information technology infrastructure, networks or communication systems could result in loss in productivity, loss of competitive advantage and business disruption.\nWe depend on effective information and communication systems to operate our business. We have also acquired and expect to acquire additional systems as a result of business acquisitions. Significant resources are required to maintain or enhance our existing information and telephone systems and to replace obsolete systems. Although we periodically upgrade, streamline, and integrate our systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, disruptions, and similar events. Failure to adequately implement or maintain effective and efficient information systems with sufficiently advanced technological capabilities, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could cause us to lose our competitive advantage, divert management\u2019s time, result in a loss of productivity or disrupt business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89574, "SIC": 6153, "TIC": "PRAA"}
