{"cik": "1053650", "company": "OMEGA PROTEIN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company cautions investors that the following risk factors, and those factors described elsewhere in this report, other filings made by the Company with the SEC from time to time and press releases issued by the Company, could affect the Company\u2019s actual results which could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nThe risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. The Company\u2019s business is also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations (including risks of strikes), general economic conditions and geopolitical events. Other risks not currently known to the Company or risks that the Company currently believes are immaterial may also materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Business and Industry:\nOmega Protein, the Company\u2019s largest operating subsidiary, is dependent on a single natural resource and may not be able to catch the amount of menhaden that it requires to operate profitably. Omega Protein\u2019s primary raw material is menhaden. Omega Protein\u2019s business is materially dependent on its annual menhaden harvest in ocean waters along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Omega Protein\u2019s ability to meet its raw material requirements through its annual menhaden harvest fluctuates from year to year and month to month due to natural and other conditions over which Omega Protein has no control, including varying fish populations, adverse weather conditions, fish disease, and disruptions like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. These conditions may prevent Omega Protein from operating profitably.\nOmega Protein\u2019s operations are geographically concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico where they are susceptible to regional adverse weather patterns such as hurricanes. Two of Omega Protein\u2019s three operating plants are located in the Gulf of Mexico (one in Louisiana and one in Mississippi), a region which has historically been subject to a late summer/early fall hurricane season. Omega Protein\u2019s Virginia facility has in the past also at times been adversely affected by hurricanes. In September 2008, Omega Protein\u2019s Abbeville and Cameron, Louisiana fish processing facilities were damaged by Hurricane Ike and were non-operational immediately after the hurricane. Operations at the Abbeville fish processing facility were restored to full capacity within two weeks, and the Cameron fish processing facility was fully functional prior to the beginning of the 2009 fishing season. In addition, all three of Omega Protein\u2019s Gulf of Mexico plants operated at the time were severely damaged within a one-month span by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in August and September 2005. Immediately after the second hurricane, approximately 70% of Omega Protein\u2019s 2004 production capacity was impaired and Omega Protein\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition were materially adversely affected. Additional future weather related disruptions could, if they occur, also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOmega Protein\u2019s operations are geographically concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico where they are susceptible to oil spills from offshore drilling, production and transportation activities. Two of Omega Protein\u2019s three operating plants are located in the Gulf of Mexico (one in Louisiana and one in Mississippi), a region which has historically had a high concentration of oil and gas infrastructure. If this infrastructure were to be become damaged due to natural or other disasters such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, then it is possible that environmental damages to the area and ecosystem could result. If these environmental damages occurred, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe closure of the Company\u2019s Cameron, Louisiana facility may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition. In December 2013, the Company streamlined its Gulf of Mexico operations through the permanent closure of its menhaden fish processing plant located in Cameron, Louisiana and the re-deployment of certain vessels from that facility. Accordingly, the Company re-deployed a portion of that facility\u2019s vessels and employees primarily to the Company\u2019s other Gulf Coast facilities located in Abbeville, Louisiana and Moss Point, Mississippi.\nThe Company took a pre-tax charge of $0 and $4.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for impairment and other charges related to buildings, vessels, machinery and equipment that will no longer be utilized.\nIn connection with the closure, the Company estimates that it will incur cash expenditures of approximately $0.6 million for non-cancellable facility lease rent payments and up to $0.1 million for equipment relocation costs.\nThe Company expects that it may have additional expenses related to (1) Ongoing site costs, including insurance, property taxes and security (2) obligations under its lease for the Cameron facility to remove certain improvements at the facility that may be requested by the landlord, and (3) environmental assessment and potential environmental clean-up costs associated with the facility. The Company cannot estimate what these costs may be at the current time.\nThe Company caught 70% of its 2013 fish catch in the Gulf of Mexico, and from 2011 to 2013 has caught an average of 69% of its fish catch in the Gulf of Mexico. Of the Gulf fish catch, 29% was caught by vessels originating from the Cameron facility in 2013, and from 2011 to 2013 an average of 27% of the Company\u2019s Gulf fish catch was caught by Cameron-based vessels. Of the seven vessels that fished from Cameron in 2013, the Company reassigned four vessels to its other Gulf of Mexico operations for fishing in 2014. In a normal fishing season, the Company would expect these reassigned vessels to catch approximately one fourth to one half of the fish catch that would otherwise have been caught by Cameron-based vessels.\nAfter adjusting for closure-related costs and assuming normal operating results and historical catch and yield averages, the closure did not have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s cost per ton for the 2014 fishing season.\nThe Company\u2019s decision to close the Cameron facility was predicated on some of the assumptions outlined above and it is possible these assumptions will turn out to be incorrect. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe expected benefits to be received and the expected costs and charges to be incurred in connection with the closing of the Cameron facility and re-deployment of certain vessels;\n\u25cf\namounts for removal of facility improvements and/or for environmental assessment and any potential clean-up costs;\n\u25cf\nassumptions about future cost per ton and revenue per ton being incorrect; and\n\u25cf\nassumptions about future fish catch by re-assigned fishing vessels being incorrect.\nIf any of the Company\u2019s assumptions regarding the Cameron closure are materially incorrect, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe closure of the Company\u2019s Cameron, Louisiana facility may result in potential unknown environmental liabilities which are not currently quantifiable. In connection with its closure of the Cameron, Louisiana fish processing facility in December 2013, the Company estimated various costs associated with the closure of that facility. Omega Protein\u2019s lease arrangements for the Cameron facility have included environmental indemnities from Omega Protein in favor of third-party landlords and obligations by Omega Protein to remove certain facility improvements and restore the leased property to certain prior existing conditions upon termination of the lease. Omega Protein has not terminated the lease and is continuing to make its rental payments under the lease which terminates in June 2022.\nThe Company is not aware of any material liability associated with the Cameron facility and accordingly has not accrued any costs associated with environmental liabilities. However, if such liabilities emerge or such property restoration costs become material, these liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nIf our Omega Protein subsidiary fails to comply with the terms of its probation under a plea agreement entered into in June 2013, we could be subject to criminal prosecution. In June 2013, Omega Protein, the Company\u2019s principal subsidiary, entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to resolve the previously disclosed government investigation related to the fishing vessels and operations of its Reedville, Virginia facility. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, the subsidiary pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to two felony counts under the Clean Water Act, paid a fine of $5.5 million, and made a $2.0 million contribution to an environmental fund.\nThe plea agreement and the terms of the court\u2019s sentencing order require Omega Protein to develop and implement an environmental compliance program at all of its facilities, and also imposed a three year period of probation. The Company has implemented a comprehensive compliance program which covers the areas addressed by the plea agreement. The U.S. Probation Office, in consultation with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Environmental Protection Agency, as necessary, have the right to monitor our compliance with these requirements during the term of probation.\nIn the event that Omega Protein does not comply with the terms of the plea agreement and the court\u2019s sentencing order, including the terms of probation, Omega Protein could be subject to additional criminal penalties or prosecution (including for the matters covered and resolved by the plea agreement). In addition, if Omega Protein fails to maintain compliance with the Clean Water Act or other similar environmental regulatory requirements in the future, Omega Protein could become subject to additional criminal or civil liability in connection with any such non-compliance. Omega Protein could also experience increased compliance costs, or alterations to the conduct of its normal course operations, in connection with these matters. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn addition, the convictions under the Clean Water Act will adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to secure government contracts with the United States, and secure future loans under the NFMS Title XI loan program in connection with the affected facility. The subsidiary has received notice from the EPA that it is ineligible, as a result of the convictions under the Clean Water Act, for receipt of government contracts, loans or benefits if any part of the work will be performed, or the loan collateral will be located, at the facility where the offense occurred.\nThe 2014 Atlantic menhaden benchmark stock assessment could form a basis for regulatory action that results in a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation. In 2014, the ASMFC and the National Marine Fisheries Service jointly conducted a new benchmark stock assessment for Atlantic menhaden, which utilized new data sources and a new statistical model. This assessment was the first comprehensive revisiting of the stock assessment model since 2001 and the first stock review since a statistically inconclusive update assessment in 2012. Initial results of the 2014 assessment were peer reviewed in December 2014 by an international panel of fisheries experts. In January 2015, the final stock assessment, peer review report, and an addendum addressing questions raised by the peer review panel were issued. The peer reviewers approved the stock assessment, while the addendum reported results of additional tests and a change to one of the model parameters requested by the review panel.\nThe ASMFC final benchmark 2014 stock assessment found that the Atlantic menhaden stock was not overfished and that overfishing for Atlantic menhaden was not occurring.\nThe ASMFC reviewed and accepted the 2014 stock assessment for management use in February 2015. The Company expects that the ASMFC Menhaden Board will consider establishing a new coast-wide quota for Atlantic menhaden in the upcoming 2015 fishing season and future seasons based on these recommendations at its scheduled May 2015 meeting. As a result of the factors described above, the Company expects that it should be able to continue to harvest, at a minimum, 130,000 mt in Virginia in 2015.\nThe issue of allocation of the menhaden quota among the Atlantic states is a matter that may be reviewed by the ASMFC later in 2015. Some Atlantic states with relatively low allocations of menhaden have argued that Virginia\u2019s 85+% share of the Atlantic menhaden quota is too high. The current allocation was based on recent historical landings data, which is a common means by which the ASMFC allocates fishing privileges among its member states. It is possible that if changes to the quota level are made, such changes may be distributed by the ASMFC in a manner that results in a lower percentage increase to Virginia and/or the Company. If this occurred, and depending on the magnitude of the reduction, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial results or results of operations.\nAt this time, while the Company anticipates the final ASMFC benchmark 2014 stock assessment will not have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition or results of operation, the Company recognizes there are many variables and unknowns regarding the stock assessment at this time. Therefore, it is possible that the new stock assessment could form a basis for regulatory action that could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition of Bioriginal Food & Science Corp., which closed in September 2014, was a significant acquisition that could pose integration challenges or otherwise adversely impact our business and operating results. A primary component of our growth strategy in the human nutrition segment has been to acquire complementary businesses that expand our customer base and provide access to new markets and increased benefits of scale. For example, we acquired the businesses of Cyvex in 2010, InCon in 2012, WSP in 2013 and most recently, Bioriginal, in September 2014. Acquisitions involve certain known and unknown risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ from our expectations. The Bioriginal acquisition involved the acquisition of a company headquartered in Canada, which may inherently pose more risks than a domestic acquisition. It is possible that the integration of Bioriginal into the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment may divert management\u2019s attention away from our existing animal nutrition business or human nutrition business, resulting in the loss of key customers or employees, or expose us to unanticipated problems or legal liabilities, including responsibility as a successor for undisclosed or contingent liabilities of Bioriginal.\nOur inability to successfully integrate Bioriginal could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of that acquisition and could adversely affect our other business operations and financial results. The integration process may disrupt our business and may preclude the realization of the full benefits expected by us.\nSome of the difficulties in integrating the Bioriginal acquisition may include, among other things:\n\u25cf\nissues in integrating Bioriginal\u2019s products or customers with ours;\n\u25cf\nincompatibility of marketing and administration methods;\n\u25cf\nmaintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u25cf\nintegrating the cultures of both companies;\n\u25cf\npreserving important strategic customer relationships;\n\u25cf\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and information systems;\n\u25cf\ncoordinating and integrating geographically separate organizations located in different countries;\n\u25cf\nan inability to secure, on acceptable terms, sufficient financing that may be required in connection with expanded operations and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf\nmaintaining compliance with U.S., Canadian and EU regulations for food processing facilities and products.\nThe occurrence of any of the above difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.\nThe costs of energy may materially impact Omega Protein\u2019s business. Omega Protein has occasionally experienced substantially higher costs for energy. Omega Protein\u2019s business is materially dependent on diesel fuel for its vessels and natural gas, propane and potentially Bunker C fuel oil for its operating facilities. The costs of these commodities, which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, may have an adverse material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nFluctuation in the \u201ctotal yield\u201d derived from Omega Protein\u2019s fish catch could impact the Company\u2019s ability to operate profitably. The \u201ctotal yield,\u201d or the percentage of fish meal, fish oil and fish solubles products derived from the menhaden fish has fluctuated over the years and from month to month due to natural conditions relating to fish biology over which Omega Protein has no control. The Company believes that fish yields are influenced by multiple factors, including but not limited to, fish diet, weather, water temperature, fish population and age of fish, but such possible relationships and inter-relationships are not generally well understood.\nLaws or regulations regarding fish oil or meal importation into foreign jurisdictions may increase Omega Protein\u2019s costs or cause Omega Protein to lose market share or eliminate certain countries all together. Laws and regulations regarding the importation of fish meal or fish oil into foreign countries, particularly in countries such as China whose regulatory regimes may still be evolving, or in supra-national jurisdictions such as the European Union, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. More stringent laws and regulations, or new interpretations of, or changes to, those laws and regulations, in foreign jurisdictions on contaminant levels, health and sanitation requirements, import documentation, license requirement restrictions imposed by port of entry protocols or other similar restrictions could result in: (i) Omega Protein\u2019s incurrence of additional capital expenditures and operating costs in order to comply with these requirements, (ii) Omega Protein\u2019s withdrawal from marketing its products in those jurisdictions which could lead to material loss of revenues, earnings and market share, or (iii) costs of demurrage, cure or product recall incurred by Omega Protein as it complies with, or attempts to comply with, these restrictions. For example, exports of fish meal to China and the European Union are subject to certain health and sanitation requirements that are administered by the Seafood Inspection Program (\u201cSIP\u201d), a U.S. federal agency selected by these jurisdictions as the competent authority to oversee compliance with export requirements by U.S. based manufacturers. Pursuant to SIP\u2019s interpretation and application of China\u2019s and the European Union\u2019s health and sanitation requirements, several domestic and foreign facilities, including Omega Protein\u2019s processing facilities and its St. Louis fish meal warehouse, may from time to time be limited or restricted in their ability to obtain export certificates in support of shipments of fish meal to China or the European Union or certain shipments by the Company may be reprocessed in order to meet these requirements. In addition, certain foreign countries impose health and sanitation testing requirements for fish meal and fish oil exports that require pre-shipment testing of lots. These testing requirements may hinder particular lots from being approved for export to those countries. These limitations and restrictions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation. If a greater portion of the Company\u2019s sales are derived internationally, or become more concentrated in certain countries or jurisdictions such as China or the European Union, the potential impact of this risk is likely to become larger.\nLaws or regulations that restrict or prohibit menhaden or purse seine fishing operations, or the manufacture, sale or distribution of menhaden products, could adversely affect Omega Protein\u2019s ability to operate. The adoption of new laws or regulations at federal, regional, state or local levels that restrict or prohibit menhaden or purse seine fishing operations, or the manufacture, sale or distribution of menhaden products, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations, could materially adversely affect Omega Protein\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the impact of a violation by Omega Protein of federal, regional, state or local law or regulation relating to its fishing operations, the protection of the environment or the health and safety of its employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nThe Company is also subject to the introduction of legislation from time to time that seeks to ban its operations in their entirety or restrict the sale of its products. For example, in 2007, two bills in the U.S. House of Representatives were introduced and in 2009, a bill in the U.S. Senate was introduced, each of which would have banned menhaden fishing on the Atlantic coast. In the Virginia legislature, an Assembly bill was introduced in 2011 that would have provided for a phased-in moratorium on menhaden fishing in Virginia waters. A 2011 Maryland House bill would have prohibited the manufacture, sale or distribution in Maryland of products obtained from reduction of Atlantic menhaden. While none of these bills ever made any substantial headway in their respective legislative bodies, they are indicative of the challenging legislative and regulatory environment in which the Company operates and to which the Company must devote substantial resources.\nThe enactment of any restrictions similar to those described in the above bills could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWorldwide supply and demand relationships, which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, influence the prices that the Company receives for many of its products and may from time to time result in low prices for many of the Company\u2019s products. Prices for many of the Company\u2019s products are subject to, or influenced by, worldwide and local supply and demand relationships over which the Company has no control and which tend to fluctuate to a significant extent over the course of a year and from year to year. The factors that influence these supply and demand relationships on the Company\u2019s marine based products include world supplies of fish meal made from other fish species, animal proteins and fats, palm oil, rapeseed oil, soy meal and oil, and other edible oils. The factors that influence the supply and demand relationship for the Company\u2019s dairy-based products include global dairy ingredient prices, regional milk supply, regional cheese demand, regional raw whey demand and supply of alternative proteins made from other agricultural sources such as soy, rice and vegetable.\nNew laws or regulations regarding contaminants in fish oil or fish meal may increase Omega Protein\u2019s cost of production or cause Omega Protein to lose business. It is possible that future enactment of increasingly stringent regulations regarding contaminants in fish meal or fish oil by foreign countries or the United States may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. More stringent regulations could result in: (i) Omega Protein\u2019s incurrence of additional capital expenditures on contaminant reduction technology in order to meet the requirements of those jurisdictions, and possibly higher production costs for Omega Protein\u2019s products, or (ii) Omega Protein\u2019s withdrawal from marketing its products in those jurisdictions.\nOmega Protein\u2019s fish catch may be impacted by restrictions on its spotter aircraft. If Omega Protein\u2019s spotter aircraft are prohibited or restricted from operating in their normal manner during the Omega Protein\u2019s fishing season, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. For example, as a direct result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Secretary of Transportation issued a federal ground stop order that grounded certain aircraft (including Omega Protein\u2019s fish-spotting aircraft) for approximately nine days. This loss of spotter aircraft coverage severely hampered Omega Protein\u2019s ability to locate menhaden fish during this nine-day period and thereby reduced its amount of saleable product.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance coverage may not be sufficient, and insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company maintains insurance against physical loss and damage to its assets and coverage against third party liability it may incur in the course of its operations, as well as workers\u2019 compensation, United States Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and Jones Act coverage. The Company\u2019s liability coverage program is generally comprised of several excess liability policies, which are subject to deductibles, underlying limits, annual aggregates and exclusions. The Company believes its insurance coverage to be in such form, against such risks, for such amounts and subject to such deductibles and self-retentions as are generally prudent for its operations but the securing of such coverage by necessity requires judgment in the balancing of retained risk and the cost effectiveness of such insurance programs. In recent years, for example, the Company has elected to increase its deductibles and self-retentions in order to manage rising insurance premium costs. These higher deductibles and self-retentions have resulted in greater uninsured losses to the Company in the cases of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike and will expose the Company to greater risk of loss if additional future claims occur.\nInsurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on what the Company considers to be commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, any insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or damage to, any of the Company\u2019s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, property insurance coverage for flood damages caused by named storm hurricanes has in the past been limited in its availability, and it is possible that such limited coverage might not be adequate to reimburse the Company for its losses if these types of flood losses occur. In addition, should a Company insurer become insolvent, the Company would be responsible for payment of all outstanding claims associated with that insurer\u2019s policies.\nIn addition, insurance coverage is not generally available for punitive damages, and some courts have been increasingly permissive regarding the imposition of punitive damages for Jones Act cases in recent years. For example, in 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court held that punitive damages were permissible in Jones Act \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d claims. If material uninsured punitive damages were to be assessed against the Company pursuant to a Jones Act claim or otherwise, this assessment could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s estimated reserves for claims may not be sufficient. Omega Protein carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and Jones Act liabilities for employees aboard its vessels. Omega Protein records gross insurance reserves by using an estimation process that considers Company-specific and industry information as well as management\u2019s experience, assumptions and consultation with counsel. These reserves include estimated settlement costs. In addition, insurance receivables are recorded for those portions of the claims in excess of Company insurance policy annual aggregate deductibles and stop losses. Management\u2019s current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss. For those claims where there may be a range of loss, Omega Protein has recorded an estimated liability inside that range, based on management\u2019s experience, assumptions and consultation with counsel. The process of estimating and establishing reserves for these claims is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate net cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. There is some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with these claims due to the extended period of time that transpires between when a claim occurs and the full settlement of the claim. This variability is generally greater for Jones Act claims by vessel employees.\nOmega Protein evaluates loss estimates associated with claims and losses as additional information becomes available and revises its estimates. Although management believes estimated reserves related to these claims are adequately recorded, it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded reserves, which could materially impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOther sources of Long Chain Omega-3 fatty acids may be discovered or created and might compete with our menhaden-based products. It is possible that other sources of omega-3 fatty acids derived from other sources such as animals, plants, algae, bacteria, genetically modified organisms or synthetic sources might be discovered or created and these sources might compete with menhaden-based products. Some of the research projects attempting to discover or develop these new sources of omega-3 products may be funded by companies with greater resources than the Company. If such products are developed and became commercially available to the point where the Company\u2019s menhaden product sales are adversely impacted, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nA proposed National Ocean Policy Plan could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation. In June 2009, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum creating an Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force charged with, among other things, creating a unitary National Ocean Policy for the United States. In July 2010, the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force issued its Final Recommendations for a new policy and administrative structure to comprehensively assess, evaluate, and manage activities and uses impacting the nation\u2019s oceans, coasts and Great Lakes. That same day, President Obama issued Executive Order 13547, creating the National Ocean Council (\u201cNOC\u201d), a body comprised of cabinet secretaries, agency heads and other senior members of the federal government.\nIn January 2012, the NOC issued a Draft National Ocean Policy Plan (\u201cNOPP\u201d) for public comment. In general, the NOPP outlines a detailed system of federal-state cooperation in managing all aspects of ocean policy, including, most relevantly, marine transportation and fisheries. If implemented, the NOPP would create eight regional councils with federal, state and tribal representatives that will draft comprehensive regional management plans that will be implemented by federal and state agencies pursuant to their governing legal authorities. Such \u201ccoastal and marine spatial plans\u201d are to be guided by, among other things, the concept of \u201cecosystem-based management,\u201d which the NOPP defines as \u201can integrated approach to resource management that considers the entire ecosystem, including humans.\u201d\nIn May 2014, the Mid-Atlantic Regional Planning Body (\u201cRPB\u201d), formed pursuant to the NOP and Executive Order 13547 issued its \u201cMid-Atlantic Regional Ocean Planning Framework\u201d (\u201cFramework\u201d). The Framework does not identify any specific goals or objectives that directly seek to manage coastal fisheries. The Framework is not expected to have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations in 2014 or in the immediate future.\nIn October 2014, the RPB released a Draft Ocean Action Plan (\u201cDraft Action Plan\u201d) and initial outline of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Ocean Assessment (\u201cROA\u201d) for public comment. The ROA is intended to serve as an overarching environmental assessment document intended to support the Action Plan. The ROA has been presented only in outline form, organized by major goals and objectives identified in the Framework. Under the objective of \u201cHealthy Ocean Ecosystem\u201d and its associated topics of \u201cEcosystem Based Management,\u201d \u201cEcosystem Changes in Mid-Atlantic,\u201d and \u201cEcosystem Services,\u201d the ROA proposes to include a discussion of Atlantic menhaden, along with six other species of vertebrate fish. Development of ROA is expected to occur over a period of several years and will not, in and of itself, result in any actions being taken or prohibited. However, depending on the quality and level of analysis regarding Atlantic menhaden, such as analysis could be used to support future actions taken under the Action Plan that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Gulf of Mexico Alliance (\u201cGMA\u201d), formed in 2004, serves as the regional planning body under the NOP for the Gulf of Mexico. The GMA adopted its first action plan in 2006, which contained broad objectives, such as identifying Gulf habitats, environmental education, wetland restoration, and water quality. GMA\u2019s second action plan, covering 2009-2014, continued this focus and added collection of ecosystem data to support fisheries management and to support ecosystem-based management initiatives as an action item. The GMA\u2019s third action plan is being developed and expected to be finalized in the fall of 2015. The GMA has indicated that it will include a focus on \u201cecosystem services,\u201d which may include a focus on fisheries and fish stocks such as menhaden. To date, the GMA has generally focused on data collection and high level objectives implemented over a period of years. Therefore, the Company believes that the GMA\u2019s third action plan is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation, although it is possible that it could do so if the plan were to substantially regulate the menhaden fishery in a materially adverse manner.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s products could cause fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results and could have a material adverse effect on its reputation, the demand for its products, and its ability to generate revenues. The Company is dependent upon consumer perception of the safety and quality of Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Consumer perception of products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention, and other publicity about product use. A product may be received favorably, resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s industries or any of their particular products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s products or any other similar products with illness or other adverse effects, that questions the benefits of Nutegrity or Bioriginal products or similar products, or that claims that such products are ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the demand for Nutegrity or Bioriginal products, and our ability to generate revenues.\nCompliance with new and existing governmental regulations could increase the Company\u2019s costs significantly, reduce our growth prospects and adversely affect Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s results of operations. The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, FTC, CPSC, OSHA, EPA, Health Canada, CFIA and EFSA. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, or require the discontinuance of Nutegrity and Bioriginal products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, manufacture, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that Nutegrity or Bioriginal may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, or may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that the Company uses to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, the claim is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a \u201chealth claim.\u201d Any of these actions could prevent Nutegrity or Bioriginal from marketing particular dietary supplement ingredients in the United States or making certain claims or statements for those products. The FDA could also require Nutegrity or Bioriginal to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to the Company, including lost revenues from any products that Nutegrity or Bioriginal is required to remove from the market. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects.\nAdditional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and food products have been considered from time to time. These regulations could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. We may not be able to comply with such new regulations without incurring additional expenses, which could be significant.\nThe Company may incur material product liability claims and product recall costs, which could increase the Company\u2019s costs and adversely affect its reputation, revenues and operating income. As a manufacturer of products designed for human consumption, the Company is subject to product liability claims and product recall costs if the use of Nutegrity or Bioriginal products are alleged to have resulted in injury. Nutegrity and Bioriginal products contain vitamins, minerals, herbs and other dietary ingredients that are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. Nutegrity and Bioriginal products could unintentionally contain contaminated substances, and some of its products contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. It is possible that previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur.\nIn addition, third-party manufacturers produce many of the products that Nutegrity and Bioriginal sell. As a distributor of products manufactured by third parties, the Company may also be liable for various product liability claims for products that Nutegrity and Bioriginal does not manufacture. Although Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s purchase agreements with their third-party vendors typically require the vendor to indemnify Nutegrity and Bioriginal to the extent of any such claims, any such indemnification is limited by its terms. Moreover, as a practical matter, any such indemnification is dependent on the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and its insurer, and the absence of significant defenses by the insurers. We may be unable to obtain full recovery from the insurer or any indemnifying third party in respect of any claims against us in connection with products manufactured by such third party.\nIncrease in the price and shortage of supply of key raw materials could adversely affect Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s business. Certain of Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s products are composed of key raw materials that are purchased from third parties. Nutegrity and Bioriginal purchase their botanical raw materials from manufacturers and distributors in Asia, Europe, and North America. In addition, Nutegrity manufactures all of its dairy protein products from dairy ingredient raw materials that it purchases from local cheese makers and dairy farmers and is completely dependent on these local sources of supply. For example, three of Nutegrity\u2019s dairy ingredient raw material suppliers accounted for approximately 63% of its dairy ingredient raw material supply for the year ended December 31, 2014. Dairy ingredient raw material purchase arrangements are typically short-term supply contracts or spot sales agreements. Bioriginal manufactures a substantial volume of products that are dependent on coconut raw materials as a source of supply and Bioriginal imports these coconut raw materials from foreign countries such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka. These areas are susceptible to hurricanes and political instability and these factors may make these sources of supply unavailable from time to time, or available at prices that are not attractive to Bioriginal.\nRaw material prices may increase in the future and Nutegrity and Bioriginal may not be able to pass on such increases to its customers. A significant increase in the price of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on Nutegrity\u2019s and Bioriginal\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if Nutegrity and Bioriginal cannot get access to key raw materials due to (i) increased regulatory scrutiny or changing regulatory standards involving dietary supplements or their ingredients or the importation of these raw materials into the United States or Canada, or (ii) lack of supply, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nReal or perceived quality control problems with raw materials outsourced from certain regions could negatively impact consumer confidence in Nutegrity or Bioriginal products, or expose us to liability. In addition, although some raw materials may be available from other sources, an unexpected interruption of supply or material increases in the price of raw materials, for any reason, such as changes in economic and political conditions, tariffs, trade disputes, regulatory requirements, import restrictions, loss of certifications, acts of God or other events, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Also, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar or Euro could result in higher costs for raw materials purchased in other countries.\nThe Company\u2019s dealings in foreign countries require the Company to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions in which the Company does business. Doing business in foreign markets requires the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and the Company\u2019s failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose it to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act (\u201cUKBA\u201d). The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires us to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect our transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA and UKBA. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. The Company has established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which the Company may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operation and financial condition.\nComplying with recently enacted healthcare reform legislation could increase the Company\u2019s costs and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The healthcare reform legislation enacted in 2010 could significantly increase the Company\u2019s costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition by requiring the Company either to provide certain kinds of mandated health insurance coverage to its employees or to pay certain penalties for electing not to provide such coverage. Because these new requirements are broad, complex, subject to certain phase-in rules and may be challenged by legal actions in the coming months and years, it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact that this legislation will have on the Company\u2019s business and operating costs. This legislation or any alternative version that may ultimately be implemented may materially increase the Company\u2019s operating costs. This legislation could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s employee relations and ability to compete for new employees if its response to this legislation is considered less favorable than the responses or health benefits offered by employers with whom the Company competes for talent.\nThe inability to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the Company may not be able to determine the extent of unauthorized use of its trademarks and patents. Such efforts are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that infringing goods could not be manufactured without our knowledge and consent. Many of the Company\u2019s products are not subject to patent protection, and therefore they can be legally reverse-engineered by competitors. From time to time the Company faces opposition to our applications to register trademarks, and the Company may not ultimately be successful in its attempts to register certain trademarks.\nClimate changes may affect Omega Protein\u2019s business. According to certain scientific studies, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases commonly known as greenhouse gases may be contributing to global warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and to global climate change, which may exacerbate the severity of these conditions. It is also possible that these conditions, if they occur, would impact the spawning, feeding, migration, distribution and growth of the menhaden species and hence, our fishing harvest. As a result, such conditions may pose increased climate-related risks to our assets and operations.\nDue to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of, and other risks associated with, climate issues, the Company cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on its business.\nThird party labor strikes and supply chain interruptions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to import certain raw materials. Certain of the Company\u2019s products are composed of raw materials that are imported from foreign manufacturers and distributors. Nutegrity frequently imports these raw materials using containerized cargo ships through the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. Since May 2014, contentious labor negotiations between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents terminal operators, have slowed operations at West Coast ports. These slowed operations have in some cases resulted in shipment delivery delays, increased use of air cargo, and rerouting containerized cargo shipments through other ports. These factors, if they were to continue for a sufficient length of time, could result in higher costs for raw materials purchased abroad and delivery delays to customers.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Operations:\nThe Company\u2019s strategy to become a fully integrated nutritional ingredient company is subject to inherent risk. The Company\u2019s strategy to become a fully integrated nutritional ingredient company and to expand the sales of its fish oil products into the markets for refined, functional foods and supplement grade fish oils for human consumption is subject to risks inherent in any business expansion. The Company\u2019s expectations regarding future demand for nutritional products may prove to be incorrect or, if future demand does meet the Company\u2019s expectations, it is possible that purchasers could utilize nutritional products other than the Company\u2019s products. In addition, the Company is now operating in areas subject to different regulations and subject to different market forces than its historical commercial fishing business, all of which makes the Company\u2019s overall business environment more complex and challenging.\nOur implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could result in problems that could negatively impact our business. We began implementing a new ERP system in 2014 that will support substantially all of our operating and financial functions and are continuing to implement this system in 2015. While no problems have been experienced with this implementation to date, it is possible that we could experience problems in connection with this implementation, including compatibility issues, training requirements, higher than expected implementation costs and other integration challenges and delays, as our employees learn the new system, transfer data from our existing system to the new system and operate with the new system. Any difficulties that we encounter in implementing the new system may disrupt our operations and our ability to deal effectively with our employees, vendors, customers and other companies with which we have commercial relationships. Additionally, a significant problem with the implementation, integration with other systems or ongoing management of an ERP system and related systems could have an adverse effect on our ability to generate and interpret accurate management and financial reports and other information on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting system and internal controls and adversely affect our ability to manage our business or comply with various regulations.\nThe Company has a moderate amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect its ability to operate its business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on its debt. The Company utilized a portion of its cash on hand and borrowings under its bank credit facility to complete the acquisition of Bioriginal. As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness under its bank credit facility, its loan agreements under the Title XI Fisheries Finance Program and the indebtedness of Bioriginal assumed in the acquisition, was approximately $35.2 million. The Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s ability to meet its expenses and debt obligations will depend on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. The Company will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. The Company cannot be certain that its earnings will be sufficient to allow it to pay the principal and interest on its existing or future debt and meet its other obligations. If the Company does not have enough money to service its existing or future debt, it may be required to refinance all or part of its existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. The Company may not be able to refinance its existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to it, if at all;\n\u25cf\nit may be more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations with respect to the bank credit facility, its loan agreements under the Title XI Fisheries Finance Program, and its assumed Bioriginal indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of the agreements governing such indebtedness, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under such agreements;\n\u25cf\nthe covenants contained in the Company\u2019s debt agreements limit its ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet its operating expenses or other general corporate obligations;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of the Company\u2019s interest expense may increase because certain of its borrowings are, and any future borrowings under its bank credit facility and Bioriginal\u2019s assumed indebtedness would be, at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense;\n\u25cf\nthe Company will need to use a portion of its cash flows to pay principal and interest on its debt, which will reduce the amount of money the Company has for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;\n\u25cf\nthe Company may have a higher level of debt than some of its competitors, which could put it at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u25cf\nthe Company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its industry or the economy in general; and\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s debt level could limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results will fluctuate as its business is seasonal in nature and subject to estimates. Omega Protein\u2019s menhaden harvesting and processing business is seasonal in nature. Omega Protein generally has higher sales during the menhaden harvesting season (which includes the second and third quarter of each fiscal year) due to increased product availability and customer demand. Additionally, due to differences in gross profit margins for Omega Protein\u2019s various products, any variation in the mix of product sales between quarters may result in significant variations of total gross profit margins. Similarly, from time to time Omega Protein defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products that affect prices for its products, which may affect comparable period comparisons. As a result, the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future.\nIn addition, inventory is generally carried over from one year to the next year, and Omega Protein generally begins selling its current season\u2019s production late in the second quarter and sells that production until the second quarter of the following year. Costs can change meaningfully from one season to the next.\nFurther, Omega Protein\u2019s per unit cost of production is estimated prior to the beginning of each fishing season based on total estimated fishing costs (including off-season costs) divided by estimated total units of production. Omega Protein adjusts the cost of sales, unallocated inventory cost pool and inventory balances at the end of the second, third and fourth quarters based on revised estimates of total units of production to total inventoriable costs. Changes in estimates from one quarter to the next can have a significant impact on operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to significant competition, and some competitors have significantly greater financial resources and more extensive and diversified operations than the Company. The marine protein and oil business is subject to significant competition from producers of vegetable and other animal protein products and oil products such as Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill. In addition, Omega Protein competes with a smaller domestic privately-owned menhaden fishing company and with numerous fish processors outside the United States. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources, less onerous regulatory costs and more extensive and diversified operations than the Company.\nThe U.S. dietary supplement ingredient supplier industry is a large, highly fragmented and growing industry, with no single industry participant accounting for a majority of total industry sales. Competition is based primarily on price, quality and assortment of products, customer service, marketing support and availability of new ingredients. In addition, the market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products. Nutegrity and Bioriginal compete with manufacturers, distributors and marketers of dietary supplement ingredients both within and outside the United States.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign customers are subject to disruption typical to foreign countries. The Company\u2019s sales of its products in foreign countries are subject to risks associated with foreign countries such as changes in social, political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u25cf\nChanges in the law and policies that govern foreign investment and international trade in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nChanges in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign investment and trade;\n\u25cf\nChanges in tax or other laws;\n\u25cf\nPartial or total expropriation;\n\u25cf\nCurrent exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nRestrictions on current repatriation; or\n\u25cf\nPolitical disturbances, insurrection or war.\nIn addition, it is possible that the Company, at any one time, could have a significant amount of its revenues generated by sales in a particular country which would concentrate the Company\u2019s susceptibility to adverse events in that country. For example, in 2014, approximately 12% of the Company\u2019s revenues were derived from customers in China.\nThe Company may undertake acquisitions that are unsuccessful and the Company\u2019s inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring businesses could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. In the future the Company may undertake acquisitions of other businesses, located either in the United States or in other countries, although there can be no assurances that this will occur. The Company had not made any acquisitions until its acquisitions of Cyvex in December 2010, InCon in September 2011, WSP in February 2013 and Bioriginal in September 2014. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able (i) to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms, (ii) to profitably manage recent acquisitions, or future businesses it may acquire, or (iii) to successfully integrate recent acquisitions or future businesses it may acquire without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the purchase price paid in an acquisition is assigned to the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. To the extent indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized, such as goodwill, the fair value of those assets is tested for impairment at least annually.\nThese estimates of fair value are based upon a number of factors and assumptions, many of which are inherently uncertain, unpredictable and subjective. Unanticipated events and circumstances may, and often do, occur which affect the accuracy or validity of management\u2019s prior assumptions and estimates and could result in subsequent fair value estimates that trigger impairments of intangible or other assets in the financial statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company recognized a write-down of $4.7 million for goodwill and other intangible assets associated with InCon and Cyvex.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with federal U.S. citizenship ownership requirements may prevent it from harvesting menhaden in the U.S. jurisdictional waters. Omega Protein\u2019s harvesting operations are subject to the Shipping Act of 1916 and the regulations promulgated there under by the Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration which require, among other things, that the Company be incorporated under the laws of the U.S. or a state, the Company\u2019s chief executive officer be a U.S. citizen, no more of the Company\u2019s directors be non-citizens than a minority of a number necessary to constitute a quorum and at least 75% of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock (including a majority of its voting capital stock) be owned by U.S. citizens. If the Company fails to observe any of these requirements, the Company will not be eligible to conduct its harvesting activities in U.S. jurisdictional waters which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOmega Protein may not be able to recruit, train and retain qualified marine personnel in sufficient numbers. Omega Protein\u2019s business is dependent on its ability to recruit, train and retain qualified marine personnel in sufficient numbers such as vessel captains, vessel engineers and other crewmembers. Omega Protein has experienced difficulty from time to time, depending on labor markets, in recruiting its optimal number of employees. To the extent that Omega Protein is not successful in recruiting, training and retaining employees in sufficient numbers, its productivity may suffer. If Omega Protein were unable to secure a sufficient number of workers during periods of peak employment, the lack of personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOmega Protein may lose access in 2015 to the H2B Visa Program which we rely on for qualified marine personnel. Omega Protein had historically utilized workers in the United States H2B Visa Program whereby foreign nationals are permitted to enter the United States temporarily and engage in seasonal, non-agricultural employment. On March 4, 2015, the federal district court in the Northern District of Florida vacated the Department of Labor\u2018s 2008 H-2B regulations on the ground that the Department of Labor lacks authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to issue regulations for the H-2B program. Because of this decision, the Department of Labor has announced that it can no longer accept or process requests for prevailing wage determinations or applications for labor certification in the H-2B program and that it was considering its options in light of the court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, the Company believes that the program\u2019s future is now uncertain. If Omega Protein cannot participate in the H2B Visa Program in 2015, or its participation in that program is delayed, then its ability to secure a sufficient number of qualified workers during periods of peak employment may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s bank credit facility and other Fisheries Finance Program loan agreements contain covenants and restrictions that may limit the Company\u2019s financial flexibility. The Company\u2019s loan agreements under the Title XI Fisheries Finance Program contain various covenants and restrictions. The bank credit facility and Bioriginal indebtedness also contains various financial covenants with which the Company must comply.\nInvestment Risks. Investment risks specifically related to the Company\u2019s common stock include:\nUncertain economic conditions may have material adverse impacts on our business, results of operation and financial condition that we currently cannot predict. As widely reported, economic conditions in the United States and globally drastically deteriorated during 2008 and 2009. Financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by extreme volatility and declines in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, inability to access capital markets, the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions, European sovereign debt issues and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government and other governments. Although many of these factors have changed by varying degrees during the following years, we cannot predict whether future similar events will occur or will materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nFor example, it is possible that in the future:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to obtain modifications to the financial covenants under the bank credit facility and assumed Bioriginal indebtedness, if necessary, on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nthe demand for fishmeal and oil may decline due to the uncertain economic conditions which could negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our business;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to obtain adequate funding under the bank credit facility and assumed Bioriginal indebtedness or future credit agreements due to lending counterparties being unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations;\n\u25cf\nthe tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables;\n\u25cf\nour ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital for our business including for capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the value of plan assets for our defined benefit plan may result in increased benefit costs and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of required future contributions; or\n\u25cf\nour commodity hedging arrangements could become ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection.\nThe limited liquidity for the Company\u2019s common stock could affect your ability to sell your shares at a satisfactory price. The Company\u2019s common stock is relatively illiquid. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately 21.5 million shares of common stock outstanding. The average daily trading volume in the common stock during the prior 60 calendar days ending on that date was approximately 342,000 shares. A more active public market for the Company\u2019s common stock, however, may not develop, which would continue to adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the common stock. Moreover, a thin trading market for the common stock causes the market price for the common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, the Company\u2019s common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of the common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, you may be unable to liquidate your investment in the Company at a satisfactory price.\nIssuance of shares in connection with financing transactions or under stock incentive plans will dilute current stockholders. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s stock incentive plans, the Company\u2019s management is authorized to grant stock awards to its employees, directors and consultants. Stockholders will incur dilution upon exercise of any outstanding stock awards. In addition, if the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock, further dilution to its existing stockholders will result, and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect the market price of its stock. The Company had outstanding options to purchase approximately 1.3 million shares of its common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $7.39 per share as of December 31, 2014. These shares of common stock are registered for resale on currently effective registration statements. Certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors have from time to time in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, Rule 10b5-1 sales plans with brokers unaffiliated with the Company whereby they commit to sell automatically and without discretion a predetermined number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock over a period of time according to their own individual criteria. The issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, or the availability for sale, or sale, of a substantial number of the shares of common stock eligible for future sale under effective registration statements, Rule 10b5-1 plans, under Rule 144 or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nUnder the Company\u2019s securities trading policy, Rule 10b5-1 stock sales or purchase plans are required to be approved by the Company for directors, officers and certain key employees. The Company expects that public disclosure regarding purchases or sales under these Rule 10b5-1 plans will be provided through Form 4 and Rule 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not intend to disclose further information regarding the existence or terms of these trading plans for individual participants.\nThe Company has not paid dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock since it became a public company in April 1998 and has no intention to do so in the near future. Any determination as to payment of dividends will be made at the discretion of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and will depend upon the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions and such other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as Nevada and federal law, could delay or prevent corporate takeovers and could prevent stockholders from realizing a premium on their investment. Certain provisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as well as the Nevada Corporation Law, could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving the Company, even if such events could be viewed as beneficial by its stockholders. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors is empowered to issue preferred stock or rights in one or more series without stockholder action. Any issuance of this blank-check preferred stock could materially limit the rights of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock and render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. In addition, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain a number of provisions which could impede a takeover or change in control of the Company, including, among other things, staggered terms for members of its Board of Directors, the requiring of two-thirds vote of stockholders to amend certain provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or the inability to take action by written consent or to call special stockholder meetings. Certain provisions of the Nevada Corporation Law could also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. In addition, federal law requires that at least 75% of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock be owned by U.S. citizens which could discourage takeover attempts by potential foreign purchasers.", "PERMNO": 85951, "SIC": 2070, "TIC": "OME"}
