{"cik": "7431", "company": "ARMSTRONG WORLD INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nSales fluctuations to and changes in our relationships with key customers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe loss, reduction, or fluctuation of sales to key customers, including independent distributors or national home center customers, or any adverse change in our business relationship with them, whether as a result of changing customer demands and expectations, reduced customer demand, supply chain constraints, competition, industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIf the availability of our manufacturing inputs or sourced products decreases, or the cost of those inputs or sourced products increases, and we are unable to pass along increased costs resulting from supply chain or inflationary pressures, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe availability and cost of raw materials, packaging materials, energy and sourced products are critical to our operations and our results of operations. For example, we use substantial quantities of natural gas and some petroleum-based raw materials in our manufacturing operations. The cost of some of these inputs has been volatile in recent years and availability has been limited at times. We source some materials from a limited number of suppliers, which, among other things, increases the risk of unavailability. Limited availability could require us to reformulate products or limit our production. Supply chain disruptions could decrease access to manufacturing inputs or sourced products or significantly increase the cost to purchase these items. A decrease in availability or increases in costs of manufacturing inputs or sourced products, and any inability to pass along such costs through price increases, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe performance of our WAVE joint venture is important to our financial results. Changes in the demand for, or quality of, WAVE products, or in the operational or financial performance of the WAVE joint venture, could have an adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Similarly, if there is a change with respect to our joint venture partner that adversely impacts its relationship with us, WAVE\u2019s performance could be adversely impacted.\nOur equity investment in our WAVE joint venture remains important to our financial results. WAVE\u2019s markets are highly competitive and changes in the demand for, or quality of, WAVE products, or in the operational or financial performance of the WAVE joint venture, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Similarly, the availability and cost of raw materials, packaging materials, energy and sourced products, and the ability to pass along increased costs, are critical to WAVE\u2019s operations and its results of operations.\nWe believe the relationship with our partner, Worthington Industries, Inc., is an important element in the success of this joint venture. If there is a change in ownership, a change of control, a change in management or management philosophy, a change in business strategy or another event with respect to our partner that adversely impacts our relationship, WAVE\u2019s performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, our partner may develop economic or business interests or goals that are different from or inconsistent with our interests or goals, which may impact our ability to influence or align WAVE\u2019s strategy and operations with our interests or goals.\nIncreased costs of labor, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity, and increased labor shortages, could delay or impede production and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIncreased costs of labor, including the costs of employee benefits plans, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity, and increased labor shortages, could delay or impede production and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. As the majority of our manufacturing employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements, we often incur costs attributable to periodic renegotiation of those agreements, which may be difficult to project. We are also subject to the risk that strikes or other conflicts with organized personnel may arise or that we may become the subject of union organizing activity at our facilities that do not currently have union representation. Prolonged negotiations, conflicts or related activities could also lead to costly work stoppages and loss of productivity.\nWe continuously pursue productivity initiatives and periodically engage in cost-saving initiatives. Our inability to execute these initiatives may result in lower-than-expected savings in our operating cost structure or may not improve our operating results.\nWe aggressively seek ways to make our operations more efficient and effective. We may reduce, move, modify and expand our plants and operations, as well as our sourcing and supply chain arrangements, and invest in technology, as needed, to control costs and improve productivity. Such actions involve substantial planning, often require capital investments and may result in charges for fixed asset impairments or obsolescence and substantial severance costs. Our ability to achieve cost savings and other benefits within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays resulting from equipment failures or other interruptions in production, or if other unforeseen events occur, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur pursuit of environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") and sustainability objectives, including those related to climate change, may not achieve the anticipated benefits we expect or may not align with new regulations or expectations of stakeholders, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn November 2021, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report, which includes certain ESG and sustainability objectives. In our pursuit of these or other ESG and sustainability objectives, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits we expect or may not align with new regulations or expectations of stakeholders. In addition, we may encounter challenges measuring our progress towards the achievement of those objectives. Finally, increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers and investors on ESG and sustainability issues, including those related to climate change, may result in new or increased regulations and stakeholder demands that could cause us to incur additional costs and make significant investments in or changes to our operations to comply with any such regulations and demands. If we are unable to adequately meet our ESG and sustainability objectives or fail to comply with all laws, regulations and policies, or align with stakeholder demands, it could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nWe may not experience the anticipated benefits from our strategic initiatives, including investments in digitalization, Healthy Spaces and innovation.\nWe continue to evaluate and may pursue strategic initiatives involving the development or utilization of new or innovative products, solutions and tools, including those related to Healthy Spaces, as well as the expansion of our digital capabilities. These initiatives are\ndesigned to grow revenue, improve profitability and increase shareholder value. Our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully identify, execute and integrate these initiatives or if we are unable to complete these initiatives in a timely and efficient manner to realize competitive advantages and opportunities.\nWe may pursue strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or other investments, which could create risks and present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe regularly evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or other investments that we believe could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. Any such strategic transaction involves a number of risks, including potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and business operations and infrastructure, and increasing or decreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. Strategic transactions could involve payment by us of a substantial amount of cash, assumption of liabilities and indemnification obligations, regulatory requirements, incurrence of a substantial amount of debt or issuance of a substantial amount of equity. Certain strategic opportunities may not result in the consummation of a transaction or may fail to realize the intended benefits and synergies. If we fail to identify, consummate and integrate our strategic transactions in a timely and cost-effective manner, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nNegative tax consequences can have an unanticipated effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our operations and results is sometimes open to interpretation. Our income tax expense (benefit) and reported net income (loss) may fluctuate significantly, and may be materially different than forecasted or experienced in the past. Our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in effective tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, the results of examinations of previously filed tax returns, and ongoing assessments of our tax exposures.\nOur financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could also be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We have substantial deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), which are available to reduce our U.S. income tax liability and to offset future state taxable income. However, our ability to utilize the current carrying value of these deferred tax assets may be impacted as a result of certain future events, such as changes in tax legislation and insufficient future taxable income prior to expiration of the capital loss carryforwards and NOLs.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate and invest in our business, execute on our strategic initiatives, and return cash to shareholders.\nOur level of indebtedness and degree of leverage could:\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, more able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from pursuing;\n\u2022limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; and\n\u2022adversely affect our credit ratings, if any.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness, which could exacerbate the risks described above. In addition, to the extent that our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates, our sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations will increase.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe require a significant amount of liquidity to fund our operations, and borrowing has increased our exposure to materially negative unforeseen events.\nOur liquidity needs vary throughout the year. If our business experiences materially negative unforeseen events, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our needs or maintain sufficient liquidity to operate and remain in compliance with our debt covenants, which could result in reduced or delayed planned capital expenditures and other investments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness include covenants that may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022create liens on certain assets to secure debt.\nUnder the terms of our senior secured credit facility, we are required to maintain specified leverage and interest coverage ratios. Our ability to meet these ratios could be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will meet them. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants or ratios would result in a default under the senior secured credit facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility may be able to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings under our facilities, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, or enforce their security interest. The lenders may also have the right in these circumstances to terminate commitments to provide further borrowings.\nSignificant changes in factors and assumptions used to measure our defined benefit plan obligations, actual investment returns on pension assets and other factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nWe maintain significant pension and postretirement plans in the U.S. The recognition of costs and liabilities associated with these plans for financial reporting purposes is affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and the expenses recognized for these plans.\nThe inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using multiple assumptions and represent management\u2019s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on reported results are the discount rate, the estimated long-term return on plan assets for the funded plans, retirement rates, and mortality rates and, for postretirement plans, the estimated inflation in health care costs. These assumptions are generally updated annually.\nIn the aggregate, our U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $71.6 million as of December 31, 2021. Our unfunded U.S. postretirement plan liabilities were $78.0 million as of December 31, 2021. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our pension and postretirement plans obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.\nIf the separation and distribution of Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (\u201cAFI\u201d) fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then AFI, AWI and AWI\u2019s shareholders could be subject to significant tax liability or tax indemnity obligations.\nOn April 1, 2016, we completed our previously announced separation of AFI by allocating the assets and liabilities related primarily to the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments to AFI and then distributing the common stock of AFI to our shareholders at a ratio of one share of AFI common stock for every two shares of AWI common stock. In connection with the distribution, we received an opinion from our special tax counsel, on the basis of certain facts, representations, covenants and assumptions set forth in such opinion, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the separation and distribution should qualify as a transaction that generally is tax-free to us and our shareholders under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nNotwithstanding the tax opinion, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could determine on audit that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or covenants set forth in the tax opinion is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion. If the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend to each U.S. holder of our common shares who receives shares of AFI in connection with the spinoff for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and such shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, we and/or AFI could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations, whether under applicable law or the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with AFI, if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe may be subject to liability under, and may make substantial future expenditures to comply with, environmental laws and regulations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are actively involved in environmental investigation and remediation activities relating to two domestically owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity, for which our ultimate liability may exceed the currently estimated and accrued amounts. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our current environmental matters and the potential liabilities associated therewith. It is also possible that we could become subject to additional environmental matters and corresponding liabilities in the future.\nThe building materials industry has been subject to claims relating to raw materials such as silicates, polychlorinated biphenyl (\u201cPCB\u201d), polyvinyl chloride (\u201cPVC\u201d), formaldehyde, fire-retardants and claims relating to other issues such as mold and toxic fumes, as well as claims for incidents of catastrophic loss, such as building fires. We have not received any significant claims involving our raw materials or our product performance; however, product liability insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances to cover claims that may arise in the future.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future.\nPotential regulatory actions, product and service claims, environmental claims and other litigation could be costly and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. While we strive to ensure that our products and services comply with applicable government regulatory standards and internal requirements, and that our products and services perform effectively and safely, customers from time to time could claim that our products and services do not meet warranty or contractual requirements, and users could claim to be harmed by use or misuse of our products and services. These claims could give rise to breach of contract, warranty or recall claims, or claims for negligence, product liability, strict liability, personal injury or property damage. They could also result in negative publicity.\nIn addition, claims and investigations may arise related to patent infringement, distributor relationships, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law requirements, employment matters, employee benefits issues, and other compliance and regulatory matters, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. While we have processes and policies designed to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we cannot predict or, in some cases, control the costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. In addition, the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant judgment or claim is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products or brands, which could adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe rely on our proprietary intellectual property, including numerous patents and registered trademarks, as well as our licensed intellectual property to market, promote and sell our products. We monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute, or otherwise harm our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property and rely on the patent, trademark and other laws of the U.S. and other countries. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. jurisdictions, particularly those of certain emerging markets, provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the U.S. and present greater risks of counterfeiting and other infringement. To the extent we cannot protect our intellectual property, unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations in Canada and Latin America. Legislative, political, regulatory and economic volatility, as well as vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nA portion of our sales are generated through international trade. These sales are subject to currency exchange fluctuations, trade regulations, import duties, logistics costs, delays and other related risks. Our international operations are also subject to various tax rates, credit risks in emerging markets, political risks, uncertain legal systems, and loss of sales to local competitors following currency devaluations in countries where we import products for sale. In addition, our international growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to expand our operations in Canada and Latin America. However, some emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets. Similarly, our efforts to enhance the profitability or accelerate the growth of our operations in certain markets depends largely on the economic and geopolitical conditions in those local or regional markets.\nIn addition, in many countries outside of the United States, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws, as well as U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties. As we continue to expand our business, we may have difficulty anticipating and effectively managing these and other risks that our operations may face, which may adversely affect our business outside the United States and our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nRisks Related to General Economic and Other Factors\nUnstable market and economic conditions could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur business is influenced by market and economic conditions, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability and cost of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and the effects of government stimulus. Volatility in financial markets and the continued softness or further deterioration of national and global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, including as follows:\n\u2022the financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers;\n\u2022commercial and residential consumers of our products may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or stagnation or further declines in income or asset values, which could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products;\n\u2022the value of investments underlying our defined benefit pension plan may decline, which could result in negative plan investment performance and additional charges which may involve significant cash contributions to the plan in order to meet obligations or regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022our asset impairment assessments and underlying valuation assumptions may change, which could result from changes to estimates of future sales and cash flows that may lead to substantial impairment charges.\nContinued or sustained deterioration of economic conditions would likely exacerbate and prolong these adverse effects.\nOur business is dependent on construction activity in North America. Downturns or delays in construction activity could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur business has greater sales opportunities when construction activity is strong and, conversely, has fewer opportunities when such activity declines. The cyclical nature of commercial and residential construction activity, including construction activity funded by the public sector, tends to be influenced by prevailing economic conditions, including the rate of growth in gross domestic product, prevailing interest rates, government spending patterns, business, investor and consumer confidence, inflation, availability of labor, adequately functioning supply chains and other factors beyond our control. Prolonged downturns or delays in construction activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur markets are highly competitive. Competition could reduce demand for our products or negatively affect our sales mix or price realization. Failure to compete effectively by meeting consumer preferences, developing and marketing innovative solutions, maintaining strong customer service and distribution relationships, and expanding our solutions capabilities and reach could adversely affect our results.\nOur customers consider product performance attributes, product styling, customer service and price when deciding whether to purchase our products. Shifting consumer preference in our highly competitive markets, from acoustical solutions to other ceiling and wall products, for example, whether for performance attributes, such as acoustics and sustainability, and health attributes, or styling preferences or our inability to develop and offer new competitive performance features could have an adverse effect on our sales. Similarly, our ability to identify, protect and market new and innovative solutions is critical to our long-term growth strategy, namely to sell into more spaces and sell more solutions in every space. If our competitors offer discounts on certain products or provide new or alternative offerings that the marketplace perceives as more cost-effective, it could adversely affect our price realization. Any broad-based change to our price realization could materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nCustomer consolidation, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, and our potential failure to attract new customers in our markets, may negatively impact our operating margins and profitability.\nA number of our customers, including distributors and contractors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue. Further consolidation could impact margin growth and profitability as larger customers may realize certain operational and other benefits of scale. The economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, and our customers' responses to those changes could impact our business. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operating and information systems may experience a failure, a compromise of security, or a violation of data privacy laws or regulations, which could interrupt or damage our operations.\nIn the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems, which are vulnerable to disruption and an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. These information systems may be disrupted or fail as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including events such as natural disasters and extreme weather, power loss, software or hardware defects, or hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyber-attacks. All of these risks are also applicable where we rely on outside vendors to provide services, which may operate in a cloud environment. We are dependent on third-party vendors to operate secure and reliable systems which may include data transfers over the internet. Any events which deny us use of vital operating or information systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations.\nWe also compete through our use of information technology. We strive to provide customers with timely, accurate, easy-to-access information about product availability, orders and delivery status using state-of-the-art systems. While we have processes for short-term failures and disaster recovery capability, a prolonged disruption of system or other failures in the reliability of our systems may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe could also experience a disruption of service or a compromise of our information security due to technical system flaws, clerical, data input or record-keeping errors, migration to new systems, or tampering or manipulation of our systems by employees or unauthorized third parties. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. Any security breach or compromise of our information systems could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, employee, supplier or company information, including our intellectual property, and result in significant losses, litigation, fines and costs. The security measures we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and data may not be sufficient to prevent breaches. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is evolving, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.\nAdditionally, our key partners, distributors or suppliers could experience a compromise of their information security due to technical system flaws, clerical, data input or record-keeping errors, or tampering or manipulation of their respective systems by employees or third parties, which may have an impact on our commercial sales, vendor, partner or other relationships.\nThe geographic concentration of our business could subject us to risks, including those associated with climate change, that may be greater than our competitors and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe primarily operate in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Our concentrated operations in the Americas could subject us to a greater degree of risk relative to our global, diversified competitors. We are particularly vulnerable to adverse events (including acts of terrorism, natural disasters, weather conditions, labor market disruptions and government actions) and economic conditions in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Adverse events or conditions in these geographic areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nClimate change and related extreme weather events in these geographic areas could result in slow or limited construction activity in the markets in which we operate, decreased availability and increased costs of manufacturing inputs or sourced products and an adverse impact to our operations if one of our manufacturing facilities were impacted by such an event, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe cannot provide any guarantees of future cash dividend payments or future repurchases of our common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program.\nSince December 2018, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The payment of any future cash dividends to our shareholders is not guaranteed and will depend on decisions that will be made by our Board of Directors based upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, business requirements and a determination that the declaration of cash dividends is in the best interest of our shareholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the payment of dividends.\nSince July 2016, our Board of Directors has approved share repurchases up to a total of $1,200.0 million. Repurchases under the program may be made through open market, block and privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans, at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate, subject to market and business conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors. The program does not obligate the company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to repurchase our common stock and we may discontinue plans to repurchase common stock at any time.\nPublic health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption and there is no guarantee that markets will fully recover from the impacts caused by the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19, or other public health pandemics, impacts our employees, operations, customers, suppliers and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic (and whether there is a resurgence or multiple resurgences in the future, including the impact of new variants); government actions taken in response to the pandemic, including mandatory shutdowns, vaccine or testing mandates; the availability, acceptance, distribution and continued effectiveness of vaccines; the impact on construction activity; supply chain disruptions; rising inflation; labor shortages; the effect on our customers demand for our ceiling and wall systems; sustained remote or hybrid work models; our ability to manufacture and sell our products; and the ability of our customers to pay for our products. For example, while many of our products support life sustaining activities and essential construction, we, and certain of our customers or suppliers, may be impacted by state actions, orders and policies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of non-life sustaining businesses, shelter-in-place orders, and travel, social distancing and quarantine policies, the implementation and enforcement of which vary by individual U.S. states and by individual\ncountries in the Americas. Any of these events could have material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91516, "SIC": 3290, "TIC": "AWI"}
