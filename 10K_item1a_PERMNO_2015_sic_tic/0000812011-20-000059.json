The risks described below should carefully be considered together with the other information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operations. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of an as yet unknown magnitude and duration. Any future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious disease could have a similar impact.\nGovernmental authorities nationally and in affected regions have taken and continue to take dramatic actions by mandating various restrictions in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, \u201cshelter at home\u2019\u2019 orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. Many experts predict that the outbreak will trigger a period of material global economic slowdown or a global recession, with particular risk to the travel and leisure industry, which is disproportionately impacted by travel restrictions and other public health restrictions.\nIn response to the continued challenges associated with the spread of COVID-19, we closed all of our North American mountain resorts, retail/rental stores and lodging properties early for the 2019/2020 North American ski season in March 2020. Additionally, although our Hotham and Falls Creek resorts opened for their winter season on July 6, 2020, we closed such resorts four days later due to a \u201cstay at home\u201d order put in place by the Victorian government as a result of a reemergence of COVID-19 in the region. The outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted our business and has had and is expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on our business, financial performance and condition, operating results, liquidity and cash flows. Factors that would negatively impact our ability to successfully operate during the current outbreak of COVID-19 or another pandemic include:\n\u2022\nour ability to open our North American Resorts for their winter season in a timely manner, if at all, and keep such Resorts open;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain guests given the risks, or perceived risks, of gathering in public places;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of guests to travel or purchase advanced commitment products, such as our portfolio of season pass products;\n\u2022\nexisting or future restrictions imposed by governmental authorities that may restrict our operations or the ability of our guests to return to our Resorts;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived deterioration or weakness in economic conditions, unemployment levels, the job or housing markets, consumer debt levels or consumer confidence, as well as other adverse economic or market conditions due to COVID-19 or otherwise, and their collective impacts on demand for travel and leisure;\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust capital spending and maintain sufficient liquidity to remain positioned for long-term success;\n\u2022\nour ability to incentivize and retain our current employees, reinstate our furloughed employees as we reopen, attract and hire sufficient future seasonal employees, and the risk of lawsuits related to COVID-19;\n\u2022\nour ability to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions on our access to capital necessary to fund operating costs, including maintenance capital spending, or to address maturing liabilities.\nThe extent and duration of the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our business, consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position and consolidated cash flows, will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the related impact on factors affecting guest behavior, including consumer confidence and spending and when we will be able to resume normal operations, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In April 2020 we introduced Epic Coverage for the 2020/2021 North American ski season, which provides refunds to all pass holders in the event of certain resort closures (including closures due to COVID-19) for any portion of the season that is not able to be utilized. Accordingly, to the extent that any of our Resorts would need to be closed for all or any portion of the 2020/2021 North American ski season (whether due to COVID-19 or otherwise), we could be required to provide a significant amount of refunds to our customers, which could have a material negative impact on our financial performance and condition.\nWe may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects and our credit ratings. The terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may further restrict our business operations. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. In addition, because of reduced travel demand, certain of our leased properties may not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses.\nCOVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial performance and condition, operating results, liquidity and cash flows. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the Risk Factors presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our subsequent filings with the SEC. Any future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious disease could have a similar impact.\nLeisure travel is particularly susceptible to various factors outside of our control, including terrorism, the uncertainty of military conflicts, the cost and availability of travel options and changing consumer preferences or willingness to travel.\nOur business is sensitive to the willingness of our guests to travel. Acts of terrorism, political events and developments in military conflicts in areas of the world from which we draw our guests could depress the public\u2019s propensity to travel and cause severe disruptions in both domestic and international air travel and consumer discretionary spending, which could reduce the number of visitors to our resorts and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Many of our guests travel by air and the impact of higher prices for commercial airline services, availability of air services and willingness of guests to travel by air could cause a decrease in visitation by Destination guests to our resorts. A significant portion of our guests also travel by vehicle and higher gasoline prices or willingness of guests to travel generally due to safety concerns could cause a decrease in visitation by guests who would typically drive to our resorts. Higher cost of travel may also affect the amount that guests are willing to spend at our resorts and could negatively impact our revenue particularly for lodging, ski school, dining and retail/rental.\nAdditionally, our success depends on our ability to attract visitors to our ski resorts. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, particularly those affecting the popularity of skiing and snowboarding, and other social and demographic trends could adversely affect the number of skier visits during a ski season. A significant decline in skier visits compared to historical levels would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the risk of prolonged weakness in general economic conditions including adverse effects on the overall travel and leisure related industries.\nSkiing, travel and tourism are discretionary recreational activities that can entail a relatively high cost of participation and may be adversely affected by economic slowdown or recession. Economic conditions in North America, Europe and parts of the rest of the world, including high unemployment, erosion of consumer confidence, sovereign debt issues and financial instability in the global markets, may potentially have negative effects on the travel and leisure industry and on our results of operations. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operations. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of an as yet unknown magnitude and duration.\u201d As a result of these and other economic uncertainties, we are experiencing and may continue to experience in the future, a change in booking trends including where guest reservations are made much closer to the actual date of stay, a decrease in the length of stay, a decrease in consumer spending and/or a decrease in group bookings. We cannot predict what further impact these uncertainties may continue to have on overall travel and leisure or more specifically, on our guest visitation, guest spending or other related trends and the ultimate impact it will have on our results of operations. Additionally, the actual or perceived fear of weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. This could be further exacerbated by the fact that we charge some of the highest prices for single day lift tickets and ancillary services in the ski industry; however, we offer pass products, including the Epic Day Pass, that are available at a discount to the single day lift tickets. In the event of a decrease in visitation and overall guest spending we may be required to offer a higher amount of discounts and incentives than we have historically, which would adversely impact our operating results. Our resorts also serve as a destination for international guests. To the extent there are material changes in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar or travel restrictions in place due to COVID-19, it could impact the volume of international visitation, which could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nWe are vulnerable to unfavorable weather conditions and the impact of natural disasters.\nOur ability to attract guests to our resorts is influenced by weather conditions and by the amount and timing of snowfall during the ski season. Unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect skier visits and our revenue and profits. Unseasonably warm weather may result in inadequate natural snowfall and reduce skiable terrain, which increases the cost of snowmaking and could render snowmaking, wholly or partially, ineffective in maintaining quality skiing conditions, including in areas which are not accessible by snowmaking equipment. On the other hand, excessive natural snowfall may significantly increase the costs incurred to groom trails and may make it difficult for guests to access our mountain resorts. In the past 20 years, our resorts in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Utah, the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Lake Tahoe and the Coast Mountains in British Columbia, Canada have averaged between 20 and 39 feet of annual snowfall, which is significantly in excess of the average for North American ski resorts. However, there can be no assurance that our resorts will receive seasonal snowfalls near their historical average in the future. As an example of weather variability, during the 2017/2018 North American ski season, we experienced historically low snowfall across our western U.S. resorts for the first half of the ski season, with snowfall in Vail, Beaver Creek and Park City through January 31, 2018 at the lowest levels recorded in over 30 years while Tahoe was more than 50% below the 20-year average. Additionally, during the 2018/2019 North American ski season, our western U.S. resorts experienced above-average snowfall while through December 31, 2019, our Pacific Northwest resorts (Whistler Blackcomb and Stevens Pass) experienced the lowest snowfall in over 30 years. Past snowfall levels or consistency of snow conditions can impact sales of pass products or other advanced bookings. Additionally, the early season snow conditions and skier perceptions of early season snow conditions can influence the momentum and success of the overall ski season. Unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect our resorts and lodging properties as guests tend to delay or postpone vacations if conditions differ from those that are typical at such resorts for a given season. Although we have created geographic diversification to help mitigate the impact of weather variability, there is no way for us to predict future weather patterns or the impact that weather patterns may have on our results of operations or visitation.\nA severe natural disaster, such as a forest fire, may interrupt our operations, damage our properties, reduce the number of guests who visit our resorts in affected areas and negatively impact our revenue and profitability. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair and recoup lost profits. Furthermore, such a disaster may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties or require evacuations and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. The ability to attract visitors to our resorts is also influenced by the aesthetics and natural beauty of the outdoor environment where our resorts are located. A severe forest fire or other severe impacts from naturally occurring events could negatively impact the natural beauty of our resorts and have a long-term negative impact on our overall guest visitation as it would take several years for the environment to recover.\nAdditionally, there is scientific research that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. The effect of climate change, including any impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of increased weather variability and/or warmer overall temperatures, which would likely adversely affect skier visits and our revenue and profits.\nFailure to maintain the integrity and security of our internal, employee or guest data could result in damages to our reputation and subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nOur business relies on the use of large volumes of data. We collect and retain guest data, including credit card numbers and other sensitive personal information, for various business purposes, such as processing transactions, marketing and other promotional purposes. We also maintain personal information about our employees. We store and use data in a variety of information systems, including some systems maintained by service providers. Maintaining the integrity and security of that data can be costly and is critical to our business, and our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. We could make faulty decisions if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. A significant theft, loss, loss of access to, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation, and could result in significant remedial and other expenses, fines, and/or litigation.\nCyberattacks could disrupt our business.\nDespite our efforts, information networks and systems are vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of sophisticated cyberattacks on network and information systems, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. We have experienced cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date. We have taken, and continue to take, steps to address these concerns by implementing security and internal controls. However, there can be no assurance that a system interruption, security breach or unauthorized access will not occur. Cyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated, which increases the difficulty and cost of detecting and\ndefending against them. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts across networks, systems and operations. Those events may include process breakdowns, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or may result from the acts of third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities. Any such interruption, breach or unauthorized access to our network or systems, or the networks or systems of our vendors, could adversely affect our business operations and result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, as well as impact our ability to meet regulatory or compliance obligations, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. These events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future.\nOur business is highly seasonal.\nOur mountain and lodging operations are highly seasonal in nature. Peak operating season for our North American Resorts is from late November to mid-April, and accordingly, revenue and profits from our mountain and most of our lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall. Conversely, peak operating seasons for our Australian resorts, GTLC and Flagg Ranch, mountain summer activities (including our Epic Discovery program), sightseeing and our golf courses generally occur from June to the end of September. Revenue and profits generated by our Australian resorts, GTLC and Flagg Ranch, mountain summer activities/sightseeing and golf peak season operations are not nearly sufficient to fully offset our off-season losses from our other mountain and lodging operations. For Fiscal 2020, approximately 83% of total combined Mountain and Lodging segment net revenue (excluding Lodging segment revenue associated with reimbursement of payroll costs) was earned during our second and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality is partially mitigated by the sale of pass products (which for Fiscal 2020 accounted for approximately 51% of the total lift revenue) predominately occurring during the period prior to the start of the ski season as the cash from those sales is collected in advance and revenue is mostly recognized in the second and third quarters. In addition, the timing of major holidays and school breaks can impact vacation patterns and therefore visitation at our mountain resorts and urban ski areas. If we were to experience an adverse event or realize a significant deterioration in our operating results during our peak periods (our fiscal second and third quarters) we would be unable to fully recover any significant declines due to the seasonality of our business (for example, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a premature closure to our 2019/2020 North American ski season in March 2020. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operations. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of an as yet unknown magnitude and duration.\u201d). Operating results for any three-month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe Forest Service authorized year-round recreational activities, which allows our mountain resorts on Forest Service land to offer more summer-season recreational opportunities, including our Epic Discovery program that we launched at Heavenly, Vail and Breckenridge. We anticipate that as these summer activities mature, and with Whistler Blackcomb\u2019s robust summer activities and the activities at our other resorts, we could realize incremental summer guest visitation and revenue. However, our summer activities may not generate the projected revenue and profit margins we expect, and even if our future plans are successful, we do not expect that these enhanced summer operations will fully mitigate the seasonal losses that our mountain operations experience from late spring to late fall.\nWe face significant competition.\nThe ski resort and lodging industries are highly competitive. During the 2018/2019 North American ski season (the ski season immediately prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), combined skier visits for all ski areas in North America were approximately 79.7 million. There are approximately 770 ski areas in North America, including approximately 475 in the U.S. that serve local and destination guests, and these ski areas can be more or less impacted by weather conditions based on their location and snowmaking capabilities. The factors that we believe are important to customers include:\n\u2022\nproximity to population centers;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of transportation to ski areas;\n\u2022\navailability and quality of lodging options in resort areas;\n\u2022\nease of travel to ski areas (including direct flights by major airlines);\n\u2022\npricing of lift tickets and/or pass products and the magnitude, quality and price of related ancillary services (ski school, dining and retail/rental), amenities and lodging;\n\u2022\nsnowmaking facilities;\n\u2022\ntype and quality of skiing and snowboarding offered;\n\u2022\nduration of the ski season;\n\u2022\nweather conditions; and\n\u2022\nreputation.\nThere are many competing options for our guests, including other major resorts in Colorado, Utah, California, Nevada, the Pacific Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and British Columbia, Canada, and other major destination ski areas worldwide. Our guests can choose from any of these alternatives, as well as non-skiing vacation options and destinations around the world. In addition, other forms of leisure such as sporting events and participation in other competing indoor and outdoor recreational activities are available to potential guests.\nRockResorts hotels, our other hotels and our property management business compete with numerous other hotel and property management companies that may have greater financial resources than we do and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to promotion of their offerings than us.\nThe high fixed cost structure of mountain resort operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline.\nThe cost structure of our mountain resort operations has a significant fixed component with variable expenses including, but not limited to, land use permit or lease fees and other resort related fees; credit card fees; retail/rental cost of sales; labor; and resort, dining and ski school operations. Any material declines in the economy, elevated geopolitical uncertainties and/or significant changes in historical snowfall patterns, as well as other risk factors discussed herein, could adversely affect revenue. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operations. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues of an as yet unknown magnitude and duration.\u201d As such, our margins, profits and cash flows may be materially reduced due to declines in revenue given our relatively high fixed cost structure. In addition, increases in wages and other labor costs, energy, healthcare, insurance, transportation and fuel, property taxes, minimum lease payments and other expenses included in our fixed cost structure may also reduce our margin, profits and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to fund resort capital expenditures.\nWe regularly expend capital to construct, maintain and renovate our mountain resorts and properties in order to remain competitive, maintain the value and brand standards of our mountain resorts and properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations. We cannot always predict where capital will need to be expended in a given fiscal year and capital expenditures can increase due to forces beyond our control. In March 2020, we announced our full capital plan for calendar year 2020, pursuant to which we anticipated we would spend approximately $210 million to $215 million, including one-time items associated with integrations, the one-time Triple Peaks and Stevens Pass transformation plan, one-time Peak Resorts capital improvements, real estate related capital and approximately $4 million of reimbursable investments. Excluding such one-time items, we expected to spend approximately $155 million to $160 million on resort capital expenditures during calendar year 2020. On April 1, 2020, as part of our response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, we announced a reduction to our capital plan for calendar year 2020 by approximately $80 million to $85 million, with the vast majority of these savings coming from the deferral of many of our discretionary capital projects. We are planning to defer all new chair lifts, terrain expansions and other mountain and base area improvements, while continuing with the vast majority of our maintenance capital spending.\nOur ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or to borrow from third parties in the debt or equity markets. We cannot provide assurances that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such capital expenditures, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all. Our ability to generate cash flow and to obtain third-party financing will depend upon many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour future operating performance;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and economic conditions affecting the resort industry, the ski industry and the capital markets;\n\u2022\ncompetition; and\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory matters affecting our operations and business;\nAny inability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain adequate third-party financing could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects and/or plans.\nA disruption in our water supply would impact our snowmaking capabilities and operations.\nOur operations are heavily dependent upon our access to adequate supplies of water for snowmaking and to otherwise conduct our operations. Our mountain resorts are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to water rights. Changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations. In addition, a severe and prolonged drought may adversely affect our water supply and increase the cost of snowmaking. A significant change in law or policy, impact from climate change or any other interference with our access to adequate supplies of water to support our current operations or an expansion of our operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on various government permits and landlord approvals at our U.S. resorts.\nOur U.S. resort operations require permits and approvals from certain federal, state and local authorities, including the Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the States of Vermont and New Hampshire and the NPS. Virtually all of our ski trails and related activities, including our current and proposed comprehensive summer activities plan, at Vail Mountain, Breckenridge, Keystone, Crested Butte, Stevens Pass, Heavenly, Kirkwood, Mount Snow, Wildcat, a majority of Beaver Creek and portions of Attitash are located on National Forest land. The Forest Service has granted us permits to use these lands, but maintains the right to review and approve many operational matters, as well as the location, design and construction of improvements in these areas. Currently, our permits expire on the following dates:\nThe Forest Service can terminate or amend these permits if, in its opinion, such termination is required in the public interest. A termination or amendment of any of our permits could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operations. In order to undertake improvements and new development, we must apply for permits and other approvals. These efforts, if unsuccessful, could impact our expansion efforts. Furthermore, Congress may materially increase the fees we pay to the Forest Service for use of these National Forest lands. Stowe and Okemo are partially located on land we lease from the State of Vermont, and Mount Sunapee is located on land we lease from the State of New Hampshire. We are required to seek approval from such states for certain developments and improvements made to the resort. Certain other resorts are operated on land under long term leases with third parties. For example, operations at our Northstar, Park City and Mad River Mountain resorts are conducted pursuant to long-term leases with third parties who require us to operate the resorts in accordance with the terms of the leases and seek certain approvals from the respective landlords for improvements made to the resorts. The initial lease term for Northstar with affiliates of EPR Properties expires in January 2027 and allows for three 10-year renewal options. We entered into a transaction agreement, master lease agreement and ancillary transaction documents with affiliate companies of Talisker Corporation (\u201cTalisker\u201d), and the initial lease term for our Park City resort with Talisker expires in May 2063 and allows for six 50-year renewal options. Additionally, GTLC and Flagg Ranch operate under concessionaire agreements with the NPS that expire on December 31, 2021 and October 31, 2026, respectively. There is no guarantee that at the end of the initial lease/license or agreements under which we operate our resorts we will renew or, if desired, be able to negotiate new terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, our resorts that operate on privately-owned land are subject to local land use regulation and oversight by county and/or town government and may not be able to obtain the requisite approvals needed for resort improvements or expansions. Failure to comply with the provisions, obligations and terms (including renewal requirements and deadlines) of our material permits and leases could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe rely on foreign government leases and landlord approvals, and are subject to certain related laws and regulations, at our international resorts.\nOur international resort operations require permits and approvals from certain foreign authorities, including the Province of British Columbia and the New South Wales and Victoria, Australia governments. Our operations at Whistler Blackcomb are located on Crown Land within the traditional territory of the Squamish and Lil\u2019wat Nations, and the operations and future development of both Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb Mountain are governed by Master Development Agreements, which expire on February 23, 2077. We have a lease and a license for Perisher within the Kosciusko National Park which expires in June 2048, with an option to renew for an additional period of 20 years. Perisher relies on a suite of planning approvals (and existing use rights) granted under the Australian EPA Act to operate the resort. Strategic planning documents have been adopted to provide a framework for the assessment and approval of future development at the resort. Perisher also holds a number of environmental approvals to regulate its operations, including an environment protection license and a suite of dangerous goods licenses related to the storage of diesel, heating oil and propane in storage tanks across the resort. Each of Falls Creek and a majority of Hotham is located in the Alpine National Park in Victoria, Australia that is permanently reserved under the Crown Land Act and subject to the ARM Act. The ARM Act established the Falls Creek RMB and the Hotham RMB, which is responsible for the management and collection of fees from Falls Creek and Hotham, respectively, and the ARM Regulations give each of the Falls Creek RMB and the Hotham RMB certain discretion over the operations of Falls Creek and Hotham, respectively, including the authority to (i) declare the snow season, (ii) temporarily close the applicable resort if entry would be a significant danger to public safety, and (iii) determine which portions of the applicable resort are open to the public and the activities that are permitted on those portions of such resort. There is no guarantee that at the end of the initial lease/license or agreements under which we operate our resorts we will renew or, if desired, be able to negotiate new terms that are favorable to us. Failure to comply with the provisions, obligations and terms (including renewal requirements and deadlines) of our material permits and leases could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of business.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of wastes and other liquids, land use, remediation of contaminated sites, protection of natural resources such as wetlands and sustainable visitor or tourist use and enjoyment. For example, future expansions of certain of our mountain facilities must comply with applicable forest plans approved under the National Forest Management Act, federal, state and foreign wildlife protection laws or local zoning requirements, and in Vermont, our operations must comply with Act 250, which regulates the impacts of development to, among other things, waterways, air, wildlife and earth resources, and any projects must be completed pursuant to a Master Plan. In addition, most projects to improve, upgrade or expand our ski areas are subject to environmental review under the NEPA, FRPA, Act 250, the CEQA, the Australian NPW Act, the Australian EPA Act or the Australian EP Act, as applicable. The NEPA and CEQA require the Forest Service, or other governmental entities, to study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include various alternatives in its analysis. Our ski area improvement proposals may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project. Our facilities are subject to risks associated with mold and other indoor building contaminants. From time to time our operations are subject to inspections by environmental regulators or other regulatory agencies. We are also subject to worker health and safety requirements as well as various state and local public health laws, rules, regulations and orders related to COVID-19, including mask and social distancing requirements. We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental, health and safety requirements. However, our efforts to comply do not eliminate the risk that we may be held liable, incur fines or be subject to claims for damages, and that the amount of any liability, fines, damages or remediation costs may be material for, among other things, the presence or release of regulated materials at, on or emanating from properties we now or formerly owned or operated, newly discovered environmental impacts or contamination at or from any of our properties, or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their enforcement.\nChanges in security and privacy laws and regulations could increase our operating costs, increase our exposure to fines and litigation, and adversely affect our ability to market our products, properties and services effectively.\nThe information, security, and privacy requirements imposed by applicable laws and governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are increasingly demanding in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or our exposure to potential fines and litigation in connection with the enforcement of such regulations, or otherwise impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. Any future changes or restrictions in U.S. or international privacy laws could also adversely affect our operations, including our ability to transfer guest data. Additionally, we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing, online advertising, and postal mailings. Changes in U.S. or international law affecting marketing, solicitation or privacy, could adversely affect our marketing activities and force changes in our marketing strategy or increase the costs of marketing. We also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships, and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies\u2019 marketing materials. If access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business or competitive position.\nWe depend on the use of sophisticated information technology and systems for central reservations, point of sale, marketing, customer relationship management and communication, procurement, maintaining the privacy of guest and employee data, administration and technologies we make available to our guests. We must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems, network security and infrastructure. Our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands and to respond to competitive service and product offerings. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost-effective manner. Delays or difficulties implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner, to the extent anticipated, or at all. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to process transactions and could decrease the quality of service we offer to our guests. Also, we may be unable to devote adequate financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future. If any of these events occur, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nWe may not be able to hire, train, reward and retain adequate team members and determine and maintain adequate staffing, which may impact our ability to achieve our operating, growth and financial objectives.\nOur long-term growth and profitability depend partially on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees to work in and manage our resorts. Adequate staffing and retention of qualified employees is a critical factor affecting our guests\u2019 experiences in our resorts. Maintaining adequate staffing requires precise workforce planning which has been complicated and is unpredictable due the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on guest preferences and on labor markets. The market for the most qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must provide competitive wages, benefits and workplace conditions to attract and retain our most qualified employees. Year round employees may seek other employment and seasonal employees may decline to return, to be re-hired, or to be hired for the first time during this coming winter season. Personal or public health concerns related to COVID-19 might make some employees and potential candidates reluctant to work in enclosed environments such as our hotels, restaurants and retail/rental stores. Resort-area housing could be even more limited than usual, making it difficult for employees to obtain available, affordable housing. A shortage of international workers based on immigration and cultural exchange limitations currently in place, failure to recruit and retain new domestic employees in a timely manner, or higher than expected attrition levels all could affect our ability to open and operate parts of our resorts, deliver guest service at traditional margins or achieve our labor cost objectives.\nWe depend on a seasonal workforce.\nOur mountain and lodging operations are highly dependent on a large seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal staffing needs each season and work to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel as the business requires. Changes in immigration laws could also impact our workforce because we recruit and hire foreign nationals as part of our seasonal workforce. For example, on June 22, 2020, an executive order was executed in the United States suspending the issuance of several visas for foreign workers until at least the end of 2020. Increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our workforce, including increased labor costs.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, sick leave pay, overtime compensation and other working conditions, work authorization requirements, discrimination and family and medical leave. Cost of labor and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost of our operations. Labor shortages, affordable employee housing shortages and increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs and labor-related benefits. As minimum wage rates increase, including further potential federal and state legislative changes to the minimum wage rate, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above the minimum wage. From time to time, we have also experienced non-union employees attempting to unionize. While only a very small portion of our employees are unionized at present, we may experience additional union activity in the future, which could lead to disruptions in our business, increases in our operating costs and/or constraints on our operating flexibility. These potential labor impacts could adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we do not retain our key personnel, our business may suffer.\nThe success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of key management personnel, including our senior executive officers. If any of these persons were to leave, it could be difficult to replace them, and our business could be harmed. We do not maintain \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on any of our employees.\nWe are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business.\nWe are, from time to time, subject to various asserted or unasserted legal proceedings and claims. Any such proceedings or claims, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. While we believe we have adequate insurance coverage and/or accrue for loss contingencies for all known matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, we cannot provide any assurance that the outcome of all current or future litigation proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nOur business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our business.\nA negative public image or other adverse events could affect the reputation of one or more of our mountain resorts, other destination resorts, hotel properties and other businesses or more generally impact the reputation of our brands. Information posted on social media platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our reputation or business. Any resulting harm on our business may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. If the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our intellectual property, including our trademarks, domain names and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. Any misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights could also diminish the value of our brands and their market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nThere is a risk of accidents occurring at our mountain resorts or competing mountain resorts which may reduce visitation and negatively impact our operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our resorts, services and activities, including summer activities, and our corporate and management integrity. While we maintain and promote an on-mountain safety program, there are inherent risks associated with our resort activities. From time to time in the past, accidents and other injuries have occurred on Resort property. An accident or an injury at any of our resorts or at resorts operated by competitors, particularly an accident or injury involving the safety of guests and employees that receives media attention, could negatively impact our brand or reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence in us, reduce visitation at our resorts, and negatively impact our results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. If any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations.\nOur acquisitions might not be successful.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions, including most recently Peak Resorts, Hotham and Falls Creek, and may continue to acquire certain mountain resorts, hotel properties and other businesses complementary to our own, as well as developable land in proximity to our resorts. Acquisitions are complex to evaluate, execute and integrate. We cannot ensure that we will be able to accurately evaluate or successfully integrate and manage acquired mountain resorts, properties and businesses and increase our profits from these operations. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions both domestically and internationally and intend to actively pursue acquisition opportunities, some of which could be significant. As a result, we face various risks from acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\nour evaluation of the synergies and/or long-term benefits of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nour inability to integrate acquired businesses into our operations as planned;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nincreased expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support the acquired entities, information technology, personnel and other integration expenses);\n\u2022\npotential increased debt leverage;\n\u2022\npotential issuance of dilutive equity securities;\n\u2022\nlitigation arising from acquisition activity;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of goodwill, intangible or tangible assets; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated problems or liabilities.\nIn addition, we run the risk that any new acquisitions may fail to perform in accordance with expectations, and that estimates of the costs of improvements and integration for such properties may prove inaccurate.\nWe have recently acquired companies that were not subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), and, therefore, they may lack the internal controls of a U.S. public company, which could ultimately affect our ability to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nWe have recently acquired companies that were not previously subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under Sarbanes-Oxley and accordingly were not required to establish and maintain an internal control infrastructure meeting the standards promulgated under Sarbanes-Oxley. Our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2020 did not include certain elements of the internal controls of Peak Resorts, which was acquired during our fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.\nAlthough our management will continue to review and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls in light of these acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurances that there will be no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the internal control structure of our acquired businesses may cause significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks.\nAs a result of the acquisitions of Whistler Blackcomb in Canada and Perisher, Hotham and Falls Creek in Australia, and potential future international acquisitions, we have and may continue to increase our operations outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:\n\u2022\nrestriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to general market and economic conditions outside the United States;\n\u2022\nadditional political risk;\n\u2022\ncompliance with international laws and regulations (including anti-corruption regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act);\n\u2022\ndata security; and\n\u2022\nforeign tax treaties and policies.\nExchange rate fluctuations could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results.\nWe are exposed to currency translation risk because the results of Whistler Blackcomb, Perisher, Hotham and Falls Creek are reported in their local currencies, which we then translate to U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates, in particular between the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and the U.S. dollar, affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our financial results. We currently do not enter into hedging arrangements to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will increase as our international operations grow and if we acquire additional international resorts.\nWe are subject to accounting and tax regulations and use certain estimates and judgments that may differ significantly from actual results, including adverse determinations by tax authorities.\nImplementation of existing and future legislation, rulings, standards and interpretations from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other regulatory bodies could affect the presentation of our financial statements and related disclosures. Future regulatory requirements could significantly change our current accounting practices and disclosures. Such changes in the presentation of our financial statements and related disclosures could change an investor\u2019s interpretation or perception of our financial position and results of operations.\nWe use many methods, estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies (see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7 of this Form 10-K). Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and resulted in broad and significantly complex changes that impacted the corporate tax rate, our deferred income taxes and the taxation of our foreign earnings. The comprehensive impact of the Tax Act is subject to future guidance and interpretations by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies, which could impact our effective tax rate and may have adverse or uncertain effects on our business and financial condition.\nOn March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. Although we continue to examine the impacts the CARES Act may have on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, we are immediately benefiting from the tax credit and payment deferment provisions of the CARES Act.\nWe are also subject to the examination of tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur stock price is highly volatile.\nThe market price of our stock is highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchange in valuations, including our real estate held for sale;\n\u2022\nchanges in the overall travel, gaming, hospitality and leisure industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors or such guidance provided by us;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or companies in the travel, gaming, hospitality and leisure industries of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, plans, prospects, service offerings or operating results;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our securities;\n\u2022\ntrading and volume fluctuations;\n\u2022\nother risk factors as discussed herein; and\n\u2022\nother unforeseen events.\nStock markets in the U.S. have often experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions including acts of terrorism, military conflicts, outbreak of a contagious disease, prolonged economic uncertainty, a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will pay dividends, or if paid, that dividend payments will be consistent with historical levels.\nIn fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors approved the commencement of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock at an annual rate of $0.60 per share, subject to quarterly declaration. The most recent dividend declared on March 5, 2020 was in the amount of $1.76 per share. Dividends are funded through cash flow from operations, available cash on hand and borrowings under the revolver portion of the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cVail Holdings Credit Agreement\u201d). The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and is limited by applicable state law concepts of available funds for distribution, as well as contractual restrictions. As a result, the amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon a number of factors, including our available cash on hand, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, restrictions contained in our senior credit facility, the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, any future contractual restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. In addition, our Board of Directors may also suspend the payment of dividends at any time if it deems such action to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. For example, on April 1, 2020, in response to actions taken in response to COVID-19, we announced that our Board of Directors suspended our quarterly dividend for at least two quarters. Additionally, during the period that we are subject to the Temporary Waiver Period (See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure-Restrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may prevent or limit our future business plans.\u201d), we are prohibited from paying any dividends or making share repurchases, unless (x) no default or potential default exists under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and (y) we have liquidity of at least $400.0 million, and the aggregate amount of dividends paid and share repurchases made by us during the Temporary Waiver Period may not exceed $38.2 million in any fiscal quarter. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment in Vail Resorts, Inc. This appreciation may not occur and our stock may in fact depreciate in value.\nAnti-takeover provisions affecting us could prevent or delay a change of control that is beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, provisions of our debt instruments and other agreements and provisions of applicable Delaware law and applicable federal and state regulations may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that holders of our securities may consider favorable. These provisions could:\n\u2022\ndelay, defer or prevent a change in control of our Company;\n\u2022\ndiscourage bids for our securities at a premium over the market price;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our securities; or\n\u2022\nimpede the ability of the holders of our securities to change our management.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, to react to changes in the economy or our industry, to fulfill our obligations under the Notes, to pay our other debts, and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of July 31, 2020, we had $2.4 billion in total indebtedness outstanding. This amount includes (i) $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of our unsecured senior notes issued on May 4, 2020 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), (ii) $1.2 billion of indebtedness pursuant to the term loan facility under Vail Holdings, Inc.\u2019s Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the \u201cVail Holdings Credit Agreement\u2019\u2019), (iii) $58.2 million of indebtedness under the Whistler Credit Agreement, (iv) $346.0 million with respect to the Canyons Obligation, (v) $114.2 million with respect to the EPR Secured Notes under the master credit and security agreements and other related agreements with EPT Ski Properties, Inc. and its affiliates (\u201cEPR\u2019\u2019), as amended (collectively, the \u201cEPR Agreements\u2019\u2019 and together with the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and the Whistler Credit Agreement, the \u201cCredit Agreements,\u2019\u2019 and such facilities, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u2019\u2019) and (vi) $51.5 million with respect to the EB-5 Development Notes. Our borrowings under the Vail Holdings Credit\nAgreement are subject to interest rate changes substantially increasing our risk to changes in interest rates. Borrowings under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, including the term loan facility, currently bear interest annually at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.50% and, for amounts in excess of $400.0 million, LIBOR is subject to a floor of 0.75% (during the Temporary Waiver Period, as defined below). Subsequent to the expiration of the Temporary Waiver Period (as defined below), interest rate margins may fluctuate based upon the ratio of our Net Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing four-quarter basis. We also have, on a cumulative basis, minimum lease payment obligations under operating leases of approximately $333.4 million as of July 31, 2020. Our level of indebtedness and minimum lease payment obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, including the annual payments under the Canyons lease, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, real estate developments, marketing efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds, refinance debt, or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under our outstanding debt; and\n\u2022\ncause potential or existing customers to not contract with us due to concerns over our ability to meet our financial obligations, such as insuring against our professional liability risks, under such contracts.\nFurthermore, our debt under our Credit Facilities bears interest at variable rates. We may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our senior credit facility and the Notes do not fully prohibit us from doing so. If we incur additional debt, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nRestrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit agreements and the indenture governing the Notes may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities and strategic initiatives that may be in our long-term best interests.\nOur credit agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt or issue capital stock;\n\u2022pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022incur certain liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022merge or consolidate;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us or the guarantors;\n\u2022designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022transfer or sell assets.\nOn April 28, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, pursuant to which we will be exempt from complying with the agreement\u2019s maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio financial maintenance covenants for each of the fiscal quarters ending July 31, 2020 through January 31, 2022 (unless we make a one-time irrevocable election to terminate such exemption period prior to such date) (such period, the \u201cFinancial Covenants Temporary Waiver Period\u201d), after which we will again be required to comply with such covenants starting with the fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2022 (or such earlier fiscal quarter as elected by us). Additionally, pursuant to this amendment, we are required to comply with a monthly minimum liquidity test (defined as unrestricted cash and temporary cash investments of Vail Resorts, Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries and available commitments under our revolving credit facility) of not less than $150.0 million, during the period beginning July 31, 2020 and ending on the date VHI delivers a compliance certificate for the Company and its subsidiaries\u2019 first fiscal quarter following the end of the Financial Covenants Temporary Waiver Period (such period, the \u201cTemporary Waiver Period\u201d).\nDuring the Temporary Waiver Period, we are prohibited from the following (unless majority approval of the lenders is obtained under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement):\n\u2022\npaying any dividends or making share repurchases, unless (x) no default or potential default exists under the Credit Agreement and (y) the Company has liquidity of at least $400.0 million, and the aggregate amount of dividends paid and share repurchases made by the Company during the Temporary Waiver Period may not exceed $38.2 million in any fiscal quarter;\n\u2022\nmaking capital expenditures in excess of $200.0 million per 12-month period ending January 31, other than non-recurring extraordinary capital expenditures incurred in connection with emergency repairs, life safety repairs or ordinary course maintenance repairs;\n\u2022\nincurring any indebtedness secured by the collateral under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement other than pursuant to the existing revolving commitments under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nmaking (i) non-ordinary course investments in unrestricted subsidiaries unless the Company has liquidity of at least $300.0 million and (ii) investments in non-subsidiaries in excess of $50.0 million in the aggregate; and\n\u2022\nacquiring all or a majority of the capital stock or all or any substantial portion of the assets of any entity or merging or consolidating with another entity.\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022\ngrant or permit liens;\n\u2022\nengage in sale/leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nengage in a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the Whistler Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the ability of Whistler Mountain Resort Limited Partnership and Blackcomb Skiing Enterprises Limited Partnership (together \u201cThe WB Partnerships\u201d) and their respective subsidiaries, and the EPR Agreements contain restrictions on the ability of Peak Resorts and its subsidiaries, to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us or the guarantors. We and our subsidiaries are subject to other covenants, representations and warranties in respect of our Credit Facilities, including financial covenants as defined in the Credit Agreements. Events beyond our control, including the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nThere can be no assurance that we will meet the financial covenants contained in our credit agreements, when in effect. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants, or suffer a material adverse change which restricts our borrowing ability under our Credit Facilities, we would not be able to borrow funds thereunder without a waiver. Any inability to borrow could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a breach, if uncured, could cause a default under the applicable agreement(s) governing our indebtedness, in which case such we may be required to repay these borrowings before their due date. We may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\nIn March 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock. In July 2008, the Board of Directors increased the authorization by an additional 3,000,000 shares, and in December 2015, the Board increased the authorization by an additional 1,500,000 shares for a total authorization to repurchase shares of up to 7,500,000 shares. Since inception of its share repurchase program through July 31, 2020, the Company has repurchased 6,161,141 shares at a cost of approximately $404.4 million. As of July 31, 2020, 1,338,859 shares remained available to repurchase under the existing share repurchase program which has no expiration date.\nAlthough our Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior\nnotice. In addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.", "PERMNO": 84588, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "MTN"}
