{"cik": "1681682", "company": "ENDRA Life Sciences Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes, before investing in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face, but include the most significant factors currently known by us that make investing in our securities speculative or risky. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses, we may never achieve or maintain profitability, and we will need to raise significant additional capital if we are going to continue as a going concern.\nWe have limited commercial experience upon which investors may evaluate our prospects. We have only generated limited revenues to date and have a history of losses from operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $68,690,810. Our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe will require additional capital in the near term to continue as a going concern to proceed with the commercialization of our planned TAEUS applications and to meet our growth and profitability targets. We have expended and expect to continue to expend significant resources on hiring of personnel, payroll and benefits, continued scientific and potential product research and development, potential product testing and pre-clinical and clinical investigations, expenses associated with the development of relationships with strategic partners, intellectual property development and prosecution, marketing and promotion, capital expenditures, working capital, and general and administrative expenses. We also expect to incur costs and expenses related to consulting, laboratory development, and the hiring of scientists and other operational personnel.\nWe may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs and our failure to obtain financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs and commercialization efforts.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in order to finance the full commercialization of our NAFLD TAEUS application and to complete the development of any other TAEUS application through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds from offerings of common stock and convertible notes, as well as sales of our discontinued Nexus 128 system. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. Therefore, we will require additional capital in order to: (i) continue to conduct research and development activities; (ii) continue to conduct clinical studies; (iii) fund the costs of seeking regulatory approval of TAEUS applications; (iv) expand our sales and marketing infrastructure; (v) acquire complementary business technology or products; and (vi) respond to business opportunities, challenges, increased regulatory obligations or unforeseen circumstances. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews associated with our future products, including TAEUS applications;\n\u00b7\nthe progress, timing, costs and outcomes of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our planned and potential future clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and expenses of expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of developing variations of our TAEUS applications and, if necessary, obtaining regulatory clearance of such variations;\n\u00b7\nthe degree of success we experience in commercializing our products, particularly our TAEUS applications;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which our TAEUS applications are adopted by hospitals for use by primary care physicians, hepatologists, radiologists and oncologists for diagnosis of fatty liver disease and the thermal ablation of lesions;\n\u00b7\nthe number and types of future products we develop and commercialize;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7\nthe extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses;\n\u00b7\nthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals, including the potential that the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of sales and other revenues from technologies and products that we may commercialize, if any, including the selling prices for such potential products and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement;\n\u00b7\nselling and marketing costs associated with our potential products, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7\ncash requirements of any future acquisitions and/or the development of other products;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of operating as a public company;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale, outsourced manufacturing activities; and\n\u00b7\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments.\nWe may raise funds in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities in order to access funds for our capital needs. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to incur debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our Company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. See \u201cFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plan, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the price of our securities to fall.\u201d below. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or products or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and our collaborators and strategic partners may not perform as expected.\nGeneral market conditions or the market price of our common stock may not support capital raising transactions such as a public or private offering of our common stock or other securities. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products, or materially curtail or reduce our operations. We could be forced to sell or dispose of our rights or assets. Any inability to raise adequate funds on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition, including the possibility that a lack of funds could cause our business to fail and liquidate with little or no return to investors.\nOur efforts may never result in the successful development of commercial applications based on our TAEUS technology.\nOur TAEUS technology is still in development. We have received regulatory clearance for the commercial sale of our NAFLD application in the European Union but otherwise do not have any applications for our TAEUS technology approved for sale. Applications for our TAEUS technology, even if approved for sale, may never become commercially viable or generate significant revenue. Our ability to generate significant revenues and, ultimately, achieve profitability will depend on whether we can obtain additional capital when we need it, complete the development of our technology, receive all required regulatory approvals for our TAEUS applications and find customers who will purchase our future products or strategic partners that will incorporate our technology into their products. Even if we develop commercially viable applications for our TAEUS technology, which may include licensing, we may never recover our research and development expenses and we may never be able to produce material revenues or operate on a profitable basis.\nOur research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging technologies, including, without limitation, unanticipated technical or other problems, the inability to develop a product that may be sold at an acceptable price point and the possible insufficiency of funds needed in order to complete development of these products. Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot complete, or if we experience significant delays in developing applications based on, our TAEUS technology, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the success of applications for our TAEUS platform.\nOur ability to generate meaningful revenues in the future will depend on the successful development and commercialization of our TAEUS platform applications. The commercial success of our TAEUS platform applications and our ability to generate revenues will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nour successful development of applications for our TAEUS technology, such as those we intend to pursue for the diagnosis of NAFLD and the monitoring of thermal ablation surgery, and the acceptance in the marketplace by physicians and patients of such applications;\n\u00b7\nthe successful design and manufacturing of a device or devices which enable the use of our TAEUS technology by physicians on their patients;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nsufficient coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully market our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to demonstrate that our TAEUS applications have advantages over competing products and procedures;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and nature of competition from competing or alternative imaging products; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing, distribution and sales force capabilities.\nOur TAEUS platform applications may not achieve adequate market acceptance by the physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.\nOur TAEUS applications that receive regulatory approval may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If our TAEUS applications do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from sales. The degree of market acceptance of products based on our TAEUS platform will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\npotential or perceived advantages or disadvantages compared to alternative products;\n\u00b7\npricing relative to competitive products and availability of third-party coverage or reimbursement;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of bringing our product to market as compared to possible other new entrants to the market;\n\u00b7\nour ability to effectively raise market awareness and explain product benefits and whether we have resources sufficient to do so;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience, dependability and ease of administration; and\n\u00b7\nwillingness of the target patient population to try new products and of physicians to utilize such products.\nOur revenues will be adversely affected if, due to these or other factors, the products we are able to commercialize do not gain significant market acceptance.\nPublic health crises, such as the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus which causes COVID-19, and variants of the virus, can adversely impact our business, including our pre-sales activities, clinical trials and ability to obtain regulatory approvals.\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and variants of the virus continue to spread to countries around the world . The level and nature of the disruption caused by COVID-19 is unpredictable, may be cyclical and long-lasting and varies from location to location. Beginning in March 2020, we undertook temporary precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including by requiring most employees to work remotely, pausing all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees, and limiting employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings, to the extent those events and meetings are continuing. As a cash-conserving measure taken in light of the adverse economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 we reduced the cash salaries of members of management by 33% for the remainder of 2020, including the salaries of our executive officers. In lieu of cash, the Company paid this portion of management salaries in the form of restricted stock units that vested over the remainder of the year. Additionally, we amended our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy to provide that our non-employee directors\u2019 annual retainers for the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2020 were paid in in the form of restricted stock units rather than cash. We may take additional measures to mitigate the effects to our business caused by COVID-19, any of which could negatively affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our clinical trial activities. Patient visits in ongoing clinical trials have been delayed, for example, due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 outbreak, travel restrictions imposed by governments, and the inability to access sites for initiation and monitoring. The continued spread of COVID-19 could further adversely affect our clinical trial operations in the United States and elsewhere, including our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in their geography. Further, some patients may be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines or travel restrictions impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, or if the patients become infected with COVID-19 themselves, which would delay our ability to conduct clinical trials or release clinical trial results. COVID-19 may also affect employees of third-party contract research organizations located in affected geographies that we rely upon to carry out our clinical trials, which could result in inefficiencies due to reductions in staff and disruptions to work environments. In addition, COVID-19 has had an effect on the business at FDA and other health authorities by causing them to reallocate resources to addressing the pandemic, which has resulted in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our NAFLD TAEUS application.\nThe spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also negatively affect the operations at our third-party manufacturers, which could result in delays or disruptions in the commercialization of our products. In addition, we have taken, and may continue to take, precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring all employees to work remotely, suspending all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees, and discouraging employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings, which affects our business, including by attending industry events and conducting marketing activities virtually rather than in-person.\nIn addition to the foregoing effects, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak or similar pandemics we have and may in the future experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including:\n\u00b7\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities and attendance at industry events due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures;\n\u00b7\ndelays or difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical trials of our TAEUS FLIP device;\n\u00b7\ninterruption or delays in the operations of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, which may impact approval timelines;\n\u00b7\nabsenteeism or loss of employees at the Company, or at our collaborator companies, due to health reasons or government restrictions or otherwise, that are needed to develop, validate, manufacture and perform other necessary functions for our operations;\n\u00b7\nsupply chain disruptions making it difficult for our collaborator companies to order and receive materials needed for the manufacture of our TAEUS product;\n\u00b7\ngovernment responses including orders that make it difficult for us, our supplier and our potential customers to remain open for business, and other seen and unforeseen actions taken by government agencies;\n\u00b7\nequipment failures, loss of utilities and other disruptions that could impact our operations or render them inoperable; and\n\u00b7\neffects of a local or global recession or depression that could depress economic conditions for a prolonged period and limit access to capital by the Company.\nThese and other factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen in the United States or locally at the location of our offices or clinical trials, each of which could further adversely impact our business generally, and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and results.\nWe may not remain commercially viable if there is an inadequate level of reimbursement by governmental programs and other third-party payors for our planned products or associated procedures.\nMedical imaging products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the United States), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the services provided to their patients.\nThird-party payors and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Reimbursement decisions by payors for these services are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services\u2019 assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies and decisions confer different, and sometimes conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies and decisions are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates, often downwards, indirectly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be covered by third-party payors, that adequate reimbursement will be available or, even if payment is available, that third-party payors\u2019 coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nWe have limited data regarding the efficacy of our TAEUS platform applications. If any of our applications that receive regulatory approval do not perform in accordance with our expectations, we are unlikely to successfully commercialize our applications.\nSince our success depends in large part on the medical and third-party payors community\u2019s acceptance of our TAEUS applications, even if we receive regulatory approval for our applications, we believe that we will need to obtain additional clinical data from users of our applications to persuade medical professions to use our applications. We may also be required to conduct post-approval clinical testing to obtain such additional data. Clinical testing is expensive, can take a significant amount of time to complete and can have uncertain outcomes. Negative results of these clinical studies could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nWe cannot be certain that results from limited animal and human studies of any of our TAEUS applications will be indicative of future studies or that any of our TAEUS applications will be successfully commercialized.\nTo successfully commercialize any application based on our TAEUS platform technology, we expect it will be necessary to conduct various pre-clinical and human studies to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for human use. In October 2018 we initiated certain human studies of our TAEUS device targeting NAFLD. In September 2019, we reported top-level findings from a clinical study conducted by CIMTEC relating to the feasibility of our TAEUS application for NAFLD. This data enabled us to obtain CE mark approval for our NAFLD TAEUS application. However, there can be no assurance that results from these studies are indicative of results that would be achieved in future animal studies or human clinical studies of this or any future TAEUS applications, which may be required in order for our applications incorporating our technology to obtain or maintain regulatory approval, including as required to support our submission for classification of our NAFLD TAEUS device as a Class II device under the FDA\u2019s de novo review process.. Even if clinical trials or other studies demonstrate safety and effectiveness of any applications of our technology and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any of such application will depend upon their acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party payers and on our partners\u2019 ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize a device for such application.\nOur limited commercial experience makes it difficult to evaluate our business, predict our future results or forecast our financial performance and growth.\nWe discontinued our initial pre-clinical Nexus 128 product in 2010 and our NAFLD TAEUS device has obtained CE mark approval but has not yet been fully commercialized. This limited commercial experience makes it difficult to evaluate our business, predict our future results or forecast our financial performance and growth. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties we face, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to circumstances in our business or our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nWe have formed, and may in the future form or seek, strategic alliances and collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances, collaborations or licensing arrangements.\nIn April 2016, we entered into a Collaborative Research Agreement with GE Healthcare, under which GE Healthcare has agreed to support our efforts to commercialize our TAEUS technology for use in an NAFLD application by, among other things, providing equipment and technical advice, and facilitating introductions to GE Healthcare clinical ultrasound customers. This agreement does not commit GE Healthcare to a long-term relationship and it may disengage with us at any time. This agreement has a term lasting until December 16, 2022 and is subject to termination by either party upon not less than 60 days\u2019 notice. See the section of this Annual Report titled \u201cCollaboration with GE Healthcare\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d for further description of this agreement.\nWe intend in the future to form or seek additional strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our technologies and applications.\nAny of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, restrict our ability to collaborate with other third parties or otherwise disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. If we license technologies or applications, we may not be able to realize the intended benefit of such transactions. Further, strategic alliances and collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\n\u00b7\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our technologies and applications or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon the development of an application, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of an application for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our applications and technologies;\n\u00b7\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more applications may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u00b7\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our technologies and applications, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u00b7\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable applications or technologies; and\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nAs a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our applications or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our applications could delay the development and commercialization of our technologies and applications in certain geographies or for certain applications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited resources and depend on third parties to design and manufacture, and seek regulatory approval of, our TAEUS applications. If any third party fails to successfully design, manufacture or obtain regulatory approval of TAEUS applications, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to design or manufacture our TAEUS applications. To support our design and manufacturing efforts, we have contracted StarFish Product Engineering, Inc., a medical device contract manufacturing company, rather than design or manufacture our TAEUS applications ourselves. We have limited control over the efforts and resources that these and any other third-party OEMs will devote to developing and manufacturing our TAEUS applications and their capabilities to serve our needs, including quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. In addition, we currently expect to depend on OEMs to acquire CE marks for the device or devices that they develop and manufacture which are necessary to permit marketing of those devices in the European Union followed by corresponding FDA approval.\nAn OEM may not be able to successfully design and manufacture the products it develops based on our TAEUS technology, may not devote sufficient time and resources to support these efforts or may fail in gaining the required regulatory approvals of our TAEUS applications. The failure by an OEM to perform in accordance with our expectations would substantially harm the value of our TAEUS technology, brand and business.\nWe will need to develop marketing and distribution capabilities both internally and through our relationships with third parties in order to sell any of our TAEUS products receiving regulatory approval. If we experience problems in developing these capabilities, our ability to sell our products could be limited.\nWe have limited experience selling our products and will need to develop marketing, sales and distribution capabilities in order to sell our TAEUS applications that receive the necessary regulatory approval. We have limited experience managing a sales force and customer support operations and may be unable to attract, retain and manage the collaborative manufacturing and distribution arrangements or the specialized workforce necessary to successfully commercialize our products. In addition, our sales and marketing organization must effectively explain the uses and benefits of our products as compared to alternatives in order to promote market acceptance and demand for our products. Although we have begun to hire a small internal sales and marketing team to engage and support channel partners and clinical customers, further developing these functions will be time consuming and expensive and our efforts may not be successful.\nWe intend to partner with others to assist us with some or all of these functions. However, we may be unable to find appropriate third parties with which to enter into these arrangements and any such third parties may not perform as expected.\nFurthermore, third-party distributors that are in the business of selling other medical products may not devote a sufficient level of resources and support required to generate awareness of our TAEUS applications and grow or maintain product sales. If these distributors are unwilling or unable to market and sell our products, or if they do not perform to our expectations, we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance and sales of our products. In addition, disagreements with our distributors or non-performance by these third parties could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation or arbitration and disrupt distribution channels for a period of time and require us to re-establish a distribution channel.\nIf we are unable to manage the growth of our business, our future revenues and operating results may be harmed.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand our activities, there will be additional demands on these resources. The failure to continually upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including issues relating to our research and development activities and retention of experienced scientists, managers and technicians, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan. If we are unable to implement these actions in a timely manner, our results may be adversely affected.\nCompetition in the medical imaging market is intense and we may be unable to successfully compete.\nIn general, competition in the medical imaging market is very significant and characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Competitors in this market include very large companies with significantly greater resources than we have. To successfully compete in this market we will need to develop TAEUS applications that offer significant advantages over alternative imaging products and procedures for such applications.\nWhile we believe the technology behind our TAEUS platform is unique in the industry, developments by other medical imaging companies of new or improved products, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. Alternative medical imaging devices may be more accepted or cost-effective than our products. Competition from these companies for employees with experience in the medical imaging industry could result in higher turnover of our employees. If we are unable to respond to these competitive pressures, we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products, higher expenses and lower revenue. If we are unable to compete effectively with current or new entrants to these markets, we will be unable to generate sufficient revenue to maintain our business.\nChanges in the healthcare industry could result in a reduction in the size of the market for our products or may require us to decrease the selling price for our products, either of which could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nTrends toward managed care, healthcare cost containment, and other changes in government and private sector initiatives in Europe, the United States and China are placing increased emphasis on lowering the cost of medical services, which could adversely affect the demand for or the prices of our products. For example:\n\u00b7\nmajor third-party payors of hospital and non-hospital based healthcare services could revise their payment methodologies and impose stricter standards for reimbursement of imaging procedures charges and/or a lower or more bundled reimbursement;\n\u00b7\nthere has been a consolidation among healthcare facilities and purchasers of medical devices who prefer to limit the number of suppliers from whom they purchase medical products, and these entities may decide to stop purchasing our products or demand discounts on our prices;\n\u00b7\nthere is economic pressure to contain healthcare costs in markets throughout the world; and\n\u00b7\nthere are proposed and existing laws and regulations in international and domestic markets regulating pricing and profitability of companies in the healthcare industry.\nThese trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the demand for our products in any given market that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, which could harm our business.\nWe intend to market our approved TAEUS applications globally, and are therefore subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nBecause we intend to market our approved TAEUS applications globally, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business globally. Accordingly, our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition;\n\u00b7\nlocal outbreaks of sickness or disease, including COVID-19;\n\u00b7\nwar or terrorist attack, including cyberterrorism;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in laws and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ninadequate intellectual property protection in certain countries;\n\u00b7\ntrade-protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;\n\u00b7\neffects of applicable local tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7\nsignificant adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.\nOur success largely depends upon the continued services of our executive management team and key employees. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could harm us and directly impact our financial results. Our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time. Our executive management team has significant experience and knowledge of medical devices and ultrasound systems, and the loss of any team member could impair our ability to design, identify, and develop new intellectual property and new scientific or product ideas. Additionally, if we lose the services of any of these persons, we would likely be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of replacements, which may result in a delay in the implementation of our business plan and plan of operations. We can give no assurance that we could find satisfactory replacements for these individuals on terms that would not be unduly expensive or burdensome to us.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing medical devices. In addition, we will need to identify and hire sales executives and competition for commercial and marketing talent is significant. We may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud, misconduct or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and negligent conduct that fails to: comply with the FD&C Act and similar laws of other countries, or the rules and regulations of the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies; provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies; comply with manufacturing standards we establish; comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; or report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. For any products for which we obtain regulatory approval and begin commercializing in Europe, China or the United States, respectively, our potential exposure under such laws will increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commissions, certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nMisdiagnosis, warranty and other claims, as well as product field actions and regulatory proceedings, initiated against us could increase our costs, delay or reduce our sales and damage our reputation, adversely affecting our financial condition.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of malpractice, warranty or product liability claims inherent in the sale and support of medical device products, including those based on claims that the use or failure of one of our products resulted in a misdiagnosis or harm to a patient. Such claims may cause financial loss, damage our reputation by raising questions about our products\u2019 safety and efficacy, adversely affect regulatory approvals and interfere with our efforts to market our products. Although to date we have not been involved in any medical malpractice or product liability litigation, we may incur significant liability if such litigation were to occur. We may also face adverse publicity resulting from product field actions or regulatory proceedings brought against us. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability or related claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit distribution of our products. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and negative media attention;\n\u00b7\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize a product at all or for particular applications; and\n\u00b7\na decline in the price of our securities.\nAlthough we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts we believe are commercially reasonable, any liability we incur may exceed our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies may also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a claim for which we have no coverage. Liability insurance is expensive and may cease to be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A malpractice, warranty, product liability or other claim or product field action not covered by our insurance or exceeding our coverage could significantly impair our financial condition. In addition, a product field action or a liability claim against us could significantly harm our reputation and make it more difficult to obtain the funding and commercial relationships necessary to maintain our business.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by third-party manufacturers or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our future manufacturers and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our research and development programs and our business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our products could be delayed.\nThe United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business and operations.\nThe United Kingdom exited from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the European Union entered into a trade and cooperation agreement (the \u201cTrade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d), which was applied on a provisional basis from January 1, 2021. While the economic integration does not reach the level that existed during the time the U.K. was a member state of the European Union, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement sets out preferential arrangements in areas such as trade in goods and in services, digital trade and intellectual property. Negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union are expected to continue in relation to the relationship between the U.K. and the European Union in certain other areas which are not covered by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The long term effects of Brexit will depend on the effects of the implementation and application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and any other relevant agreements between the U.K. and the European Union. It is still unclear what terms, if any, may be agreed within the U.K. and between the U.K. and other countries on many aspects of fiscal policy, cross-border trade and international relations, both in the final outcome and for any transitional period. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union could potentially disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the European Union, including in Ireland where we have significant manufacturing operations, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the European Union or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Because this is an unprecedented event, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade and legal implications Brexit would have and how it would affect the regulation applicable to our business globally and in the region. Any of these developments, along with any political, economic and regulatory changes that may occur, could cause political and economic uncertainty in Europe and internationally and harm our business and financial results. Although we have not observed a material financial impact or identified any trends or potential changes to critical accounting estimates as a result of Brexit at this time, we will continue to assess the impact of Brexit on our business and operations. The effects of Brexit and the application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement could adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Other Legal Matters\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, which entails significant expense and resources, then our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nMuch of our value arises out of our proprietary technology and intellectual property for the design, manufacture and use of medical imaging systems, including development of our TAEUS applications. We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws to protect our proprietary technology and limit the ability of others to compete with us using the same or similar technology. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, which could harm our business.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we maintain a patent portfolio consisting of twenty-three (23) patents issued in the United States and sixteen (16) issued patents in foreign jurisdictions, fourteen (14) patent applications pending in the United States and thirty-four (34) patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions relating to our technology. These patents and patent applications mostly cover certain innovations relating to fat imaging, fat quantitation, and temperature monitoring in the liver and other tissues.\nEach of our utility patents generally has a term of 20 years from its respective priority (earliest filing) date. Design patents have a term of 14 years from a respective filing date. Among our issued utility patents in the U.S., the first patent is set to expire in 2033 and the last patent is set to expire in 2041.\nExpenses related to a patent portfolio include periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which a failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and we might be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, costly and time-intensive. We may fail to stop or prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Proceedings to enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. If we cannot prevent other companies from using our proprietary technology or if our patents are found invalid or otherwise unenforceable, we may be unable to compete effectively against other manufacturers of ultrasound systems, which could decrease our market share. In addition, the breach of a patent licensing agreement by us may result in termination of a patent license.\nWe may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors or former or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to our patent activities, we rely upon, among other things, unpatented proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets and know-how. Any involuntary disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, potentially eroding our competitive position in our market. We seek to protect confidential or proprietary information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. While we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that this know-how, information and technology will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. These agreements may be terminated or breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such termination or breach. Furthermore, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. To the extent that any of our staff was previously employed by other pharmaceutical, medical technology or biotechnology companies, those employers may allege violations of trade secrets and other similar claims in relation to their former employee\u2019s therapeutic development activities for us.\nWe may in the future be a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our TAEUS applications.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications or trademarks controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products, or that we may be accused of misappropriating third parties\u2019 trade secrets. Other medical imaging market participants, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios, trade secrets, trademarks, and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents or trademarks that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, sell and/or export our products or to use product names. We may become a party to patent or trademark infringement or trade secret claims and litigation as a result of these and other third party intellectual property rights being asserted against us. The defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming. Vendors from whom we purchase hardware or software may not indemnify us in the event that such hardware or software is accused of infringing a third party\u2019s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third party\u2019s trade secret.\nFurther, if such patents, trademarks, or trade secrets are successfully asserted against us, this may harm our business and result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products, license fees, damages and the payment of attorney fees and court costs. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade secrets, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties. Although patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our TAEUS applications to avoid infringement.\nSimilarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as re-examination, inter partes review, or opposition proceedings, before the USPTO or other jurisdictional body relating to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our TAEUS applications or using product names, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents or trademarks, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. We may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling products that are the same or similar to our products or from using product names that are the same or similar to our product names, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. Should such challenges be successful, competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to ours. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad, which could affect our ability to expand to international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology. To the extent our intellectual property protection is incomplete, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. In addition, competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or design around our protected technology. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our TAEUS platform, brand and business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is or in the future may be subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, adverse publicity, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions and administrative actions. If any governmental sanctions, fines or penalties are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management's attention and our resources and substantial costs. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our TAEUS applications, or if clearances or approvals for future applications and indications are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations will be harmed.\nThe medical devices that we manufacture and market will be subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the EMA, FDA and other comparable regulatory agencies. Additionally, third parties designing, manufacturing or conducting human studies of our devices will be subject to local regulations, such as those of Health Canada. These agencies and regulations require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, based on the risk level of the device. Governmental regulations specific to medical devices are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u00b7\nproduct design, development and manufacture;\n\u00b7\nlaboratory, pre-clinical and clinical testing, labeling, packaging storage and distribution;\n\u00b7\npremarketing clearance or approval;\n\u00b7\nrecord keeping;\n\u00b7\nproduct marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution; and\n\u00b7\npost-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals.\nThe European Union has revised its regulatory system for medical devices by implementing regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (\u201cMedical Device Regulation\u201d or \u201cMDR\u201d) and regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The MDR was originally meant to apply as from May 26, 2020 (the \u201cDate of Application\u201d or \u201cDoA\u201d) but, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Date of Application was postponed to May 26, 2021. The changes to the regulatory system implemented by the MDR include stricter requirements for clinical evidence and pre-market assessment of safety and performance, refined classifications to indicate risk levels, requirements for third party testing by Notified Bodies, tightened and streamlined quality management system assessment procedures and additional requirements for the quality management system, additional requirements for traceability of products and transparency as well a refined responsibility of economic operators.\nWe are currently in a transitional period, where our products will be required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and with the Medical Device Regulation and to obtain CE mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. It is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Devices Directives or the MDR, as the case may be. CE mark approvals issued prior to the DoA will remain in place for the duration of such approvals or conformity assessments and such products may be made available for this transitional period, but no later than June 2024. In March 2020, we received CE mark approval for our TAEUS FLIP (Fatty Liver Imaging Probe) System. The CE marking indicates that TAEUS FLIP System complies with all applicable European Directives and Regulations in the European Union, including the MDR, and other CE mark geographies, including the 27 EU member states. We believe that future TAEUS applications will qualify for sale in the European Union as Class IIa medical devices. Although existing regulations do not require clinical trials to obtain CE marks for Class IIa medical devices, the MDR requires a clinical evaluation for all medical devices and clinical trials for selected medical devices. Depending on the classification of our applications, future CE mark certifications or recertification of our applications may require additional clinical evaluations or trials, as the case may be.\nWe are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products, such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the FDA and the China Food and Drug Administration before we can launch new products in the United States and China, respectively.\nInternational sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved by the FDA for use in the United States, or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the United States due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first.\nBefore a new medical device or a new intended use for an existing product can be marketed in the United States, a company must first submit and receive either 510(k) clearance or premarketing approval, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies.\nOur NAFLD TAEUS device will be reviewed under a \u201cde novo\u201d process for a risk-based classification determination whether the device is of low to moderate risk and that it can be appropriately regulated as a Class II device and thereby eligible for 510(k) clearance. While the 510(k) pathway for product marketing requires only non-clinical testing proof of substantial equivalence to a lawfully marketed predicate device for a given indication, a de novo review may require clinical studies to support a reclassification to a lower risk class. Even with the clinical data we expect to provide with the de novo submission for our NAFLD TAEUS device, the FDA may decide to reject the request to classify the device into Class II. If that happens, the device will be regulated as a Class III device and the device sponsor must fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements. Thus, although at this time we do not anticipate that we will be required to do so, it is possible that our NAFLD TAEUS device may require approval by means of a PMA.\nWe may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so, which could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the product, which may limit the market for the product. Therefore, even if we believe we have successfully developed our TAEUS technology, we may not be permitted to market TAEUS applications in the United States if we do not obtain FDA regulatory clearance to market such applications. Delays in obtaining clearance or approval could increase our costs and harm our revenues and growth.\nIn addition, we are required to timely file various reports with the FDA, including reports required by the medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to certain regulatory authorities if our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If these reports are not filed timely, regulators may impose sanctions and sales of our products may suffer, and we may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our business.\nIf we initiate a correction or removal for one of our devices to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, we would be required to submit a publicly available Correction and Removal report to the FDA and, in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device recall which could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our devices. Furthermore, the submission of these reports has been and could be used by competitors against us in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders and would harm our reputation.\nThe FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our planned products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. If the FDA or FTC determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including warning letters, and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions.\nThe FDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u00b7\nadverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u00b7\nrepair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;\n\u00b7\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u00b7\nrefusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u00b7\ncriminal prosecution.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our business and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur TAEUS applications may require recertification or new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals and we may be required to recall or cease marketing our TAEUS applications until such recertification or clearances are obtained.\nMost countries outside of the United States require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.\nIn the United States, material modifications to the intended use or technological characteristics of our TAEUS applications will require new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. Based on FDA published guidelines, the FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance; however, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision. Any modification to an FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket approval.\nWe may not be able to obtain recertification or additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for our applications or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our TAEUS technology in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining required future governmental approvals would harm our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth. If foreign regulatory authorities or the FDA require additional approvals, we may be required to recall and to stop selling or marketing our TAEUS applications, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our applications. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nIf any OEMs fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations or other regulatory bodies\u2019 equivalent regulations, manufacturing operations could be delayed or shut down and the development of our TAEUS platform could suffer.\nThe manufacturing processes of OEMs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations and other regulatory bodies\u2019 equivalent regulations, which cover the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our TAEUS applications. They may also be subject to similar state requirements and licenses and engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and make available their manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If any OEM fails such an inspection, our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse inspection could result in, among other things, a shut-down of our manufacturing operations, significant fines, suspension of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, these OEMs may be engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which would expose our OEMs to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may also affect the regulatory clearance of a third-party manufacturers\u2019 facility. If the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products, or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would impede or delay our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products, if approved. Additionally, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our product and cause our results of operations to suffer.\nOur TAEUS applications may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation.\nGovernmental authorities in Europe, the United States and China have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects. Recalls of our TAEUS applications would divert managerial attention, be expensive, harm our reputation with customers and harm our financial condition and results of operations. A recall announcement would negatively affect the price of our securities.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our planned products' commercial success.\nThere have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could harm our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers. In the EU, the Medical Devices Directive is being replaced with the more expansive Medical Devices Regulation, which may increase the costs of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals for our products. We cannot predict what other healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented by EU member countries, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us.\nIn the United States, federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), was enacted in 2010. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes an excise tax of 2.3% on the sale of most medical devices, including ours, and any failure to pay this amount could result in the imposition of an injunction on the sale of our products, fines and penalties.\nIt remains unclear whether changes will be made to the Affordable Care Act, or whether it will be repealed or materially modified. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 modified certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act and the Biden Administration and U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as may be further amended or discontinued in the future, will not harm our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may harm:\n\u00b7\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of capital.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEven though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Other jurisdictions such as the European Union have similar laws. The regulations that will affect how we operate include:\n\u00b7\nthe federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government;\n\u00b7\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nThe Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and similar foreign healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.\nOur research and development and manufacturing operations may involve the use of hazardous substances and are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous substances and the sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous substances. In addition, our research and development and manufacturing operations produce biological waste materials, such as human and animal tissue, and waste solvents, such as isopropyl alcohol. These operations are permitted by regulatory authorities, and the resultant waste materials are disposed of in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Liability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and non-compliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, personal injury and third part property damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment failure or other causes. The expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Securities, Our Financial Results and Our Need for Financing\nOur quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in volatility in the price of our securities.\nOur operating results will be affected by numerous factors such as:\n\u00b7\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our proposed products;\n\u00b7\nstatus of our product development efforts;\n\u00b7\nexecution of collaborative, licensing or other arrangements, and the timing of payments received or made under those arrangements;\n\u00b7\nintellectual property prosecution and any infringement lawsuits to which we may become a party;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments affecting our products or those of our competitors, including the timing and success of obtaining various regulatory approvals for our products\u2019 testing, production and marketing;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and maintain FDA clearance and approval from foreign regulatory authorities for our products, which have not yet been approved for marketing;\n\u00b7\nmarket acceptance of our TAEUS applications;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of reimbursement for our TAEUS applications;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract new customers and grow our business with existing customers;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and success of new product and feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of costs and expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe hiring, training and retention of key employees, including our ability to expand our sales team;\n\u00b7\nlitigation or other claims against us;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional financing; and\n\u00b7\nadvances and trends in new technologies and industry standards.\nAny or all of these factors could adversely affect our cash position requiring us to raise additional capital which may be on unfavorable terms and result in substantial dilution. Additionally, the risks surrounding our business, as well as the limited market for our common stock, have resulted, and will likely continue to result, in volatility in the price of our common stock and warrants.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future for reasons unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. From January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, intra-day trading prices on the Nasdaq Capital Market fluctuated from a low of $0.72 to a high of $3.10 with respect to shares of our common stock, and from a low of $0.06 to a high of $0.97 with respect to our warrants, and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for healthcare companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.\nAdditionally, recently, securities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to a sudden increase in demand for stock resulting in aggregate short positions in the stock exceeding the number of shares available for purchase, forcing investors with short exposure to pay a premium to repurchase shares for delivery to share lenders. This is known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d These short squeezes have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share declines steadily as interest in those stocks abates. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that they will not be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to an increased incidence of securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nThere is a limited market for our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the volume of trading has historically been limited. Our average daily trading volume of our shares from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 was approximately 1,168,925 shares. Thinly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in a more active public market. While we have made efforts to increase trading in our stock, we cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Therefore, a holder of our common stock who wishes to sell his or her shares may not be able to do so immediately or at an acceptable price.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion about our business, the price of our securities and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no or few analysts commence research coverage of us, or one or more of the analysts who cover us issues an adverse opinion about our company, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases research coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of our securities or trading volume to decline.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, including by remediating current material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decrease.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting.\nCurrently, we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and, as a result, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. Specifically, we have insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting. We are in the process of improving our internal control over financial reporting, which process is time-consuming, costly and complicated and could limit our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.\nUntil such time as we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or a smaller reporting company, our auditors will not be required to attest as to our internal control over financial reporting. If we continue to identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or, if required, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We could also become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation as well as investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, trading suspensions or other remedies.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the price of our securities may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2022, the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our May 2017 initial public offering, although we will lose that status sooner if our annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends.\nWe plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to further develop our technology and potential products and to cover operating costs. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we will, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of being a public company that reports to the SEC and our management is required to devote substantial time to meet compliance obligations.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses relating to our compliance obligations. We are subject to reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq that impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. In addition, there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Protection Act that contribute to our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Furthermore, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plan, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the price of our securities to fall.\nWe expect that significant capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise capital by issuing common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nCertain provisions of our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and Amended and Restated Bylaws (our \u201cBylaws\u201d) and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws:\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u00b7\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights;\n\u00b7\nprovide that all vacancies in our board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u00b7\nprovide that stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for director;\n\u00b7\nprovide that stockholders may only amend our Certificate of Incorporation upon a supermajority vote of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nprovide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal claims.\nIn addition, section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law limits our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following any such person\u2019s share acquisition. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16793, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "NDRA"}
