{"cik": "1501585", "company": "HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. We seek to identify, manage, and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. You should consider the following factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S. Government, for substantially all of our business, and changes affecting this customer's priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business consists primarily of the design, construction, repair, and maintenance of nuclear-powered ships, such as aircraft carriers and submarines, and non-nuclear ships, such as surface combatants and expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships, for the U.S. Navy and coastal defense surface ships for the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclear-powered ships for the U.S. Navy. Most of our revenues in 2015 were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the U.S. Government, and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. In addition, most of our backlog was U.S. Government related as of December 31, 2015. Our U.S. Government contracts are subject to various risks, including our customers' political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in customers' short-range and long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, significant changes in contract scheduling, intense contract and funding competition, difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work, delays in the timing of contract approval, and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal or regulatory requirements. Any of these factors could affect our ability to do business with the U.S. Government, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs, changes in customer priorities, and potential contract terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are directly dependent upon congressional allocation of defense funds to the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For certain programs, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be performed over several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often partially funded initially and receive additional funding only as Congress makes additional appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included, increased, or reduced as part of the annual budget process, in continuing resolutions, or in individual supplemental appropriations.\nThe impact of Congressional actions to reduce the federal debt and resulting pressures on federal spending could adversely affect the total funding of individual ships or funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (the \"BCA\") reduced the DoD top-line budget by $487 billion from fiscal years 2012 through 2021, representing approximately 8% of planned defense spending. Additionally, because Congress did not identify savings to reduce the U.S. deficit by up to $1.2 trillion prior to March 1, 2013, budgetary sequestration was implemented under the BCA. Sequestration requires an additional reduction from fiscal years 2012 through 2021 of $500 billion for defense spending, representing approximately 9% of planned defense spending, and $500 billion for non-defense discretionary spending, including the U.S. Coast Guard.\nOn December 26, 2013, the President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (the \"BBA 2013\"), which provided $63 billion in sequestration relief over two years, split evenly between defense and non-defense programs, and set overall discretionary spending at $1.012 trillion and $1.013 trillion for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively. On November 2, 2015, the President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the \"BBA 2015\"), which provided $80 billion in sequestration relief over two years, split evenly between defense and non-defense programs. The BBA 2015 provided sequestration relief of $50 billion and $30 billion for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively, resulting in overall discretionary spending caps of $1.067 trillion and $1.070 trillion for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. Sequestration remains in effect under the BCA for fiscal years 2018 through\n2021. Enactment of the BBA 2015 enabled the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to agree upon final appropriations levels and enabled final passage and enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which provided general spending for most of the U.S. federal government, including the DoD, DoE, and the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 specifically provided funding for construction of CVN-79 John F. Kennedy, advance procurement funding for CVN-80 Enterprise, construction of two SSN-774 Virginia-class submarines, procurement for the CVN-73 USS George Washington RCOH, advance procurement for the CVN-74 USS John C. Stennis RCOH, continuation of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer production, advance procurement for LHA-8 (unnamed), procurement of an additional LPD-17 San Antonio-class warship, advance procurement to accelerate the LXR program, research, development, test, and evaluation (\u201cRDT&E\u201d) funding for the Ohio replacement program, procurement of a T-AO(X) fleet oiler, and procurement of an additional NSC for the U.S. Coast Guard.\nWhile the BBA 2015 eliminated the implementation of sequestration reductions for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, uncertainty continues regarding the specific effects of sequestration in fiscal years 2018 through 2021, and related funding reductions that could result in the cancellation of or decreased funding for our existing programs and/or a lack of funding for future programs.\nThe impact of the continuing federal fiscal debates for fiscal year 2017 and beyond remains uncertain, and we cannot predict the impact that the sequestration cuts or other defense spending cuts may have on funding for our individual programs. Long-term funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced, delayed, or canceled. In addition, defense spending cuts and delays could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors and employee base. Our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding. Significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the U.S. Navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe budget environment, including sequestration as currently mandated, remains a significant long-term risk. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry. We believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country, the defense industrial base, including us, and the customers, employees, suppliers, subcontractors, investors, and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base. Although it is difficult to determine specific impacts, we expect that over the longer term, the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues, profits, and cash flows from our U.S. Government contracts. Congress continues to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning, but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts. It is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have long-term impacts on us and the entire defense industry.\nDemand for our products and services can also be affected by potential changes in customer priorities due to changes in military strategy and planning. In response to the need for cheaper alternatives and the proliferation of \"smart weapons,\" future strategy reassessments by the DoD may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding programs, including our aircraft carrier programs. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our aircraft carrier programs accounted for approximately 35% of our consolidated revenue. We cannot predict the impact of changes in customer priorities on existing, follow-on, replacement, or future programs. A shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little to no prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for the U.S. Government's convenience, contractors are normally protected by provisions covering reimbursement of costs already incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program. Termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities, including excess re-procurement costs, and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts. Any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCost growth on fixed price and other contracts that cannot be justified as increases in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and to the potential loss of future business.\nOur operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers. Cost growth can occur if expenses to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges, manufacturing difficulties, delays, workforce-related issues, or inaccurate initial estimates used for calculating contract costs. Reasons may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work performed, the timeliness and availability of materials, major subcontractor performance or product quality issues, performance delays, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and natural disasters. The process of estimating contract costs requires significant judgment and expertise. A significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur ability to recover the costs we incur and realize profits on contracts with our U.S. Government customers depends on the type of contract under which we are performing. Our U.S. Government business is currently performed under firm fixed price (\"FFP\"), fixed price incentive (\"FPI\"), cost plus incentive fee (\"CPIF\"), cost plus fixed fee (\"CPFF\"), and cost plus award fee (\"CPAF\") contracts. Under FFP contracts, we retain all cost savings on completed contracts but are responsible for the full amount of all expenditures in excess of the contract price. FPI contracts, on the other hand, are flexibly priced agreements under which cost overruns and underruns to an agreed target cost are shared between the U.S. Government and us. The U.S. Government is liable for its share of allowable costs up to a ceiling price, and we are responsible for all costs incurred in excess of such ceiling price, typically 125-135% of target cost. Our profit on FPI contracts varies according to a formula set forth in the contract that generally compares the amount of costs incurred to the contract target cost. Under CPIF, CPFF and CPAF contracts, we are generally required to perform the contract only to the extent the U.S. Government makes funds available, and we recover all allowable costs incurred in the performance of the contract. Under CPIF contracts, our profit is determined by a contractually specified formula that compares allowable incurred costs to the contract target cost, subject in some instances to a maximum or minimum fee percentage. Under CPFF contracts, the dollar amount of profit received is the same without regard to the amount of costs incurred. Under CPAF contracts, the dollar amount of profit received is determined by the award fee provisions in the contract.\nOf Ingalls' revenues in 2015, approximately 89% were generated from FPI contracts, approximately 4% were generated from FFP contracts, approximately 4% were generated from CPFF contracts, and approximately 3% were generated from CPAF contracts. Of Newport News' 2015 revenues, approximately 33% were generated from FPI contracts, consisting primarily of submarine construction contracts, approximately 32% were generated from CPFF contracts, approximately 31% were generated from CPIF contracts, consisting primarily of aircraft carrier construction and RCOH contracts, approximately 3% were generated from FFP contracts, and approximately 1% were generated from CPAF contracts. Substantially all of our Other segment's 2015 revenues were generated from FFP contracts. To the extent our mix of contract types change in the future, our ability to recover our costs and realize profits on our contracts can be negatively affected.\nOur earnings and profitability depend upon our ability to perform under contracts.\nWhen agreeing to contract terms, we make assumptions and projections about future conditions and events, many of which extend over long periods. Our assumptions and projections are based upon our assessments of the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, and the timing of product deliveries. We may experience significant variances from our assumptions and projections, delays in our contract performance, and variances in the timing of our product deliveries. If our actual experience differs significantly from one or more of our assumptions or projections, or, if we incur unanticipated contract costs, the profitability of the related contracts may be adversely affected.\nOur earnings and profitability depend, in part, upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing.\nWe rely on other companies to provide raw materials, major components, and sub-systems for our products, and we rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and sub-assemblies and perform certain services that we provide to our customers. We are subject to potential delivery disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely\naffected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreed-upon products or materials or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nOur costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts. We may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our U.S. Government contracts, to the extent that such increases are consistent with industry indices. Even with these provisions, however, the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty. In addition, significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials, which may occur as a result of availability or price, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are required to procure certain raw materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. As a result of consolidation in the defense industry, only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products. The inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component in a timely or cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nChanges to Department of Defense business practices could have a material effect on DoD's procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards.\nThe defense industry has implemented, and we expect will continue to implement, significant changes to business practices resulting from, among other causes, an increased focus by DoD on affordability, efficiencies, recovery of costs, and a reprioritization of available defense funds to key areas for future defense spending. The DoD continues to adjust its procurement practices, requirements criteria, and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs, gain efficiencies and enhance program management and control. In addition, the DCMA and DCAA have implemented cost recovery/cost savings initiatives to prioritize efforts to recover costs. As a result of certain of these initiatives, we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits and/or lengthened periods of time required to close open audits. In addition, the thresholds for certain allowable costs, including compensation costs, have been significantly reduced, and other thresholds are being challenged, debated, and, in certain cases, modified. Significant changes to the thresholds for allowable costs could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn September 2014, the DoD initiated Better Buying Power 3.0 (\"BBP 3.0\") to address its growing concern that the United States' technological superiority over potential adversaries is being threatened. BBP 3.0 includes eight focus areas: achieve affordable programs; achieve dominant capabilities while controlling life cycle costs; incentivize productivity in industry and government; incentivize innovation in industry and government; eliminate unproductive processes and bureaucracy; promote effective competition; improve tradecraft in acquisition of services; and improve the professionalism of the total acquisition workforce. While some of the larger objectives remained the same as those in Better Buying Power 2.0, their focus has narrowed and the circle of stakeholders has expanded.\nWe expect DoD's focus on business practices to impact the contracting environment in which we operate as we and others in the industry adjust our practices to address the new initiatives and the reduced level of spending by the DoD. We are assessing internally how we can respond to and support these changes, including how we can further reduce costs and increase productivity, modify how we respond to acquisition proposals, and revise our areas of focus. Depending on how these initiatives are implemented, they could have an impact on our current programs, as well as new business opportunities with the DoD.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost, requiring us to develop and maintain technologies, facilities, equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers.\nShipbuilding is a long cycle business, and our success depends on quality, cost, and schedule performance on our contracts. We must develop and maintain the workforce, technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver our products and services at an affordable life cycle cost. If we fail to maintain our competitive position in these areas, we could lose future contracts to our competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain at competitive costs a sufficient number of engineers and workers with the necessary skills and/or security clearances. At the same time, stable future revenues and costs are important for us to maintain a qualified workforce. Development and maintenance of the necessary nuclear expertise and the challenges of hiring and training a qualified workforce can be a limitation on our business. If qualified personnel become scarce, we could experience higher labor, recruiting, or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees, or, if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, we could incur difficulties in performing our contracts and attracting new contract awards.\nCompetition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share.\nU.S. defense spending levels are uncertain and difficult to predict. The reduction in shipbuilding activity by the U.S. Navy, as evidenced by the reduction in fleet size from 566 ships in 1989 to 272 ships as of December 31, 2015, has resulted in workforce reductions in the industry but little infrastructure consolidation. The general result has been fewer contracts awarded to the same fixed number of shipyards. Six major private United States shipyards, three of which we own, plus numerous other smaller private shipyards compete for contracts to construct, overhaul, repair, and convert naval vessels. Additionally, our products, such as aircraft carriers, submarines, amphibious assault ships, surface combatants, and other ships, compete for funding with each other, as well as with other defense products and services. We expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to be intense.\nWe compete with another large defense contractor for construction contracts to build surface combatants and submarines, and we are currently engaged in a competition to build either the next amphibious assault ship (LHA-8) or six fleet oilers (T-AO(X)). We may in the future compete with the same and other defense contractors to build other ships for which we are currently the sole source, including expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships. Moreover, reductions in U.S. defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our risk exposure to market competition. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, we may experience declines in revenues and market share, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAlthough we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, two existing U.S. Government-owned shipyards may be able to refuel nuclear-powered aircraft carriers if substantial investments in facilities, personnel, and training were made. U.S. Government-owned shipyards engage in the refueling, overhaul, and inactivation of SSN-688 Los Angeles-class submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling non-nuclear ships. The 2012 National Defense Authorization Act required DoD to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers. The 2013 Defense Authorization Act, however, modified the 2012 Act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance. The 2013 Act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier, as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier. Similarly, the 2013 Act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was contained in previous law. If a U.S. Government-owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe also compete in the shipbuilding engineering, planning, and design market with other companies that provide engineering support services. Such competition increases the risk that we may not be the successful bidder on future U.S. Navy engineering proposals, including aircraft carrier research and development, submarine design, and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts.\nOur competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. As the competitive environment intensifies, the number of bid protests may increase. Bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned, requiring a re-bid of the contract. Even when a bid protest does not result in a re-bid, resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin, which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a U.S. Government audit or investigation.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we must comply with significant regulatory requirements, including those relating to procurement, cyber security, and nuclear operations. Government contracting requirements increase our contract\nperformance and compliance costs and change on a consistent basis. In addition, our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment, which results in increased performance and compliance efforts and costs. New laws, regulations, or procurement requirements, or changes to existing ones (including, for example, regulations related to allowability of compensation costs, cyber security, counterfeit parts, specialty metals, and conflict minerals), can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its various agencies, including the U.S. Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, the DCAA, and the DCMA. These agencies review our contract performance, cost structures, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and internal policies. Systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems, purchasing systems, billing systems, property management and control systems, cost estimating systems, earned value management systems, compensation systems, and management information and cyber security systems. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, which could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory, treble, or other damages. Certain U.S. Government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges. Allegations of impropriety can also cause us significant reputational harm.\nWhether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in business systems subject to its review. The U.S. Government has, in certain instances, withheld payments on certain of our contracts upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems. When appropriate, we will modify our affected business systems to address the U.S. Government's concerns.\nThe U.S. Government has, from time to time, recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced, or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed. These recommendations sometimes involve substantial dollar amounts. In response to U.S. Government audits, investigations, and inquiries, we have also in the past made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts. Such audits, investigations, and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices. Any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if previously reimbursed.\nWe must comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations, including the FAR, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and Cost Accounting Standards, and we are subject, from time to time, to U.S. Government investigations relating to our operations. If we are convicted or otherwise found to have engaged in illegal activities, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law, we may be subject to reductions in the values of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, penalties, fines, repayments, compensatory, treble, or other damages, or suspension or debarment, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMany of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control, and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.\nWe design, develop, and manufacture products and provide services applied by our customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in product development or with delivery of subcontractor components or services as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and intellectual property rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and parts could prevent us from satisfying contractual requirements.\nFirst-in-class ships, also known as lead ships, usually have new technology that is supplied by the U.S. Navy, other contractors, or us. Problems in developing these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design schedule needed for construction. The risks associated with new technology or mid-construction design changes can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery. Late delivery of information can also cause inefficiencies in the construction process, increase costs, and put the delivery schedule at risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.\nOur products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems, including premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, substandard quality or workmanship, and unplanned degradation of product performance. These failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations by causing unanticipated expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus to respond to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the government customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received.\nWe have experienced quality issues in the past with respect to products and services that we sell to our U.S. Government customers. These issues have required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions. We may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action. Such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not recover all of our costs related to the wind down of shipbuilding at our Avondale shipyard.\nIn October 2014, we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at our Avondale, Louisiana shipyard and consolidated all Ingalls shipbuilding into our Pascagoula shipyard. In connection with and as a result of the wind down of shipbuilding at Avondale, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs and asset write-downs, which we currently estimate at $287 million. We believe that substantially all such expenses are recoverable under existing flexibly-priced contracts or future negotiated contracts in accordance with FAR provisions governing the treatment of restructuring and shutdown related costs.\nWe have engaged in communications and negotiations with the U.S. Navy since 2010 regarding the amount and recovery of our restructuring and shutdown costs. In August 2015, we received a letter from the Supervisor of Shipbuilding's Contracting Officer (\"Contracting Officer\"), with a preliminary determination that our method of allocating as indirect costs certain employee retention and incentive expenses, which could be up to $57 million, did not comply with cost accounting allocation regulations. We have responded with our basis supporting our cost allocation positions and sought a determination that supports our method of cost allocation.\nWe currently do not have an agreement with the U.S. Navy regarding the government contract accounting and pricing treatment of the restructuring and shutdown costs associated with our wind down of operations at Avondale. We may also incur environmental costs in connection with the wind down. Such costs, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time, could be significant. The actual restructuring expenses we incur in connection with our wind down of Avondale, including potential environmental costs, may be greater than our current estimate, and any inability to recover our restructuring expenses substantially in accordance with our cost recovery expectations could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nContract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. The size and nature of many of our contracts make the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables. For new shipbuilding programs, we estimate, negotiate and contract for construction of ships that are not completely designed. Assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues for these ships are subject to the variability of the final ship design and evolving scope of work. Our assumptions on ship contracts include the length of time to complete the contract, because total costs include expected increases in wages and material prices. Similarly, our assumptions include the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. We consider incentives, awards, and penalties related to contract performance in estimating revenues and profit rates, and we record them when sufficient information exists to assess anticipated contract performance.\nThe judgment and estimation processes described above are significant to our contract accounting, and materially different amounts can be generated if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions. Future changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in Item 7.\nOur business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters, environmental disasters, and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have significant operations located in regions of the United States that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes, floods, and environmental disasters, such as oil spills. The damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Natural disasters can disrupt our facilities, systems, or projects, which can interrupt operational processes and performance on our contracts. Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\nNatural disasters can disrupt our workforce, electrical and other power distribution networks, computer and internet operations and accessibility, and the critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations. These disruptions could adversely affect our contract performance and financial results. Environmental disasters, particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used for the transport and testing of our ships, can disrupt the timing of performance under our contracts with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard.\nOur suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts. Performance failures by our subcontractors due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts, which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor, the customer, or insurers. Such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts.\nIn addition to the types of events described above, operation of our facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. Such events may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\nWe seek to negotiate and enter into insurance agreements to cover our significant risks and potential liabilities, including, among others, natural disasters, product liability, and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss. In some circumstances, we may be indemnified for losses by the U.S. Government, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance, and, for insurable risks, the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of actual losses or liabilities incurred, including, for example, in the case of a catastrophic hurricane. In addition, the nature of our business makes it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact of such events. Such limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in us bearing substantial costs for uninsured losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even in cases where we have insurance coverage, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows, and, if litigation with the insurance carrier becomes necessary, an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements.\nApproximately 50% of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and two DoE site stabilization agreements. Newport News has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, which expire in July 2017, August 2018, and December 2018. Newport News craft workers employed at the Kesselring Site near Saratoga Springs, New York are represented under an indefinite DoE site agreement. Newport News will begin negotiations in early 2016 with IAM, which was recently determined to be the exclusive representative for approximately 200 Newport News radiological control, calibration, and laboratory technicians. Ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, all of which expire in March 2018. Approximately 35 SN3 craft employees at the Hanford Site near Richland, Washington are represented under an indefinite DoE site stabilization agreement.\nCollective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years, and we negotiate successor agreements as each of our collective bargaining agreements expires. While we believe we maintain good relationships with our represented workers, it is possible that we may experience difficulties renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements. We have, in the past, experienced work stoppages, strikes, and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements. If we experience such events in the future, we could incur additional expenses or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nChanges in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates and assumed long-term returns on assets, actual investment returns on our pension plan assets, and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our earnings, equity, and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in future periods.\nOur pension and retiree health care costs are dependent on significant judgment regarding various estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Differences between actual investment returns and our assumed long-term returns on assets will result in future changes in pension expense and the funded status of our plans, and could increase future funding of the plans.\nTiming differences exist among the accrual of pension costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), pension funding requirements, and the recovery of pension costs that are allowable under our government contracts. Such timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On December 27, 2011, the U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (\"CAS\") Board issued its final CAS Harmonization Rule. The rule impacted pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and was effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after February 27, 2012. Although we believe contractors are entitled to an equitable adjustment on CAS-covered contracts awarded prior to the February 27, 2012 effective date, the application of this rule could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows if we are unable to successfully recover such equitable adjustment.\nFor a complete discussion regarding how our consolidated financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies and regulatory changes, see Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in Item 7.\nUnforeseen environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to and affected by a variety of existing federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment, or natural resources. We expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations, and such costs could be substantial, depending on the future proliferation of environmental rules and regulations and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions.\nShipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials. Our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater, which we treat before discharging pursuant to various permits. To handle these materials, our shipyards have an extensive network of aboveground and underground storage tanks, some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past. In addition, our handling of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in spills in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate. Our shipyards maintain extensive waste handling programs that we periodically modify, consistent with changes in applicable laws and regulations. See Environmental, Health and Safety in Item 1.\nVarious federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation, storage, and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. Substantial fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and several \"strict liability\" for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations render a party liable for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties.\nIn addition to fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions, environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges and/or to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases. We have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, costs to comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants released into the environment. In addition, if we are found to be in violation of the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the EPA on the \"Excluded Parties List\" maintained by the General Services Administration, which would continue until the EPA concluded that the cause of the violation was cured. Facilities on the \"Excluded Parties List\" are prohibited from working on any U.S. Government contract.\nThe adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, imposition of new cleanup requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts, or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe ceased shipbuilding construction at our Avondale, Louisiana shipyard in 2014. Our wind down of operations at this shipyard may result in environmental costs, the amount of which we cannot currently estimate. Such costs could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMarket volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors and the ability of counterparties to perform on financial agreements.\nThe financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption, reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers. We may access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities, including funding acquisitions and capital expansion projects and refinancing existing indebtedness. We also access these markets to obtain credit support for our workers' compensation self-insurance program and arrange for letters of credit. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook, or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, meet contractual or financing commitments, make future investments or desirable acquisitions, or respond to competitive challenges.\nTightening credit markets could also adversely affect our suppliers' and subcontractors' ability to obtain financing. Delays in suppliers' or subcontractors' ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing, could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and cause our inability to perform our contracts. The inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors, which could result in significant incremental costs and delays.\nWe have existing agreements with counterparties in the financial markets, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, and other institutional parties, and may in the future enter into agreements with such parties. These transactions expose us to potential credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be increased when collateral held by us to secure performance of a counterparty cannot be liquidated upon a sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us under the related contract.\nOur reputation and our ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents, or business partners.\nOur compliance program includes detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls, policies, procedures, and training designed to prevent and detect misconduct by employees, agents, or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials, the protection of export controlled or classified information, cost accounting and billing, competition, and data privacy. We may not, however, prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees, agents, or business partners, and the risk of improper conduct may be expected to increase as we expand into commercial markets and foreign jurisdictions. Any improper actions by our employees, agents, or business partners could subject us to administrative, civil, or criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary penalties, including suspension or\ndebarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Any such improper actions could also cause us significant reputational harm.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security threats, and related disruptions.\nAs a defense contractor, we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including classified and other sensitive information of the U.S. Government. While we maintain stringent information security policies and protocols, we face cyber security and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, including threats to our and the U.S. Government's proprietary and classified information. We face unauthorized and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from groups of hackers, and we could also face attempts to gain physical access to classified and other sensitive information located at our facilities. Our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations. Breaches of our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities could cause us to incur significant recovery and restoration expenses; degrade performance on existing contracts; and expose us to reputational damage, potential liability, or the loss of current or future contracts, including work on sensitive or classified systems for the U.S. Government, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur nuclear operations subject us to various environmental, regulatory, financial, and other risks.\nThe design, construction, refueling and overhaul, repair, and inactivation of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines, our nuclear facilities used to support such activities, our nuclear operations at DoE sites, and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nPotential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive materials, including nuclear assemblies and their components;\n\u2022\nUnplanned expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair, including repairs required by the U.S. Navy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the DoE;\n\u2022\nReputational harm;\n\u2022\nPotential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control; and\n\u2022\nRegulatory noncompliance and loss of authorizations or indemnifications necessary for our operations.\nFailure to properly handle nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage, including environmental contamination. If a nuclear accident were to occur, its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of corrective action taken by us and emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and wind conditions. Actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs.\nOur nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, DoE, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, or shut down our operations, depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance. In addition, new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, DoE, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures.\nSubject to certain requirements and limitations, our contracts with the U.S. Navy and DoE generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations. We may not, however, be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations. To mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations, we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators. Such insurance, however, may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nChanges in future business conditions could cause business investments, recorded goodwill, and/or purchased intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nAs part of our business strategy, we acquire non-controlling and controlling interests in businesses. We make acquisitions and investments following careful analysis and due diligence processes designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. Business acquisitions generally involve estimates, assumptions and judgments in determining acquisition prices, which prices are allocated among acquired assets, including goodwill, based upon fair market values. Notwithstanding our analyses, due diligence processes and business integration efforts, actual operating results of acquired businesses may vary significantly from initial estimates. In such events, we may be required to write down our carrying value of the related goodwill and/or purchased intangible assets. In addition, declines in the trading price of our common stock or the market as a whole can result in goodwill and/or purchased intangible asset impairment charges.\nAs of December 31, 2015, goodwill and purchased intangible assets generated from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 16% and 8%, respectively, of our total assets. We evaluate goodwill values for impairment annually on November 30, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We also evaluate the values of purchased intangible assets when evidence of potential impairment exists. The impairment tests are based on several factors requiring judgment. As a general matter, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the second quarter of 2015, and the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded goodwill impairment charges at our Other segment of $16 million, $59 million, and $47 million, respectively. The Other segment, established in the second quarter of 2014 following the acquisition of UPI, is sensitive to developments in the oil and gas industry. The goodwill impairment charges were primarily driven by continuing declines in oil prices and the resulting decreases in industry market multiples. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an intangible asset impairment of $27 million at our Other segment as a result of declining market conditions and updated expectations.\nAdverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and the trading price of our common stock, or other events such as reductions in future contract awards or significant adverse changes in our operating margins or operating results of acquired businesses that vary significantly from projected results on which purchase prices are based, could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Any such impairments that result in us recording additional goodwill impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, the ultimate tax determination of many of our transactions and calculations is uncertain. In addition, timing differences in the recognition of contract income for financial statement purposes and for income tax purposes can cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax payments, which can have a significant impact on cash flow in a particular period. Changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain transactions or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in differences between financial statement income and taxable income, the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities, and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense, profitability, and cash flow.\nWe conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances. We may have limited control over such arrangements and experience returns that are not proportional to the risks and resources we contribute.\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures with business partners. In any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on major issues. We and our joint venture partners may, in certain instances, fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis, or at all. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any non-performance, default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners, and we typically share liability or have joint and/or several liability with our joint venture partners for joint venture matters. Any of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our joint venture operations and the profitability of our joint ventures.\nIn joint ventures in which we hold a minority interest, we have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture projects and internal controls relating to operations. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control reporting that apply to us. As a result, internal control issues may arise that could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture. In addition, in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners, we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture. Such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns.\nStrategic acquisitions and investments we pursue involve risks and uncertainties.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we review, evaluate, and consider potential acquisitions and investments. In evaluating such transactions, we have to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets, the risks and costs of potential liabilities, and the future prospects of business opportunities. In addition, acquisitions and investments involve other risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses, challenges achieving strategic objectives and other benefits anticipated from acquisitions or investments, the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations and other initiatives, the potential impairment of acquired assets, and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses. Our financial results, business, and future prospects could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues at acquired businesses, transaction-related charges, liabilities, amortization of expenses related to purchased intangible assets, and charges for impairment of purchased intangible assets.\nWe are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments and/or future material charges against our operating income, materially impairing our financial position or cash flows.\nThe size, nature, and complexity of our business make it highly susceptible to claims and litigation. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various administrative, civil, or criminal litigation, environmental claims, income tax matters, compliance matters, claims, and investigations, which could divert financial and management resources and result in fines, penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages, or nonmonetary relief. Government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations. Litigation, claims, or investigations, if ultimately resolved against us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Any litigation, claim, or investigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete.\nWe own certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property, and we license certain intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The U.S. Government generally holds licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property. More recently, the U.S. Government has asserted or sought to obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property associated with its contracts. The U.S. Government's efforts could result in a decrease in our ability to control the use of certain of our intellectual property rights in a government contracting environment. Our intellectual property is also subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation, or circumvention by third parties.\nWe also rely upon proprietary technology, information, processes, and know-how that are not protected by patents. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors, and other parties, as well as through other measures. These agreements and other measures may not, however, provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information.\nIn the event of infringement of our intellectual property rights, breach of a confidentiality agreement, or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our rights in our intellectual property. Litigation to determine the scope of our rights, even if successful, could be costly and a diversion of management's attention from other aspects of our business. In addition, trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. If we are unable adequately to protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have the right to use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties. In instances where third parties have licensed to us the right to use their intellectual property, we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms.\nOur debt exposes us to certain risks.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $1,273 million of debt and $1,223 million of additional borrowing capacity under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmended Credit Facility\u201d). Our current level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nIncreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nRequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nIncreasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nExposing us to the risk of higher interest rates, to the extent borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility are subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nPlacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to borrow additional funds.\nBecause we use a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations to which we are subject under our various debt arrangements. Moreover, we have significant additional borrowing capacity and may be able to incur significant additional debt in the future. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we face could be increased.\nRestrictive covenants in the indentures governing our senior notes and our Amended Credit Facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe terms of our Amended Credit Facility limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nIncur additional debt;\n\u2022\nPay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, our stock;\n\u2022\nPrepay, redeem, or repurchase certain of our debt;\n\u2022\nMake investments;\n\u2022\nConsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nIncur liens.\nThe indentures governing our two tranches of 5.000% senior notes limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nConsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nIncur liens.\nIn addition, the terms of our Amended Credit Facility require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio. These covenants may restrict our financial flexibility, limit our strategic initiatives, restrict our ability to grow, or limit our ability to respond to competitive changes. These covenants may affect how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. These covenants may, therefore, affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and operate our business.\nOur spin-off from Northrop Grumman exposes us to potential liabilities, including U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nOur spin-off from Northrop Grumman was structured to minimize the likelihood that Northrop Grumman, Northrop Grumman's stockholders, and we would be required to recognize any taxable income, gain, or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off, except with respect to cash received by Northrop Grumman's stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. If all or a portion of the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, Northrop Grumman would recognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under IRS regulations, each member of Northrop Grumman's consolidated group at the time of the spin-off, including us and our subsidiaries, would be severally liable for the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability.\nIn connection with the spin-off, Northrop Grumman and we agreed that each of us would be responsible for the debts, liabilities, and other obligations related to the respective business or businesses that we own and operate following the spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us, it is possible that a court would disregard the agreed allocation and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Northrop Grumman, such as certain tax and/or environmental liabilities, particularly if Northrop Grumman were to refuse or be unable to pay or perform its allocated obligations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, as well as regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws currently provide for a classified board of directors, require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations, and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock and us.\nOur nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the U.S. Navy. Consequently, the U.S. Navy has required us to include in our contracts with the Navy provisions regarding notice and approval rights in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and regarding the Navy's obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our nuclear work for the Navy. Such provisions require us to provide the U.S. Navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and obtain the Navy's consent for transferring certain related licenses, to facilitate the Navy's ability to ensure that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner. We have included such provisions in solicitations for future U.S. Navy nuclear work, and we expect them to be included in future contracts with the Navy for nuclear work.\nProvisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Restated Bylaws and our existing contracts with the U.S. Navy may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 12623, "SIC": 3730, "TIC": "HII"}
