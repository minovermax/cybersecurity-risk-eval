RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Relating to Ownership Structure\nThe controlling shareholder group may be able to vote its shares in favor of its interests that may not always coincide with the interests of shareholders not part of such group. This risk may be counter-balanced to a degree by the actions of the Board of Directors whose composition is made up of a majority of independent directors.\nThe controlling shareholder group includes a corporation that owns a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock and which does business with the Company, as further described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In theory, this could result in a conflict of interest; nevertheless, the Company and its largest shareholder have put in place some controls to reduce the effects of any perceived conflict of interest.\nCertain conflicts of interest may be perceived by the relationship between the Company and its largest shareholder. Both entities have the same Chief Executive Officer, and certain management personnel work for both entities. Nevertheless, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) is composed of a majority of independent directors. In 2005, in a case involving both entities, the Delaware Supreme Court in connection with an attempt to obtain books and records of the Company through a proceeding against the Company\u2019s significant shareholder, held that the actions of the Company\u2019s Board were proper.\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on Our Results and Operations\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by The World Health Organization. Throughout the United States and locally, governments and municipalities instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. By the end of March 2020, the economic impacts became significant for the remainder of the year ended July 31, 2020.\nBeginning March 2020 and continuing through July 2021, we experienced an increase in late payments due to the impact of COVID-19 and the related reductions in economic activity from government mandated business disruptions and shelter -in- place orders. The effects of COVID-19 on our tenants have been reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable. In limited circumstances, we have agreed to rent abatements and deferrals for certain tenants. We also continue to experience volatility in the valuation of our equity investments through July 31, 2021.\nLooking ahead, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business is unknown and highly unpredictable. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and historical trends in revenues, income from operations, net income, earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities, among others, may differ materially. For example, to the extent the pandemic continues to disrupt economic activity nationally and in New York, NY, like other businesses, it could adversely affect our business operations and financial results through prolonged decreases in revenue, credit deterioration of our tenants, depressed economic activity, or declines in capital markets. In addition, many of our expenses are less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues. The extent of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; distribution of vaccines; and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and related government stimulus measures.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a part of the communities in which we do business. Accordingly, like other businesses in our communities, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf the continued threat of terrorism;\n\u25cf economic downturns, both on a national and on local scales;\n\u25cf loss of key personnel;\n\u25cf the availability, if needed, of additional financing;\n\u25cf the continued availability of insurance (in different types of policies) at reasonably acceptable rates;\n\u25cf the general burdens of governmental regulation, at the Local, State and Federal levels;\n\u25cf climate change;\n\u25cf cyber security; and\n\u25cf pandemics and the ongoing effects of COVID-19.\nRisks Related to Real Estate Operations\nOur investment in property development may be limited by increasing costs required to \u201cfit up\u201d property to be leased to tenants. Also, as the cost of fitting up properties increases, we may be required to wait and forsake opportunities that would be revenue producing until such time that we obtain the necessary financing of such ventures. This risk may be mitigated by our obtaining lines of credit and other financing vehicles, although such have significant limitations on the amounts that may be borrowed at any point in time.\nWe also may be subject to environmental liability as an owner or operator of properties. Many of our properties are old and when we need to fit up a property for a new tenant, we may find materials and the like that could be deemed to contain hazardous elements requiring remediation or encapsulation.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on demand for commercial real estate rental space has been significant. As online retail operations continued to expand nationwide during the pandemic, retailers are facing increased competition which reduces the need for the leasing of properties which is our business. Professionals working remotely during the pandemic has resulted in tenants\u2019 careful evaluation of office space needs and a decline in demand of commercial office space rentals and increasing competition. The Company emphasizes retention of tenants over a long period of time which helps in difficult economic conditions. The Company also aggressively markets available space to tenants including governmental agencies, medical and educational institutions.\nWe try to lease our properties to tenants with adequate finances, but as a result of recent business downturns, even formerly financially strong tenants may be at risk. The Company mitigates risks of tenants with less than adequate finances by leasing our properties to multiple tenants where applicable in order to diversify the tenant base.\nRisks Related to our Investments\nExcess cash and cash equivalents may be invested from time to time. We seek to earn rates of return that will help us finance our business operations. These investments may be subject to significant uncertainties and may not be successful for many reasons, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u25cf worsening of general economic and market conditions; and\n\u25cf adverse legal, financial and regulatory developments that may affect a particular business.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThese are some of the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d that could affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company endeavors to take actions and do business in a way that reduces these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or, at least, takes them into account when conducting its business. Nevertheless, some of these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d cannot be avoided so that the Company must also take actions and do business that negates the adverse effects that these may have on the Company.", "PERMNO": 27617, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "MAYS"}
