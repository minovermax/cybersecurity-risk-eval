Risk Factors\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. This section provides you with cautionary statements identifying, for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. You can identify these forward-looking statements by forward-looking words such as \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cseek\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, and similar expressions.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nOur results of operations could be materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions.\nOur business is affected by global macroeconomic conditions, which at various times have included considerable uncertainty and volatility. In particular, we have experienced periods during which economic conditions have been unstable and difficult to predict globally, and during which many regions experienced volatile growth patterns or declines. In the latter part of 2018, global economic conditions slowed down, particularly in Europe, and were marked by greater volatility and uncertainty, and in some countries, such as France and Germany, declining business sentiment. This adversely affected client demand for our services and solutions, and resulted in declines or declining growth rates in many of our markets. There is a risk if these trends continue or intensify, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability is sensitive to decreases in demand. When demand drops or remains low, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, such as we experienced in some of our markets in the second half of 2018, we may not be able to reduce selling and administrative expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, during periods of decline or uncertainty, companies may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer.\nEconomic conditions in the countries and territories where we do business may be affected by recent or emerging events, such as the rise of populism, changes in ruling parties or governmental leadership, protectionism or changes in global trade policies, the global refugee crisis, changes in immigration policy, changes in employment policy, rising interest rates, the impact of terrorist activity, or by other political or economic developments. We are particularly susceptible to changes in economic conditions in Europe, which represents two of our operating segments and approximately 67% of our revenue. During 2018, various economies in Europe experienced a slowdown, and there is a risk that some or many of the European economies may be hampered by events which\nemerged in recent years, including the uncertainty around the terms under which United Kingdom will exit the European Union in March 2019. Any of these events or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThere is a risk that even when overall global economic conditions are positive, we could experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. During past periods of recovery, we have experienced inconsistent results, with some geographical regions, or countries within a region, suffering declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction may affect demand for our solutions and services, and there is a risk that, even during times of strengthening global economic conditions, we may not experience uniform, or any, increases in demand for our solutions and services within the markets where our business is concentrated.\nEven without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our staffing assignments. This situation can be exacerbated by uncertain and volatile economic conditions, which may cause clients to reduce or defer projects for which they utilize our services, thereby negatively affecting demand for them. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and office investments necessary to profitably operate our business or take advantage of growth opportunities.\nWe may lack the speed and agility to respond to the needs of our clients.\nThere is a risk we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed and agility to the needs of our clients, which may change rapidly as their businesses evolve. The size and breadth of our organization, comprising approximately 30,000 employees based out of nearly 2,600 offices in 80 countries and territories, may make it difficult for us to effectively manage our resources and provide coordinated solutions to our clients who require our services in multiple locations. For example, client demands for uniform service across borders may be difficult to satisfy because of variation in local laws and customs. We see a trend in more multi-country and enterprise-level relationships, and we may have difficulty in profitably managing and delivering projects involving multiple countries. Also, our size and organizational structure may make it difficult to develop and implement new processes and tools across the enterprise in a consistent manner. If we are not effective at meeting the needs of our current and prospective clients, or our competitors are more agile or effective at doing so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.\nThe worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, and in recent years has undergone significant consolidation. We compete in markets throughout the world with full-service and specialized employment services agencies. Several of our global competitors, including The Adecco Group and Randstad, have very substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. Portions of our industry may become increasingly commoditized, with the result that competition in key areas could become more focused on pricing. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. There is a risk that we will not compete effectively, including on price, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share and could materially adversely affect our financial results. This may worsen as clients increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party.\nWe may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives.\nOur business strategy focuses on growing revenues while improving our operating profits. An important element of our strategy is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and employment services through the sale of innovative workforce solutions designed to achieve higher operating margins. These workforce solutions are often unique, non-repeatable and tailored to a client\u2019s needs, and present costs, risks and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be unprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in our pricing for these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and price our solutions in a manner\nthat properly compensates us to create an adequate delivery model, to adequately manage new solutions, or to obtain adequate insurance coverage in amount or scope to cover potential risks arising from such solutions.\nOur business strategy also includes continuing efforts to transform how we use personnel and technology to enhance our delivery of services. Our goal is to become a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. These efforts to transform how we do business may not be successful, and we may not succeed at reducing our operating costs or preventing the return of any costs that are eliminated. Additionally, reductions in personnel and other changes could materially adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business. If, for these or other reasons, we are not successful in implementing our business strategy or achieving the anticipated results, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions.\nOur success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve, and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the workforce services industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll, and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk they will be unsuccessful. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nWe could incur liabilities or our reputation could be damaged from a cyberattack or improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate, candidate or client data, including personal data.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally identifiable and sensitive. We expect our use of data to increase, including through the use of analytics. In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third party vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees, vendors or third parties, including a cyberattack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy social engineering attacks, viruses, ransomware, worms or other malicious software programs, or obtain credentials to our systems through other unrelated cyberattacks.\nAn incident involving disclosure, system failure, data modification, loss or security breach could harm our reputation and subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, as well as liability under our contracts and laws that protect personally identifiable and confidential data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems and other fraudulent activities, such as social engineering, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.\nIt is possible that our and our third party vendors\u2019 preventative security controls and practices may not thwart unauthorized access to, disclosure of, or loss of personally identifiable and confidential data, or fraudulent activity.\nThe potential risk of security breaches, fraud and cyberattacks may increase as we continue to introduce services and offerings, whether mobile, cloud, or otherwise. Any additional services and offerings inevitably increase the opportunity for a cyberattack against us. Further, data privacy and security is subject to frequently changing laws and regulations, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act. These laws and regulations are increasing in number, complexity, burden and potential financial penalties, and are often inconsistent among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. For example, in 2018, European regulators began conducting audits and investigations and imposing fines on entities subject to the GDPR, which carries a potential maximum fine of up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenues.\nAny failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, storage, processing, disclosure, transfer, destruction or security of personally identifiable data or other privacy and security related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, or any failure to mitigate other cyberattacks or material vulnerabilities, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace. The increasing discovery and/or disclosure of material vulnerabilities in various systems and components, along with the uncertainty concerning patches to those material vulnerabilities and the emergence of malware and tools to exploit those material vulnerabilities, may also have a detrimental effect on our cybersecurity posture and the ability to thwart a cyberattack. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, social engineering, cyberattacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach.\nWe have outsourced aspects of our business, which could result in disruption and increased costs.\nWe have outsourced important aspects of our business to third party vendors, which exposes us to other risks, including increased costs and potential disruptions to our business operations. For example, we rely on third parties to host, manage and secure certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure, to develop and maintain new technology for attracting, onboarding, managing, and analyzing our workforce, and to provide certain back office support. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk that our vendors will be unable to provide these services consistent with our needs. Additionally, we replace these vendors from time to time, and there is a risk that we might suffer interruptions in service or data loss as we transition from one vendor to another. Our operations depend significantly upon these vendors\u2019 and our ability to protect our data and to ensure the availability of our servers, software applications and websites. Despite our and our third party vendors\u2019 implementation of security measures, our systems remain susceptible to system failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar incidents, any of which could result in disruptions to our operations. A successful breach of the security of our technology systems could result in the theft of confidential, personally identifiable, or other sensitive data, including data about our employees and/or associates, or our human resources operations. If the cost of our outsourced services is more than expected, if we are not able to realize the savings associated with outsourcing services or if there is a disruption or security breach of our outsourced services that results in a loss or damage to our data, in a deficiency of our internal operations or controls, or in an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personally identifiable, or sensitive data, or if our ability to deliver our services is interrupted, then our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nForeign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAlthough we report our results of operations in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Highly inflationary economies of certain foreign countries, such as Argentina in 2018, can result in foreign currency devaluation, which may also negatively impact our reported financial results.\nDuring 2018, approximately 88% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, the majority of which were generated in Europe. Furthermore, $1,075.4 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 was denominated in foreign currencies, including $1,024.6 million related to our Euro-denominated notes (\u20ac900.0 million). Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar against other major currencies, or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into United States dollars, could affect our revenues, operating profit and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign currencies, in particular the Euro, could have a material adverse effect on our reported\nresults and shareholders\u2019 equity, however, such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. Furthermore, the volatility of currencies may make year-over-year comparability of our financial results difficult.\nWe seek to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing net investment hedges and, from time to time, foreign currency forward exchange contracts. A portion of our Euro-denominated notes has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiaries with a Euro-functional currency as of December 31, 2018, to mitigate our Euro currency translation exposure. The effectiveness of this hedge in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain or uneven demand for our services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates over the time the hedge is in place or effective.\nA loss or reduction in revenues from large client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national and multinational client relationships. These large national and multinational clients, which comprised approximately 58% of our revenues in 2018, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, and the client is generally able to terminate their contract with us on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of one or more large national and/or multinational clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. A loss or reduction in revenues from our large national and multinational clients could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertain economic conditions may adversely impact our liquidity\nOur working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables which generally increase as sales increase. One of the ways in which we measure our working capital is in terms of working capital as a percent of revenue with a focus on Days Sales Outstanding (\u201cDSO\u201d). During periods of decline or uncertainty, our clients may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. In addition, some clients have begun to impose more challenging billing terms, which increases the length of time before we receive payment for services. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our DSO will increase and our cash flow, liquidity, and profitability may suffer.\nOur performance on contracts may be materially adversely affected if we or third parties fail to deliver on commitments.\nOur contracts are increasingly complex and, in most instances, require that we partner with other parties to provide the workforce solutions required by our clients. Our ability to deliver these solutions and provide the services required by our clients is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our clients' delivery requirements and schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services on time and in accordance with contractual performance obligations, then our ability to successfully complete our contracts may be affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our client relations, revenues and profitability.\nIf we lose our key personnel, then our business may suffer.\nOur operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of headquarters management and staff, our local managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. If we were to lose key personnel who have acquired significant experience in managing our business or managing companies on a global basis or in key markets, it could have a significant impact on our operations.\nIntense competition may limit our ability to attract, train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients\u2019 staffing needs.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. In many markets, we have been experiencing an unusually tight labor market, with historically low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable\nto meet our clients' requirements in identifying an adequate number of associates. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future. Qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organizations workers from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions, and skillsets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify workers with the required attributes, or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills. If we fail to recruit, train and retain qualified associates who meet the needs of our clients, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur global operations subject us to certain risks beyond our control.\nWith operations in 80 countries and territories around the world, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from political unrest and other political events, regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, strikes and other worker unrest, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflict, severe weather conditions, pandemics and other global health emergencies, disruptions of infrastructure and utilities, cyberattacks, and other events beyond our control. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results.\nGovernment regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings.\nIn many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, Italy and Germany, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in Germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our associates may be used. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates. Additionally, in some countries, trade unions have used the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing contingent workforce solutions. Furthermore, many countries are also expanding enforcement of immigration laws, and there is a risk that we will incur greater expense in connection with immigration law compliance.\nThe countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide;\n\u2022\nrequire new or additional benefits be paid to our associates;\n\u2022\nrequire us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or\n\u2022\nincrease taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes.\nAny future regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services, particularly if we cannot pass along increases in costs to our clients.\nFailure to comply with antibribery and corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries and territories in which we operate. Our employees (but not our associates) are required to participate in a global anticorruption compliance training program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. However, there are no assurances this program will be effective. In many countries where we operate, practices in the local business community may not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption law or regulations. Furthermore, we remain subject to the risk that one of our employees (or one of our associates on a temporary or contract-based assignment) could engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations. Any such violations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs from clients or third parties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. Risks relating to these activities include:\n\u2022\nclaims by our associates of discrimination or harassment directed at them, including claims relating to actions of our clients;\n\u2022\nclaims by our associates of wrongful termination or retaliation;\n\u2022\nclaims arising out of the actions or inactions of our associates, including matters for which we may have indemnified a client;\n\u2022\nclaims arising from violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;\n\u2022\nclaims related to classification of workers as employees or independent contractors;\n\u2022\nclaims related to the employment of undocumented or illegal workers;\n\u2022\npayment of workers\u2019 compensation claims and other similar claims;\n\u2022\nviolations of employee pay and benefits requirements such as violations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u2022\nentitlement to employee benefits, including healthcare coverage;\n\u2022\nerrors and omissions of our associates and other individuals working on our behalf in performing their jobs, such as accountants, IT professionals, engineers and other technical workers; and\n\u2022\nclaims by our clients relating to our associates\u2019 misuse of clients\u2019 proprietary information, misappropriation of funds, other criminal activity or torts or other similar claims.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business. In the past several years, we devoted considerable time and expense to resolve several California-based \u201cwage and hour\u201d claims that asserted deficiencies in our payroll practices, and we cannot be certain we will not experience similar claims in the future.\nWe cannot be certain our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies.\nOur business exposes us to competition law risk.\nWe are subject to antitrust and competition law in the United States, the European Union, and many other regions in which we operate. Some of our business models may carry a heightened risk of regulatory inquiry under relevant competition laws. Although we have put in place safeguards designed to maintain compliance with applicable competition laws, there can be no assurance these protections will be adequate, and there is a risk that we will be subject to regulatory investigation by relevant authorities. For example, in 2009, we were fined by the French Competition Council following a 2004 investigation. As previously reported, in 2013, the French Competition Authority commenced another investigation covering ManpowerGroup and a number of our competitors in France. In February 2019, the French Competition Authority announced that they have closed the investigation.\nThere continues to be a risk, in France and in the other countries where we operate, of inquiries by competition law regulators into how we operate our business. There is no assurance we will successfully defend against such regulatory inquiries, and they may consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, remain outstanding for a significant duration, and result in adverse publicity, even if successfully resolved. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these matters and any future matters could, individually or in the aggregate, result in substantial liabilities that have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe believe our reputation, along with our brand equity in the ManpowerGroup name and our various other brands, are important corporate resources that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute\nto our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, franchisees and other third-party brand licensees, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about ManpowerGroup, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could materially adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could materially adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the ManpowerGroup name and our other brand names, and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\nChanges in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect the marketplace for our services.\nFrom time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when clients use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and share price could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements timely, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. If any of these were to occur, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business due to unexpected or underestimated costs.\nFrom time to time, we make acquisitions of other companies or operating assets or enter into operating joint ventures. These activities involve significant risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the operations, financial reporting, services and corporate culture of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nfailure of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form, to meet performance expectations, which could trigger payment obligations;\n\u2022\nover-valuation by us of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form;\n\u2022\ndisputes that arise with sellers;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively monitor compliance with corporate policies as well as regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ninsufficient indemnification from the selling parties for liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business. In addition, future acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, or restructuring charges could also occur.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our thought leadership and other intellectual property, which is important to our success.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property including the value of our brands. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products, services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.\nOur debt levels could materially adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1,075.4 million of total debt. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, significant acquisition opportunities, or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing;\n\u2022\nborrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at a variable interest rate, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and\n\u2022\nwe could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions.\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates.\nThe lenders under our and our subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to extend credit to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf our liquidity needs increase, we would expect to use our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Each bank in the syndicate is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans under the facility. If any of the participants in the syndicate fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, the other participants refuse or are unable to assume its obligations and we are unable to find an alternative source of funding at comparable rates, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected or our interest expense may increase substantially.\nFurthermore, a number of our subsidiaries maintain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks. Under the terms of these lines of credit, the bank is not obligated to make loans to the subsidiary or to make loans to the subsidiary at a particular interest rate. If any of these banks cancel these lines of credit or otherwise refuse to extend credit on acceptable terms, we may need to extend credit to those subsidiaries or the liquidity of our subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected.\nThe performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to our parent company may vary, negatively affecting our ability to service our debt at the parent company level or in other subsidiaries.\nSince we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to our parent company, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to our parent company or to other subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends and the making of such loans and advances by our subsidiaries may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions, depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and working capital requirements, and be subject to various business considerations, including the ability of such subsidiaries to pay such dividends or make such loans and advances.\nOur inability to secure guarantees or letters of credit on acceptable terms may substantially increase our cost of doing business in various countries.\nIn a number of countries and territories in which we conduct business we are obligated to provide guarantees or letters of credit to secure licenses, lease space or for insurance coverage. We typically receive these guarantees and letters of credit from a number of financial institutions around the world. In the event that we are unable to secure these arrangements from a bank, lender or other third party on acceptable terms, our liquidity may be materially adversely affected, there could be a disruption to our business or there could be a substantial increase in cost for our business.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or tax audits that could result in additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and rates of these respective tax jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic and political conditions. Our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the respective tax laws. Our other taxes are impacted by changes in local tax laws or changes in our business.\nIn addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer pricing and reporting related to intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to tax examinations by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. These audits may result in additional tax liabilities. Any increase in our income tax provision and other tax provision may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors.\nThe market price for our common stock may be subject to significant volatility. For example, during 2018, the price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a high of $136.02 to a low of $62.59. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including factors listed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and others, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncement of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\nchanges in investor sentiment regarding the company arising from these or other events, or the economy in general.\nWisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of our company more difficult.\nCertain provisions of Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently include:\n\u2022\npermitting removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nproviding that vacancies on the board of directors will be filled by the remaining directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees.\nIn addition, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cfair price\u201d and \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized. The provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 75285, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "MAN"}
