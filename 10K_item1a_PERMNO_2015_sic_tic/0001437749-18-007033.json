{"cik": "946486", "company": "WINDTREE THERAPEUTICS INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and any of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. The following risks, among others, could cause our actual results, performance, achievements or industry results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements contained herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In such case, the market price of our common stock would likely decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Capital Resource Requirements\nAs of April 15, 2018, we currently have sufficient capital to fund our research and development programs, support our business operations and reduce existing obligations on a timely basis to May 2018. If we do not secure additional capital to support our future activities before our existing cash resources are exhausted, we likely will be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 million and current liabilities of $11.7 million. In November 2017, we successfully retired $25 million of long-term debt under the Deerfield Loan. In January 2018 and March 2018, we received interim loans from LPH, an affiliate of Lee\u2019s, in the amounts of $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively. In early April 2018, we completed a $2.6 million private placement offering with LPH II, from which we received net proceeds of approximately $2.5 million. As of April 15, 2018, and before any additional financings, including in connection with potential strategic transactions, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources available to support our development activities and business operations through May 2018.\nWe have not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital, to fund our research and development programs, support our business operations and pay our existing obligations on a timely basis. We are currently planning to secure the additional capital that we will require in the near-term, through a combination of public or private equity offerings, and strategic transactions, including potential alliances and collaborations focused on various individual markets, as well as potential combinations (including by merger or acquisition) or other corporate transactions. If none of these alternatives is available, or if available, we are unable to raise sufficient capital through such transactions, we likely will not have sufficient cash resources and liquidity to fund our business operations, which could significantly limit our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to raise the required capital, we may be forced to curtail all of our activities and, ultimately, cease operations. Even if we are able to raise sufficient capital, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, or result in significant dilution of stockholders\u2019 interests and, in such event, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe will require significant additional capital to support our research and development activities and operations, and our ability to raise such capital may be adversely impacted by a number of factors that may represent significant challenges to accessing the capital markets at a time when we would like or require, and at an increased cost of capital. Moreover, any financings could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nAs of April 15, 2018, and before any additional financings or other strategic transactions, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to support our limited development programs and business operations and reduce obligations to May 2018. Since April 2015, we have focused our capital and resources primarily on the AEROSURF clinical development program, our lyophilized KL4 surfactant and design and development of our NextGen ADS for use in our remaining development activities, including our planned phase 3 clinical program. AEROSURF is our only clinical development program. We expect to continue to require significant additional infusions of capital to execute our business strategy until such time as revenues from the commercialization of AEROSURF, if approved, and from potential strategic alliance and collaboration arrangements, and other sources, are sufficient to offset our cash flow requirements. For the next several years, we do not expect to receive revenues from the sale of approved products, and our cash outflows for development programs, operations and debt service are likely to far outpace the rate at which we may generate revenues and other cash inflows from all available sources. See, \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe plan to seek the additional capital that we require from potential strategic alliances, collaboration arrangements and other similar transactions, and through potential public and private offerings in the equity markets, which could have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. In such event, the issuance, or even potential issuance, of shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. However, a number of factors, including the timing and outcomes of our clinical activities, our status as a smaller reporting company under the SEC regulations, our loss of eligibility to use the registration statement Form S-3 and our at-the-market equity sales program (ATM Program), our delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market in May 2017 and subsequent transfer to the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s OTCQB\u00ae market, our capital structure, which currently consists of common stock, convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock, as well as conditions in the global financial markets generally, may present significant challenges to accessing the capital markets at a time when we would like or require, and at an increased cost of capital. We do not have in place arrangements to obtain additional capital. Any financing could be difficult to obtain or only available on unattractive terms and could result in significant dilution of stockholders\u2019 interests. In any such event, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan, financial performance and stock price and could delay new product development and clinical trial plans.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, curtail or discontinue our research and development programs.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock, including the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock) , could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders, cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nWe will require additional capital to continue to execute our business plan and advance our research and development efforts. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell shares of preferred stock or common stock in one or more transactions at prices that may be at a discount to the then-current market value of our common stock and on such other terms and conditions as we may determine from time to time. Any such transaction could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders. If we sell shares of our common stock in more than one transaction, stockholders who purchase our common stock may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales could also cause a drop in the market price of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with a public or private financing, in connection with our compensation programs, and upon exercise of outstanding warrants will have a dilutive impact on our other stockholders and the issuance, or even potential issuance, of such shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe exercise of stock options and other securities could also cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution. Moreover, holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them, if ever, at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants. Such exercises, or the possibility of such exercises, may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing through the sale of additional securities or make such financing more costly. It may also reduce the price of our common stock.\nThe rights of the holders of our common stock will be subordinate to our creditors and to the holders of our Preferred Stock in a liquidation. No assurance can be given as to the amount of assets, if any, that would be available for common stockholders in the event of a liquidation.\nIn liquidation, the rights of equity security holders like our common stockholders are subordinate to holders of our Preferred Stock and debt obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 million and current liabilities of $11.7 million. In addition, the holders of our Preferred Stock have a preference in liquidation over the holders of our common stock and are entitled to receive up to the greater of three times the amount of their initial investment or the amount to which they would be entitled on an as-converted basis. Accordingly, in the event of liquidation, no assurance can be given as to the amount of remaining assets, if any, available for payment to common stockholders.\nThe market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of many other development stage pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, has been and is likely to be volatile. In addition to general economic, political and market conditions, the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant patient adverse reactions to our products;\n\u2022\ngovernmental approvals, delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the U.S. or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development;\n\u2022\nchanges in the U.S. or foreign political environment and the passage of laws, including tax, environmental or other laws, affecting the product development business;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights, including any third-party challenges of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries; including healthcare reform in the U.S. and pricing and reimbursement policies globally;\n\u2022\nnew accounting standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in executive management; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other public filings.\nOur common stock has been quoted on the OTCQB\u00ae market tier operated by The OTC Markets since May 5, 2017. The price of our common stock has been, and we expect it to remain, volatile. The average daily trading volume in our common stock varies significantly and we have experienced extended periods where the trading volume has been low. The instability observed in our daily volume and number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry. Even if securities class actions that may be filed against us in the future were ultimately determined to be meritless or unsuccessful, they would involve substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur existing and future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition, and if we are unable to meet our debt obligations, the lenders could foreclose on our assets.\nWe currently have loans in the amount of $2.5 million from an affiliate of Lee\u2019s, which we expect to satisfy through Lee\u2019s participation in a future equity financing. To secure our obligations under these loans, we granted to the Lee\u2019s affiliate a security interest in substantially all of our assets. We also have outstanding obligations related to our development activities and ongoing operations of $11.7 million.\nOur debt and financial obligations:\n\u2022\ncould impair our liquidity;\n\u2022\ncould make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate cash flow to payments on our debt and financial obligations, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our ability to incur other indebtedness, grant liens on our assets, and could impede us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on us with respect to our ability to license our products in the U.S. and other markets around the world;\n\u2022\ncould adversely affect our ability to enter into strategic transactions, public or private equity offerings, and similar agreements, or require us to obtain the consent to enter into such transactions;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business prospects and could limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our licensing markets; and\n\u2022\ncould place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors.\nShould we fail to make pay our obligations or fail to comply with any covenants contained in any related agreements, we could be in default regarding that indebtedness. Since we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations to the Lee\u2019s affiliate, a debt default could enable Lee\u2019s to foreclose on the assets securing such debt and could significantly diminish the market value and marketability of our common stock and could result in the acceleration of other payment obligations.\nWe currently require significant additional capital to support our research and development activities and operations and have sufficient cash resources to pay our vendors, service providers and pay other business expenses. As such, we routinely closely monitor and control our cash resources to assure that investment and spending decisions advance our corporate objectives at any time. While we seek to raise the additional capital that we require, our relationships with important vendors and service providers may be affected. If any of our key vendors and service providers were to cease working with us or subject the delivery of products or services to timing or payment preconditions, our development activities may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nDuring and since completion of our AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial and announcement of the results, our cash resources have been constrained. To manage our cash, we have controlled and plan to tightly control purchasing and retention of consultants, monitor the release of funds and may defer payment on invoices to conserve cash. As a consequence, our aged accounts payables are expected to increase and our relationships with key vendors and service providers may be affected. Although LPH\u2019s first quarter loans to us and our recent equity offering in April 2018 have provided capital to support our development activities and business operations and pay our vendors and service providers, we still will require significant additional capital. While we seek the additional capital that we require, we are working closely with our vendors and service providers to preserve our key relationships. Failure to retain such key relationships could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business and operations.\nRisks Related to our Development Activities\nOur clinical development program for AEROSURF involves risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the clinical development. Our clinical trials may be delayed, or fail, which will harm our business prospects.\nBased on the planned top-line results, our AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial did not meet the primary endpoint of a reduction in nCPAP failure at 72 hours. We believe this result was attributable in large part to an unexpected rate of treatment interruptions, which occurred in about 24% of active enrollments, predominantly in the 50-minute dose group. These interruptions, we believe, were primarily related to specific lots of disposable cartridge filters with a higher tendency to clog. We are currently preparing to conduct an AEROSURF \u201cbridge\u201d study to: (i) to gain in-clinic experience with the NextGen ADS, (ii) to confirm whether our device development objectives have been met and (iii) to generate additional higher dose treatment data to augment the higher dose data obtained in the phase 2b clinical trial, which was adversely affected by device-related treatment interruptions. We have previously completed three phase 2 clinical trials for AEROSURF. To gain marketing authorization for AEROSURF, we will need to successfully complete our clinical trials, including a future potential pivotal phase 3 clinical development program. Such development programs generally take years to complete and may be delayed by a number of factors. We may not reach agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or a foreign regulator on the extent of our phase 3 program, the\ndesign of any one or more of the clinical trials necessary for approval, or we may be unable to reach agreement on a single design that would permit us to conduct a common pivotal phase 3 clinical development program in the all markets of interest. Conditions imposed by FDA and foreign regulators on our clinical development program could significantly increase the time required to complete, and the costs of conducting, and the risks associated with clinical trials. For example, we may not be able to design a study that is acceptable to both FDA and EMA regulators, which would cause us to limit the scope of our geographical activities or greatly increase our investment. Even if we obtain promising preliminary findings or results in earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials, we may suffer significant delays or setbacks in any stage of our clinical trials. If any of the risks outlined in this risk factor and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including with respect to regulatory requirements, institutional review board approval, clinical site initiation and supply, patient enrollment, drug manufacture, device development and device performance, lack of compatibility with complementary technologies, or long treatment times required to demonstrate effectiveness, were to delay the results, we might be forced to make changes to our clinical trial plan that we otherwise would not implement, which could adversely affect the results and potentially impair our ability to secure additional capital to fund our continued development program. Even if we complete the clinical trial within our anticipated time, if our results are inconclusive or non-compelling or otherwise insufficient to support a strategic or financing transaction, we potentially could be forced to limit or cease our development activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe timing and completion of clinical trials to study our product candidates depend on many factors, including the rate at which patients are enrolled. Delays in patient enrollment in clinical trials would likely result in increased costs, program delays, or both. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including potentially:\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical sites;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe existence of competing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe existence of alternative available products;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility and enrollment criteria for the study;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients\u2019 parents or guardians to participate in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe trial complexity and resources required by a clinical study site to participate;\n\u2022\navailability of clinical supplies and materials;\n\u2022\nthe existence of alternative available products; and\n\u2022\ngeographical and geopolitical considerations.\nWe have initiated a number of clinical sites outside the U.S. where we use the services of third-party clinical trial consultants and third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to carry out most of our clinical trial related activities and accurately report the results, which may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their activities or meet expected deadlines, our trials may be delayed. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and regulatory aspects of our complex and diverse clinical trials, our studies and any potential regulatory approvals may be delayed, or we may fail to gain approvals for our product candidates.\nWe have engaged and may in the future engage a third-party clinical supply organization (CSO) to assist us in storing, shipping and tracking the drug product, medical devices and other materials that are required for us to conduct our clinical trial in the U.S. and international sites, including potentially in Canada, the EU, Latin America and Asia Pacific. If our CSO fails to timely perform its obligations under our agreement or if we are unable to manufacture an adequate supply of drug, medical devices and other materials to stock inventories with our CSO and provide for delivery to our clinical sites, we may experience delays in the initiation and enrollment activities of our clinical sites, or limit our ability to complete any ongoing clinical trials, which could delay or otherwise impair our ability to execute our clinical trials on a timely basis, if at all.\nMoreover, because AEROSURF is a combination drug-device product, the success of our clinical trial is highly dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and manufacture our ADS and our synthetic lyophilized KL4 surfactant. We are working with our contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to be in a position to manufacture sufficient drug supply for our clinical development program when needed. We also are engaged in design verification procedures with Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle) to complete the collaboration development of our next generation (NextGen) ADS that will replace our prototype ADS used in our phase 2 clinical trials to date and be available for use in our remaining AEROSURF clinical development activities and, if approved, initial commercial activities. We are conducting ongoing assessments of our medical device performance and have incorporated and plan to incorporate performance enhancements into our NextGen ADS as we move forward. If our NextGen ADS should fail to perform as designed, such failures could adversely affect the results of our clinical development program. If we are unsuccessful in our development activities or if for any reason we are unable to obtain active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), or manufacture our drug and medical device to our specifications and on commercially reasonable terms, our clinical trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nIf patients are enrolled in our clinical trials, they could suffer adverse medical events or side effects that are known to be associated with surfactant administration or currently unknown to us. It is also possible that we, our AEROSURF Clinical Trial (ACT) Steering Committee, the Independent Safety Review Committee (ISRC), or the FDA could interrupt, delay or halt any one or more of our clinical trials for AEROSURF or any of our product candidates. If our ACT Steering Committee, the ISRC, any regulator or we believe that study participants face unacceptable health risks, any one or more of our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated. In addition, clinical trials may be interrupted, delayed or halted, in whole or in part, for reasons other than health and safety concerns, including, among other things, matters related to the design of the study, drug availability, ACT Steering Committee and/or ISRC recommendation, or business reasons.\nIn addition, the medical practices and procedures associated with treating RDS can vary between clinicians, medical sites and countries. For instance, we observed differences among clinical sites and on a country by country basis in nCPAP failure rates, in our clinical trials (where nCPAP failure rates have served as control comparators for AEROSURF) and as demonstrated in our Prospective Observational Study. This variability must be accurately estimated when designing and sizing a clinical trial to assure demonstration of efficacy and meeting statistical significance in outcomes. Even when estimated and planned for appropriately, this variability brings additional risk of poor trial outcomes as the trials expand to new centers and countries where we have no prior clinical experience. This risk is inversely related to the size of the trial. Smaller trials may be impacted to a greater degree by variability and have a greater risk of not seeing a true effect when one is actually present. As such, unless an interim analysis is planned in the design, we do not know effects of this or other variability or the results until the trial is fully completed.\nThe regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is uncertain. We may not obtain required regulatory approvals to commercialize our products.\nBefore we can market our products, we must receive regulatory approvals for each product. The FDA and foreign regulators, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), extensively and rigorously regulate the testing, manufacture, distribution, advertising and marketing of drug products. This approval process includes (i) preclinical studies and clinical trials of each drug product candidate and API to establish its safety and effectiveness, and (ii) confirmation by the FDA and foreign regulators that we maintain good laboratory and manufacturing practices during testing and manufacturing. Even if favorable data are generated by clinical trials, the FDA or foreign regulator may not accept, file or approve a new drug application (NDA) or market authorization application (MAA) filed for a drug product on a timely basis or at all. See, \u201cItem 1 - Business - Government Regulation.\u201d\nWe are currently conducting a phase 2 clinical development program for AEROSURF. No assurance can be given that issues requiring protracted and time-consuming preclinical studies will not arise or that our clinical trials will be concluded successfully. Moreover, success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. As a result, data we obtain from our phase 2 clinical trials may not accurately predict phase 3 trial results, whether due to differences in sample size, study arms, duration, endpoints, features of the ADS used or other factors. We are currently planning to conduct an AEROSURF bridge study to transition in the clinic from the phase 2 ADS to the NextGen ADS, which will be used in our planned phase 3 program. In addition, clinical data are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in gaining regulatory approval for AEROSURF.\nClinical trials may indicate that our product candidates lack efficacy, have harmful side effects or raise safety or other concerns that may significantly reduce the likelihood of regulatory approval, result in significant restrictions on use and safety warnings in the approved label, adversely affect placement within the treatment paradigm, or otherwise significantly diminish the commercial potential of the product candidate. Also, positive clinical results may not be replicated in subsequent confirmatory trials. Even if later stage clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the trial design or sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials or add new requirements, such as the completion of additional studies, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data or may fail to approve the processes used to manufacture a product candidate, may find the cGMP compliance status of a facility that manufactures a product candidate unsatisfactory, may fail to approve or delay approval of our product candidates, dosing or delivery methods, companion devices or may otherwise grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated, including indications covering narrow patient populations and the imposition of safety monitoring or educational requirements or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The occurrence of any such events may delay our clinical development and regulatory efforts, delay or prevent our obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates and new indications for existing products, and result in significant additional costs and expenses, require additional time and have an adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations, or cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility. Moreover, after taking such events into account, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline.\nFor AEROSURF, we may conduct clinical development in the U.S., Canada, the EU, Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions and sell our products in the U.S. and potentially in other major markets. To accomplish this objective, we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction. To avoid the significant expense and lengthy time required to complete multiple regional clinical development programs, we expect to meet with relevant regulatory authorities. While we would prefer to design a single, global clinical development program that would satisfy the regulators in all of our target markets, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. If we are unable to reach agreement with the various regulatory authorities, we may not be able to pursue regulatory approval of our products in all of our selected markets.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates for many reasons, which may include:\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may disagree with the design or implementation of one or more clinical trials;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may not deem a product candidate safe and effective for its proposed indication, or may deem a product candidate\u2019s safety or other perceived risks to outweigh its clinical or other benefits;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to support approval, or the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body for approval;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials performed by us or third parties;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may not deem the data collected from clinical trials to be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other applicable regulatory filing;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may identify deficiencies in the formulation, quality control, labeling or specifications of our current or future product candidates;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical trials;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator also may approve our current or any future product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may not approve of the manufacturing processes, controls or facilities of third-party manufacturers or testing labs with which we contract; or\n\u2022\none or both of the FDA or a foreign regulator may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for approval.\nThe approval procedures vary among countries in complexity and timing. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, if at all, which would preclude us from commercializing products in those markets. Even if we demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate, a regulator may require us to demonstrate superiority over comparative products before agreeing to grant marketing approval. Also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. For example, the EU has adopted legislation intended to improve operational efficiency and streamline the overall clinical trial authorization process. The new requirements also provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and submission of quality data relating to the products and product candidates used for such trials. Under the directive, sponsors will be required to submit detailed summaries of the study trial result within one year of termination of the clinical trial. The EMA will make certain clinical trial reports publicly available, which may limit our ability to protect competitively-sensitive information contained in our clinical trial reports. Failure to comply with new laws or regulations could result in significant monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. We are unable to predict when and whether any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as efforts to reform medical device regulation or to implement new requirements for combination products, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, some countries, particularly those in the EU, regulate the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In these countries, pricing discussions with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of their product candidate to other available therapies. Such trials may be time-consuming and expensive, and may not show an advantage in health economics for our products. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, in either the U.S. or the EU, we could be adversely affected.\nFailure to complete the timely development of our NextGen ADS intended for future development activities and, if approved, initial commercial activities in a manner that performs as intended in clinical studies, would have a material adverse effect on our efforts to develop AEROSURF as well as our other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products, and our business strategy.\nFor our phase 2 clinical development activities, we developed a clinic-ready ADS and currently are working with Battelle to further develop a NextGen ADS for use in our remaining AEROSURF development activities and, if approved, initial commercial activities. Our development activities are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nwe may not successfully develop, if at all, and on a timely basis, a NextGen ADS that is acceptable for use in our remaining AEROSURF development activities, with levels of efficiency, consistent performance, reliability and cost appropriate for commercial activities;\n\u2022\nwe will require access to sophisticated engineering capabilities. We have our own medical device engineering staff and we are currently working with Battelle, which is assisting us under a collaboration agreement that is in the final phase of executions. If we are unable to identify design engineers and medical device experts to support our continued development efforts in the future, including, potentially, for commercial use and later versions of the NextGen ADS, it would have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and impair our ability to commercialize or develop AEROSURF or other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products; if we are unable to secure the necessary medical device development expertise to support our development program, this could impair our ability to commercialize or develop AEROSURF or other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products;\n\u2022\nthe ADS may perform to specifications in the bench setting and internal tests, however, at clinical sites with multiple operators of the device, we may experience an unanticipated issue with performance that could have a negative effect on trial outcomes.\nThe realization of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEven though some of our product candidates have Fast Track designation, the FDA may not approve them at all or any sooner than other product candidates that do not have Fast Track designation.\nThe FDA has notified us that three indications of our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) technology pipeline, treatment of RDS, BPD in premature infants and ARDS in adults, have been granted designation as \u201cFast Track\u201d products. Fast Track designation does not accelerate clinical trials nor does it mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent. Instead, Fast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review. We believe that other potential products in our KL4 surfactant technology pipeline may also qualify for Fast Track or other designations, including potentially breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval and priority review. These designations and programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of an NDA to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. Our product candidates may cease to qualify for Fast Track designation and our other product candidates may fail to qualify for any such designation or program. Moreover, even if we are successful in gaining a designation that is intended to facilitate or expedite development or review of a product candidate, other factors could result in significant delays in our development activities with respect to our Fast Track products.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate a drug for relatively small patient populations as Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an Orphan Drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which affects a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.\nThe FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults, and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of CF.\nIf a drug that has Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years. Orphan Drug marketing exclusivity generally prevents the FDA from approving an NDA to market a drug containing the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior to the approved drug. A drug is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan Drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nRisks related to Manufacturing Development and Manufacturing\nWe currently do not have back-up facilities for our CMOs, our suppliers of APIs or excipients, our third-party analytical testing and other materials. If the parties we depend on for supplying our APIs, materials and excipients as well as analytical testing and manufacturing-related services do not timely supply these products and services, it may delay or impair our ability to execute our development plans for our current and potential pipeline products. Such delays could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nIn most cases, we are dependent upon a single supplier to provide all of our requirements for our APIs, materials and excipients or one or more of our drug product device subcomponents, components and subassemblies, analytical testing and manufacturing-related services. We rely on single CMOs to manufacture drug product that meets appropriate content, quality and stability standards for use in preclinical programs and clinical trials. Our ability to manufacture depends upon receiving adequate supplies and related services, which may be difficult or uneconomical to procure. Supply chain or manufacturing interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance. The supply of any of our manufacturing materials may be interrupted because of supply shortages, poor vendor performance or other events outside our control, which may require us, among other things, to identify alternate vendors, which could involve a lengthy process, and result in increased expenses.\nWe have supply agreements relating to continued access to APIs with only two of the three providers of drug substances. However, to assure compliance with cGMP requirements, we have entered into Quality Agreements with all of our suppliers of APIs and related materials. We also have quality and service agreements with our third-party laboratories who provide the analytical testing and related services needed to support manufacture of our drug product. If we do not maintain these manufacturing and service relationships that are important to us and are not able to identify replacement suppliers, vendors and laboratories, or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products could be impaired or delayed and our costs could substantially increase. Even if we are able to find replacement manufacturers, suppliers, vendors and service providers when needed, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us or there could be a substantial delay before such manufacturer, vendor or supplier, or a related new facility is properly qualified and registered with the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. The process of changing a supplier could have an adverse impact on our current clinical development programs if supplies of drug substances, materials or excipients on hand are insufficient to satisfy demand. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business.\nWe plan to rely on third parties to manufacture our lyophilized KL4 surfactant and manufacture and assemble our medical devices, which exposes us to risks that may affect our ability to maintain supplies of our clinical materials and ADSs and could potentially delay our research and development activities, as well as eventual regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug product candidates.\nOur manufacturing strategy for AEROSURF includes manufacturing our lyophilized KL4 surfactant and our ADS using third-party CMOs. Technology transfers of our manufacturing process and our planned future reliance on CMOs exposes us, among other things, to the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify manufacturers with whom we might establish appropriate arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, because the number of potential CMOs is limited and, after a product candidate is approved, the FDA must approve any transfer to a different CMO. This approval could require one or more pre-approval inspections as well as a potentially lengthy qualification process. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our approved products after receipt of FDA approval. To qualify and receive regulatory approval for a new manufacturer could take as long as 2 years;\n\u2022\nwe may implement a plan to execute a technology transfer of our manufacturing process to a CMO and, after investing significant time and resources, learn that the CMO we chose is unable to successfully complete the technology transfer and thereafter manufacture our products in accordance with our plan;\n\u2022\nCMOs might be unable to manufacture our products in the volume and to our specifications to meet our clinical and commercial needs, or we may have difficulty scheduling the production of drug product and devices in a timely manner to meet our timing requirements;\n\u2022\nCMOs may not perform as agreed, or may not remain in the CMO business for a lengthy time, or may refuse to renew an expiring agreement as expected, or may fail timely to produce a sufficient supply to meet our commercial and/or clinical needs;\n\u2022\nCMOs are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, international health authorities, registered Notified Body(ies), the Drug Enforcement Administration, and/or corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and/or QSR and other government regulations and corresponding international standards. Although we do not have control over the day-to-day operations of any CMO we may use, we are responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations and standards, and the failure of a CMO to have a compliance status acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities would delay approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nif we desire to make our drug products and/or devices available outside the U.S. for clinical or commercial purposes, our CMOs would become subject to, and may not be able to comply with, corresponding manufacturing and quality system regulations or standards of the various foreign regulators having jurisdiction over our activities abroad. Such failures (such as in-country quality testing) could result in not only a loss of approved supply to that country, but a total loss of a lot (or lots) of materials globally and could restrict our ability to execute our business strategies;\n\u2022\nif any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not have rights to, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any such innovation. Such an event could limit our ability to conduct technology transfers to alternate and successor manufacturers. We may be required to pay fees or other costs for access to such improvements; and\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty implementing changes or modifications to our manufacturing processes that may be required by the FDA or foreign regulator, if, for example, such changes would burden our CMO or otherwise disrupt operations, or our CMO could impose significant financial terms to implement any such change that could adversely affect our business. Failure to achieve such required changes or modifications could delay or prevent our gaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or prevent us from continuing to market our approved products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nEach of the foregoing risks and others could delay our development programs and, if approved, commercial manufacturing plans, limit our ability to maintain continuity of supply for our approved products, delay or impair the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA, or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nManufacturing problems potentially could cause us to experience shortages of APIs, lyophilized KL4 surfactant drug product, medical devices, and materials, or delay our preclinical or clinical development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical and medical device products requires significant expertise and compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We, our CMOs or our materials and drug substances suppliers may experience manufacturing or quality control and assurance problems that could result in a failure to maintain compliance with cGMP and QSR requirements, or those of foreign regulators or notified bodies, which is necessary to continue manufacturing of our drug products, materials, drug substances, or medical devices. Other problems that may be encountered include:\n\u2022\nthe need to make necessary modifications to maintain a qualified facility;\n\u2022\ndifficulties with production and yields, including manufacturing and completing all required release testing on a timely basis to meet demand;\n\u2022\nquality control and assurance problems related to, among other things, in-process monitoring and controls, and release and stability testing of our drug product, or materials and drug substances;\n\u2022\ncasualty damage to a facility; and\n\u2022\nshortages of qualified personnel.\nSuch a failure could result in product production and shipment delays or an inability to obtain materials or drug substance supplies.\nWe manufacture our lyophilized KL4 surfactant product candidate, our ADS and aerosol-conducting airway connector using CMOs. If manufacturing or quality control problems should arise at the facilities of a CMO or a manufacturer of our APIs and materials suppliers, such problems may require potentially complex, time-consuming and costly comprehensive investigations to determine the root causes of such problems and may require detailed and time-consuming remediation efforts, which can further delay a return to normal manufacturing and production activities. Any failure by our CMOs or by the manufacturing operations of any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory manufacturing standards, including cGMP or QSR, or other FDA or similar foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our drug product and medical device candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce our drug and medical device products or obtain approval of our product candidates, and potentially adversely affect our research activities and our business and financial condition. A number of factors could cause interruptions in supply, including:\n\u2022\nequipment malfunctions or failures;\n\u2022\nlack of availability of raw materials or subcomponents,\n\u2022\ntechnology malfunctions;\n\u2022\ninterruption of material availability;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or slowdowns;\n\u2022\ndamage to or destruction of the facility;\n\u2022\nregional power shortages; and\n\u2022\nproduct tampering.\nIn connection with our drug product manufacturing activities, we own certain specialized manufacturing equipment installed at our CMO. However, we do not have fully-redundant systems and equipment to respond promptly in the event of a significant loss at a CMO's manufacturing operations. Under certain conditions, we may be unable to produce our drug product and medical devices at the required volumes or to appropriate standards, if at all. If we are unable to successfully maintain our manufacturing capabilities and at all times comply with cGMP and QSRs, it will adversely affect our development activities and clinical development programs.\nFor the development and, if approved, commercialization of AEROSURF, we will depend upon third parties to manufacture and assemble our ADS. If we are unable to identify and subsequently retain qualified manufacturers and assemblers, our ability to implement our plans for the further development of AEROSURF and, if approved, commercialization of AEROSURF, will be adversely affected and both AEROSURF and our other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products could be severely impacted.\nFor AEROSURF, we plan to rely on CMOs to manufacture and assemble the NextGen ADS and all subcomponents to support any preclinical experiments, our ongoing and planned clinical trials and, if approved, commercial activities. The ADS includes a durable device and disposable elements that are either manufactured or cleaned in an environmentally-controlled area. Each ADS is tested for conformance to designated product specifications during assembly must be quality control tested prior to release and monitored for conformance to designated product specifications.\nWe worked with Battelle to develop a clinic-ready ADS to support our phase 2 clinical development program and currently are collaborating on design verification of our NextGen ADS. Although we have identified a CMO that we expect will be able to produce and assemble the ADS for our future development activities, as with many device development initiatives, there is a risk that, even if we are able to finalize a technology transfer and related agreement, the CMO that we have selected may be unable to consistently manufacture and assemble the subcomponents of our ADS to our specified standards. In addition, the manufacturers and assemblers that we identify may be unable to timely comply with FDA, or other foreign regulatory agency regulatory manufacturing requirements. If we do not successfully identify and enter into agreements with manufacturers and assemblers that have the required expertise to produce our NextGen ADS, it will adversely affect our timeline for the development and, if approved, commercialization of AEROSURF.\nRisks Related to our Business and Strategy\nWe are continually evaluating our business strategy and may modify this strategy in light of developments in our business and other factors.\nWe continually evaluate our business strategy and plan to modify our strategy as necessary to achieve our objectives. The execution of a clinical development program is complex and involves the cooperation of many individuals and entities, including third parties that we may not be able to control, and requires the coordination of a number of elements, any one of which could involve delays or unforeseen events or circumstances that require adjustment or the development of alternative strategies. If we encounter such events or circumstances, we will change our strategy and plans if we believe that such a change will be in our best interest. There can be no assurance even if we alter our strategy or plans, that we will be successful, or that we will secure regulatory approval for our products and execute any product launches effectively and on time, if at all, in all markets that we may identify. To respond to changing circumstances, we may also expand or alter our research and development activities from time to time, and allocate resources to work on development of different products or may pace, delay or halt the development of potential product programs. As a result of changes in our strategy, we may also change or refocus our existing drug development and manufacturing activities or our plans for commercialization of our products, if approved. These decisions could require changes in our facilities and personnel and restructuring various financial arrangements. There can be no assurances that any product development or other changes that we implement will be successful or that, after implementation of any such changes, that we will not refocus our efforts on new or different objectives.\nWe have limited resources, which could impair our ability to manage our diverse activities and accomplish our business objectives.\nThe demands on our management team have grown over time. Our capital resource and budget constraints have put our management under pressure to execute our business strategy with limited resources. Furthermore, as a result of our limited capital resources, our management team has had to dedicate an increasing amount of time towards raising capital, which diverts their attention away from our AEROSURF development program.\nOur development program for AEROSURF has progressed to a planned bridge study following our phase 2b clinical trial. Over time, our planned clinical trials are expected to enroll more patients, be conducted in a larger number of sites in the U.S., Canada, EU, Latin America, and Asia Pacific and will require more of our management resources to be successful. In addition to the AEROSURF development program, from time to time, we support studies of other potential KL4 surfactant pipeline products. To assist us with the development and, if approved, commercialization of our products, we have also devoted resources to identifying potential strategic partnerships, collaboration arrangements and similar transactions, in the U.S., EU, Latin America and other potential markets. These activities have and will continue to place additional significant demands on our management and our financial and operational resources, and will require that we continue to develop and improve our financial, operational and other internal controls. From time to time, we will be required to make difficult decisions on how to best allocate our resources.\nIf we are successful in identifying potential strategic or collaboration partners, we will be required to dedicate management resources and implement controls to establish alliance structures, and potentially add a layer of complexity to our operations. We plan to identify potential strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements that would have the resources and capabilities to not only help develop our products but would also distribute our products either globally or in specific regions or countries. This expansion could further increase the challenges involved in implementing appropriate operational and financial systems, expanding manufacturing and production capacity, expanding infrastructure and capabilities, and providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards. We believe that the significant challenges associated with these potential activities will require us to recruit, train and integrate skilled management, scientific, medical and operations personnel; establish and effectively manage strategic partnerships and collaboration arrangements to support our development and commercialization activities; and provide for manufacturing, including analytical testing and distribution capabilities, for our products, and clinical capabilities for our products under development. Our inability to grow our business effectively and appropriately or otherwise adapt to these challenges would cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nRisks Related to Strategic and Other Transactions\nOur plan to use strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements to leverage partner capabilities may not be successful if we are unable to integrate their capabilities with our own or if our partners' capabilities do not meet our expectations. Moreover, if our strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements should require greater focus and attention on our part than we expect, we may be forced to divert our limited resources away from our own development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and plans.\nAs part of our strategy, we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements, although there can be no assurance that we would be able to consummate any strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements. For these efforts to be successful, we must first identify partners whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours. Among other things, technologies or know how to which we gain access may prove ineffective or unsafe. Ownership of these technologies or know-how may be disputed. The agreements that grant us access to such technologies may expire and may not be renewable or could be terminated if our partners or we do not meet our respective obligations. In addition, our partners may provide certain services for us, such as product development support or distribution or commercialization services. These agreements may be subject to differing interpretations and we and our partners may not agree on the appropriate interpretation or specific requirements. Among other things, our partners may prove difficult to work with, less effective than we originally expected or unable to satisfy their financial and other commitments to us. Failure of our partners to perform as needed could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, if we are forced to allocate unplanned resources to bolster our strategic alliances or collaboration arrangement, our limited resources may be diverted from our core activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and plans.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements, which could expose us to risks associated with the transfer of control to third parties and may require that we transfer rights to our products to our partners and collaborators. In addition, if such arrangements potentially provide for the marketing and sale of our products, if approved, including AEROSURF, we will be exposed to additional risks.\nTo support our AEROSURF development program and potentially the commercial introduction of AEROSURF, we seek to identify potential strategic partners who could provide local development and commercial expertise as well as financial resources (potentially in the form of upfront payments, milestone payments, commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses), although there can be no assurance that we will ultimately secure such an alliance on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we succeed in entering into one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements, our ability to execute our operating plan will depend upon numerous factors, including the performance of the strategic partners and collaborators with whom we may engage. Under these arrangements, our partners may control key decisions relating to the development and, if approved, commercialization of our products and may require that we transfer to them important rights to our products and/or product candidates. We may not be able to control the timing or resources that our partners devote to our arrangement. In addition, if we or our strategic alliance partners, distributors or collaborators breach or terminate our agreements or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under our distribution or commercialization arrangements to our satisfaction, we may not achieve our goals within the desired time, if at all, and projected sales and our revenues would suffer.\nIf a strategic partner, distributor or collaborator were to enter into a business combination or other significant transaction, such transaction may adversely affect a partner or collaborator's willingness or ability to perform its obligations, which would adversely affect our business. We also may incur additional expense to terminate such arrangements and to identify and enter into arrangements with replacement partners or collaborators. Moreover, we may have difficulty enforcing our rights in a foreign jurisdiction. Upon termination of any such agreements, we would need to identify other partners or collaborators or develop our own internal capabilities to develop and commercialize our products, which could involve a significant investment and a potentially unacceptable delay. If we, our partners or our collaborators fail to conduct our respective activities in a timely manner, or otherwise breach or terminate the agreements that make up our arrangements, or if a dispute should arise under our agreements or collaboration arrangements, such events could impair our ability to commercialize or develop our products in a competitive and timely manner and would have a material adverse effect on the commercialization of our products.\nIn entering into any collaboration arrangement, we also will need to consider whether such collaboration could impair our ability to enter into other strategic transactions, including a potential merger or acquisition. We may find it difficult, for example, to identify and enter into commercialization agreements acceptable terms, if at all, in limited territories in the EU, where we have a collaboration with Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A. (Esteve) in a territory consisting of Andorra, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain (the Esteve Territory). If we identify potential collaborators for all or parts of the remainder of the EU, strategic differences could arise, which could result in disputes or otherwise impede the progress of our collaborations. Moreover, if a collaborator or its sublicensees does not meet their obligations, our arrangements may not be successful, and, as a result, we may not receive any revenues.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation, Quality and Safety\nIssues with product quality could have an adverse effect on our business, subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation and cause a loss of confidence in our products or us.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop quality products. Our future revenues will depend upon our ability to develop, maintain, and continuously improve our quality management system, including an objective and systematic process for monitoring and the evaluation of key process indicators. Quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. We are dependent upon third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to support our development and commercialization activities. Third-party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third-party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays or other quality-related issues. A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on patients receiving our drug products and on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in our current or future products or us, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in commercializing our products.\nAdverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, potential future product sales and stock price.\nAdverse safety events involving our products under development and our marketed products may have a negative impact on our business. Safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, withdrawal of products from the market, and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician and patient confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nIf we enter into strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements, failure of a strategic partner or collaborator to maintain appropriate risk management and adverse event reporting controls exposes us to additional risk.\nRegulatory authorities are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or products similar to ours or any public rumors about such events may give rise to claims against us and may also adversely affect our ability to market our products and conduct our clinical development programs.\nOur activities are subject to various and complex laws and regulations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment. Any failure to comply could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products and our operations are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the U.S. Our drug product candidates and medical devices must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Our facilities and those of our third-party providers must pass inspection and/or be approved or licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection at any time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our post-marketing reporting, could result in warning or untitled letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of our products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our sales. In addition, requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities may change and implementing any additional compliance requirements may increase our costs, or force us or our third-party providers to suspend production, which could result in a shortage of our approved product or delays in the commercial introduction of our new product candidates, if approved.\nThe Health Care Reform Law includes provisions, referred to as the federal \"Open Payments\" law (previously referred to as the \"Sunshine Law\"), that establish new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. Under the law, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are required to annually report various types of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are to report data to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on an annual basis, and the data are made publicly available via a CMS website. Inaccurate or incomplete reports may be subject to enforcement, and it is expected that data will be subject to significant public scrutiny. Like the federal Open Payments law, several states have existing laws that require manufacturers to report transfers of value to select healthcare providers licensed within the state, or even go so far as to prohibit certain marketing related activities. Other states, such as California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Connecticut, require pharmaceutical and/or device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. In others, it is possible that we will be subject to the state's reporting requirements and prohibitions. Compliance activities with respect to these measures could increase our costs and adversely affect business operations.\nIf AEROSURF is approved for commercial sale, we will be required to comply with not only the requirements of the FDA and potentially international regulators, but will also become subject to various federal, state and international laws regulating the sales, marketing, and distribution of healthcare-related products. These laws govern such activities as our relationships with healthcare providers, the promotion of our products, and pricing of prescription drug products and medical devices. The sales and marketing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA and other federal regulators have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, off-label promotion of products, and other healthcare related laws, antitrust and other competition laws. The Department of Justice (DOJ) also has increased its focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies' sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers.\nOf particular importance, federal and state anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. These laws can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. In addition, the absence of guidance for some of these laws and the very few court decisions addressing industry practices increase the likelihood that our practices could be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to the government (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. In addition, a number of states require that companies implement compliance programs or comply with industry ethics codes, adopt spending limits, and report to state governments any gifts, compensation, and other remuneration provided to physicians. Many pharmaceutical, device, and other health care companies have been investigated and prosecuted for alleged violations of these laws. Sanctions under these laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), criminal fines, and imprisonment. Companies that have chosen to settle these alleged violations have typically paid multi-million-dollar fines to the government and agreed to abide by corporate integrity agreements, which often include significant and costly burdens. Under the federal False Claims Act and related state laws, private individuals may bring similar actions. In addition, an increasing number of state laws require manufacturers to report to the state certain pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the state authorities.\nIn addition, failure to comply with domestic and international privacy and security laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties. The costs of compliance with these laws, including protecting electronically stored information from cyber-attacks, and potential liability associated with failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or collectively, HIPAA. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA.\nWe are continually evaluating our compliance programs, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the outlined above. However, no compliance program can mitigate risk in its entirety. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe political and healthcare policy environment is becoming more challenging for pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers and may adversely affect our business.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences globally are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental challenges that could substantially affect our business and results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing to arise in many countries where we potentially may seek to do business, including the U.S. There is increasing pressure on pricing, reimbursement and demands for value-based data to gain access to patients and healthcare funds globally. This may increase the costs of development, risks of commercialization and overall value of the opportunity.\nGiven the increasing uncertainty in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, capital investment in our industry and our ability to attract capital investment is becoming more challenging. This trend, if continued, may restrict or impair our ability to gain necessary funding for continued development and, if approved, commercialization of our products.\nThe RDS market and sales of therapies to treat RDS are global (with most occurring outside the U.S.). Political, trade policy, currency and conflicts can arise which may affect our ability to develop and market globally.\nOther Risks Affecting our Business\nLee\u2019s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited has a significant influence on our business operations.\nAs of April 3, 2018, Lee's, beneficially owns, through its affiliates LPH and LPH II, approximately 60% of our issued and outstanding common stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of our Preferred Stock and shares issuable upon exercise of warrants. Because Lee's is by far our largest shareholder and owns a majority of our outstanding common stock, it has the voting power to approve any matter that requires shareholder approval by written consent without a stockholder meeting. As a result, Lee's has significant influence over our business operations and capital raising activities, and therefore, Lee's could cause corporate actions to be taken even if the interests of Lee's conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing institutional investor interest in the Company or a change in control that might be beneficial to our other stockholders.\nIf our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we engage in business development activities intended to identify strategic opportunities, including potential strategic alliances, joint development opportunities, acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements and other similar opportunities. Such opportunities may result in substantial investments in our business. Our success in developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for investment, alliance or acquisition; whether we are able to complete an investment, alliance or acquisition on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of our underlying technology, products and our ability to execute our business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully execute the investment, alliance or acquisition into our existing operations, including to fund our share of any in-process research and development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to secure needed capital and expertise to support our development programs and our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections that our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to the cost or timing of clinical development programs, product approval, production and supply dates, commercial launch dates, and other financial or operational matters) reflect numerous assumptions developed by management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections and management\u2019s expectations in (or incorporated by reference in) this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as an indication that we or our management or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which will likely result in significant legal and accounting expense and diversion of management resources, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the market price of our stock will likely decline.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and to disclose any changes in internal controls.\nAny failure to maintain internal controls could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. If we do not file our financial statements on a timely basis as required by the SEC, we could face severe consequences. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, in the future our controls and procedures may no longer be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. Responding to inquiries from the SEC, regardless of the outcome, are likely to consume a significant amount of our management resources and cause us to incur significant legal and accounting expense. Further, many companies that have restated their historical financial statements have experienced a decline in stock price and related stockholder lawsuits.\nOur corporate compliance program cannot ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations affecting our activities, including in the jurisdictions in which we may sell our products, if approved, and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in litigation related to noncompliance could harm our business.\nMany of our activities, including the research, development, manufacture, sale and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive laws and regulation, including without limitation, health care \"fraud and abuse\" laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and other state and federal laws and regulations. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance policy and oversight program based upon what we understand to be current industry best practices, but we cannot assure you that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such investigations, actions or lawsuits are instituted against us, and if we are not successful in defending or disposing of them without liability, such investigations, actions or lawsuits could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions and could otherwise have a significant impact on our business.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about milestones and advances in development, market need and opportunity, drug products and related diseases. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear or responsive to the changing technological environment. There has been an emerging scrutiny and enforcement of investor relations communication by the FDA as well. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend ourselves or the public's legitimate interests in the face of political or market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\nFailure in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party contractors maintain sensitive data on our and their respective networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our clinical trial participants and business partners. In particular, we rely on contract research organizations and other third parties to store and manage information from our clinical trials, including our AEROSURF phase 2 clinical development program. The secure maintenance of this sensitive information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party contractors are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, human error, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. In particular, we believe that companies and other entities and individuals have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems and information. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems or those of our third-party contractors. For information stored with our third-party contractors, we rely upon, and the integrity and confidentiality of such information is dependent upon, the risk mitigation efforts such third-party contractors have in place. In the recent past, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our and our third-party contractors\u2019 respective network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. System failures, data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. System failures or accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our clinical trial patients and others. Cyber-attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate public disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability as a result of legal claims or proceedings, under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties. Furthermore, our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nA catastrophic event at our Warrington, Pennsylvania facility or any of the facilities used by our third-party manufacturers would prevent us from producing our drug product candidates and/or medical devices.\nAll of our facilities are located at our headquarters in Warrington, Pennsylvania. We maintain our analytical testing and device development laboratories in Warrington, Pennsylvania. We depend upon third-party manufacturers and laboratories, to manufacture our lyophilized KL4 surfactant, our AFECTAIR device and our ADS and perform important API and drug product release testing and stability work. We expect initially to manufacture each of these products at a single source facility. If a catastrophic event occurred at our headquarters facility or the facilities of any of our third-party manufacturers and laboratories, such as a fire, flood or tornado, many of those products could not be produced until the manufacturing portion of such facility and the service laboratory was restored and cleared by the FDA. With respect to the analytical laboratory at our headquarters facility, any interruption in release and ongoing stability testing could have an adverse impact on our inventories needed to support our ongoing clinical activities and, if approved, commercial activities. We have obtained insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses. However, there can be no assurance that any such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property, other companies could use our technology in competitive products. Even if we obtain patents to protect our products, those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us.\nWe seek patent protection for our drug and device products and product candidates to prevent others from commercializing equivalent products in substantially less time and at substantially lower expense. The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success will depend in part on our ability, and that of parties from whom we license technology, to successfully obtain patents, defend our patents, protect our trade secrets, and otherwise prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.\nThe patent position of companies relying upon biotechnology is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. To date, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that is accorded in biotechnology patents or the degree of protection that these types of patents afford. As a result, there are risks that we may not secure proprietary rights to products or processes that appear to be patentable.\nThe parties who licensed technologies to us and we have filed various U.S. and foreign patent applications with respect to the products and technologies under our development, and the USPTO and foreign patent offices have issued patents with respect to our products and technologies. These patent applications include international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Our pending patent applications, as well as those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in the USPTO or foreign patent office issuing patents. In addition, if patent rights covering our products are not sufficiently broad, they may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products and technologies. Furthermore, even if the USPTO or foreign patent offices were to issue patents to us or our licensors, others may challenge the patents or circumvent the patents, or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents. Thus, any patents we own or license from third parties may not provide us any protection against competitors.\nThe patents that we hold have a limited life. We initially have licensed a series of patents for our KL4 surfactant technology from J&J and its wholly-owned subsidiary Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (Ortho Pharmaceutical), which have been important to our strategy of commercializing our KL4 surfactant products. These patents have all expired. However, during the course of our development activities, we have filed, and when possible and appropriate, will file, other patent applications with respect to our products and processes in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Certain of such patents related to lyophilized KL4 surfactant have issued in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere and will expire in March 2033. For our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, we hold worldwide exclusive licenses from Philip Morris USA Inc. (PMUSA) and Philip Morris Products S.A. (PMPSA) to the proprietary aerosol technology for use with pulmonary surfactants alone or in combination with other products for all respiratory diseases. Our exclusive license in the U.S. also extends to other (non-surfactant) drugs to treat certain pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions. The proprietary aerosol technology patents expire on various dates beginning in May 2016 and ending as late as 2037. We may not be able to develop enhanced or additional products or processes that will be patentable under patent law and, if we do enhance or develop additional products that we believe are patentable, additional patents may not be issued to us.\nOur technology platform consists solely of our proprietary KL4 surfactant technology, our proprietary aerosol technology, and our novel aerosol-conducting airway connector.\nOur technology platform is based on the scientific rationale of using our KL4 surfactant technology, our proprietary aerosol technology and our novel aerosol-conducting airway connector and related componentry to treat life-threatening respiratory disorders and to serve as the foundation for the development of novel respiratory therapies and products. Our business is dependent upon the successful development and approval of our drug product candidates and our combination drug-device products based on these technologies. Any material problems with our technology platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others. In certain cases, the USPTO keeps U.S. patent applications confidential while the applications are pending. As a result, we cannot determine in advance what inventions third parties may claim in their pending patent applications. We may need to defend or enforce our patent and license rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others through legal proceedings, which would be costly, unpredictable and time consuming. Even in proceedings where the outcome is favorable to us, they would likely divert substantial resources, including management time, from our other activities. Moreover, any adverse determination could subject us to significant liability or require us to seek licenses that third parties might not grant to us or might only grant at rates that diminish or deplete the profitability of our products. An adverse determination could also require us to alter our products or processes or cease altogether any product sales or related research and development activities.\nIf we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements, we could lose the rights to our products.\nWe depend on licensing agreements with third parties to maintain the intellectual property rights to our products under development. Presently, we have licensed rights from J&J, Ortho Pharmaceutical, PMUSA, PMPSA and The Scripps Institute. These agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations to maintain our rights under these licensing agreements. By their terms, all of these agreements last either throughout the life of the related patents or for a number of years after the first commercial sale of the relevant product. In addition, we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us. If we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner, we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology. Finally, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies. Licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe rely on agreements containing obligations regarding intellectual property, confidentiality and noncompetition provisions that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce.\nAlthough we take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property, including the use of agreements relating to the non-disclosure of our confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets to third parties, as well as agreements that provide for disclosure and assignment to us of all rights to the ideas, developments, improvements, discoveries and inventions of our employees, consultants, advisors and research collaborators while we employ them, such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. We generally seek to enter into these types of agreements with consultants, advisors and research collaborators; however, to the extent that such parties apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise concerning allocation of the related proprietary rights. Such disputes often involve significant expense and yield unpredictable results.\nMoreover, although all employees enter into agreements with us that include non-compete covenants, and our five senior executive officers have agreements that include broader non-competition covenants and provide for severance payments that are contingent upon the applicable employee\u2019s refraining from competition with us, such non-compete provisions can be difficult and costly to monitor and enforce, such that, if any should resign, we may not be successful in enforcing our noncompetition agreements with them.\nDespite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:\n\u2022\nagreements may be breached;\n\u2022\nagreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach;\n\u2022\nour trade secrets or proprietary know-how may otherwise become known;\n\u2022\nour competitors may independently develop similar technology; or\n\u2022\nour competitors may independently discover our proprietary information and trade secrets.\nWe depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel. If we or our strategic partners or collaborators are unable to attract and retain key personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products.\nWe have assembled a team of qualified personnel to advance the AEROSURF development program. We have competed and will continue to compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is significant and attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and any failure to do so successfully may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent upon the members of our executive management team and our directors, as well as our consultants and collaborating scientists. Many of these individuals have been involved with us for many years, have played integral roles in our progress and we believe that they continue to provide value to us. A loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business and clinical development and regulatory programs. We have entered into employment agreements with five executive officers, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and our Senior Vice President, Human Resources. The loss of services from any of our executives could significantly adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Further, we do not maintain key man life insurance.\nOur future success also will depend on the continued service of our key professional, scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit and retain additional personnel. While we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel at all levels in our organization, many of our competitors have greater resources and more experience than we do, making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel. We may experience intense competition for qualified personnel and the existence of non-competition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to lawsuits brought by their former employers.\nOur industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors, which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete.\nOur industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological innovation and evolving industry standards. We compete with numerous existing companies in many ways. We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. The development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 ease of use and cost-effectiveness involve significant technical and business risks. The success of new product offerings will depend on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economic and timely manner, and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products, adapt to changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and potential customers\u2019 requirements, our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer.\nWe intend to market our products under development for the treatment of diseases for which other technologies and treatments are rapidly developing and, consequently, we expect new companies to enter our industry and that competition in the industry will increase. Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technology personnel and managerial resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products, preclinical testing and human clinical trials management, obtaining FDA approval and other regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in receiving FDA or foreign regulatory approval or commercializing products and obtaining patent protection before us. Our competitors may successfully secure regulatory exclusivities in various markets, which could have the effect of barring us or limiting our ability to market our products in such markets.\nFor the sale of commercial products, we will compete against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities that may successfully develop and commercialize products that are more effective or less expensive than our products. In addition, developments by our competitors may render our drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe also face, and will continue to face, competition from colleges, universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations. These competitive forces frequently and aggressively seek patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for technologies that they develop. Some of these technologies may compete directly with the technologies that we are developing. These institutions will also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel. We expect that therapeutic developments in the areas in which we are active may occur at a rapid rate and that competition will intensify as advances in this field are made. As a result, we need to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to research and development activities.\nThe failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation, including securities class actions, product liability claims and patent infringement claims, could harm our financial performance and business operations.\nWe are potentially susceptible to litigation. For example, as a public company, we may be subject to securities claims based on class actions, which generally seek unquantifiable damages and attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. There can be no assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business activities, including development, manufacture and, if our products are approved, marketing of our drug products and medical devices also exposes us to liability risks. Using our drug product candidates or medical devices, including in clinical trials, may expose us to product liability claims. Even if approved, our products may be subject to claims resulting from unintended effects that result in injury or death. Product liability claims alleging inadequate disclosure and warnings in our package inserts and medical device disclosures also may arise.\nProduct liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nWe presently carry general liability, excess liability, products liability and property insurance coverage in amounts that are customary for companies in our industry of comparable size and level of activity. However, our insurance policies contain various deductibles, limitations and exclusions from coverage, and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nWe may be required to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage, including with locally-authorized insurers licensed in countries where we conduct our clinical trials, before initiating clinical trials; however, such insurance is expensive and may not be available when we need it. In the future, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance, with acceptable limits and retentions, at an acceptable cost. Any product, general liability or product liability claim, even if such claim is within the limits of our insurance coverage or meritless and/or unsuccessful, could adversely affect the availability or cost of insurance generally and our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development. In addition, such claims could result in:\n\u2022\nuninsured expenses related to defense or payment of substantial monetary awards to claimants;\n\u2022\na decrease in demand for our drug product candidates;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation; and\n\u2022\nan inability to complete clinical trial programs or to commercialize our drug product candidates, if approved.\nMoreover, the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, as the USPTO keeps U.S. patent applications confidential in certain cases while the applications are pending, we cannot ensure that our products or methods do not infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are applied for and issued, the risk increases that our patents or patent applications for our KL4 surfactant product candidates or our medical device and combination drug/device products may give rise to a declaration of interference by the USPTO, or to administrative proceedings in foreign patent offices, or that our activities lead to claims of patent infringement by other companies, institutions or individuals. These entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against us seeking to invalidate our patents, obtain substantial damages or enjoin us from conducting research and development activities.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (Certificate of Incorporation), our Amended and Restated By-Laws (By-Laws) and Delaware law could deter a change of our management and thereby discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our By-Laws and Delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management, and might discourage a third-party from offering to acquire us, even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, our Certificate of Incorporation allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our Board of Directors could issue large blocks of preferred stock or authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, before the redemption of our common stock. Such provisions may make it costlier for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination transaction with us. Provisions that have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. Moreover, our obligations to the holders of preferred stock could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. These preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of preferred stock and holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 82156, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "WINT"}
