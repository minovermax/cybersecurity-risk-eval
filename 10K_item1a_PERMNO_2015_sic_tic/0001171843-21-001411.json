You should carefully read this entire report and consider the following uncertainties and risks, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, along with all of the other information included in our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to buy our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nRisks Relating to COVID-19\nOur business, operations, clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, and access to capital could be adversely affected by the effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic on us or on third parties with whom we conduct business, including without limitation our development partners, manufacturers, clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), and others, as well as on the regulatory and government agencies with whom we work.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has spread to multiple countries around the world, is affecting the United States and global economies, and may cause significant disruptions to our business, operations, and clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, as well as the business and operations of third parties with whom we conduct business. For example, quarantines, shelter-in-place, similar government orders and evolving business policies and procedures have impacted and may continue to impact, among other things: (1) our personnel and those of third parties on whom we rely, including our development partners (such as Torii), manufacturers, CROs, and others; (2) the conduct of our current and future clinical trials and commercial interactions; and (3) the operations of the FDA, EMA, PMDA and other health and governmental authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals.\nIf our operations or those of third parties with whom we conduct business are impaired or curtailed as a result of these events, the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be stopped or delayed, or the costs of such development and commercialization activities could increase, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, if interruptions related to COVID-19 were to impair our or Torii\u2019s ability to perform under the Torii Agreement to complete our regulatory interactions in Japan, including with respect to the pending approval of a reimbursement price for ORLADEYO for the treatment of HAE, then the timing and success of our development and commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan could be severely impacted.\nOur suppliers or other vendors may be unable to meet their obligations to us or perform their services as expected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics. In such circumstances, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative suppliers or vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Such delays could adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development and any future commercialization timelines. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our suppliers and vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the acceleration of COVID-19 slowed startup of the inadequate C5 responder cohorts in our complement oral Factor D inhibitor program and, as a result, delayed the reporting of related data. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic or concerns among patients about participating in clinical trials during a pandemic. Some patients may have difficulty following certain aspects of clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our inability to successfully recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 or experience additional restrictions by their institutions, city, or state could adversely impact our clinical trial operations.\nIf global health concerns prevent the FDA, EMA, PMDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA, EMA, PMDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and clinical development plans and timelines.\nWe have implemented work-from-home policies for our employees, which may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may also materially affect our access to capital. While the future economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access the equity or debt capital markets or obtain other sources of capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. These effects could be material, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. We do not yet know the full extent and magnitude of the impacts that COVID-19 has had or will have on our business, on the healthcare system, or on the global economy. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\nFinancial and Liquidity Risks\nWe have incurred losses since our inception, expect to continue to incur such losses, and may never be profitable.\nSince our inception, we have not achieved sustained profitability. We expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future, and our losses could increase as our research and development efforts and commercial activities progress. We expect that such losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that losses and fluctuations may be substantial. To become profitable, we, or our collaborative partners, must successfully manufacture and develop product candidates, receive regulatory approval, and successfully commercialize our products and/or enter into profitable commercialization arrangements with other parties. It could take longer than expected before we receive, or we may never receive, significant revenue from any current or future license agreements or significant revenues directly from product sales. Even if we are able to successfully commercialize our existing products, or to develop new commercially viable products, certain obligations we have to third parties, including, without limitation, our obligation to pay RPI royalties on certain ORLADEYO and BCX9930 revenues under the Royalty Purchase Agreement, may reduce the profitability of such products.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our product candidates, launching new products, and their potential for commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may need to adjust our operations.\nWe have sustained operating losses for the majority of our corporate history and expect that our 2021 expenses will exceed our 2021 revenues. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows until revenues reach a level sufficient to support ongoing operations.\nOur liquidity needs will be largely determined by the success of operations in regard to the commercialization of our products and the progression of our product candidates in the future. Our plans for managing our liquidity needs primarily include controlling the timing and spending on our research and development programs, raising additional funds through equity financings, and commercializing our approved products. We also may consider other plans to fund operations including: (1) securing or increasing U.S. Government funding of our programs, including obtaining additional and delivering on procurement contracts; (2) out-licensing rights to certain of our products or product candidates, pursuant to which we would receive cash milestone payments and/or royalties; (3) raising additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources, including royalty or other monetization transactions; (4) obtaining additional product candidate regulatory approvals, which would generate revenue, milestones and cash flow; (5) reducing spending on research and development programs, including by discontinuing and suspending development; and/or (6) restructuring operations to change our overhead structure.\nThere can be no assurance that any of our plans will be successful or that additional capital will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all, when needed. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital, we may be forced to adjust or curtail our operations; delay, reduce, or stop ongoing clinical trials or commercialization efforts; cease operations altogether; or file for bankruptcy.\nRisks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization\nOur success depends upon our ability to advance our product candidates through the various stages of development, especially through the clinical trial process, and to receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our product candidates.\nTo receive the regulatory approvals necessary for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we or our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that each product candidate is safe and effective. The development process and related regulatory process are complex and uncertain. The preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of drug development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy and safety, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or medically or commercially unacceptable, our or our partners\u2019 failure to comply with trial protocols, applicable regulatory requirements, and industry standards, or a determination by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority that a product candidate may not continue development or be approved in accordance with our development plans or at all. We cannot guarantee that any preclinical studies and clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all, or that the results of such trials will be sufficient to support regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nProgression of our product candidates through the clinical development process is dependent upon our trials indicating that our product candidates have adequate safety and efficacy in the patients being treated by achieving pre-determined safety and efficacy endpoints according to the clinical trial protocols. Failure to achieve any of these endpoints in any of our programs, including BCX9930, BCX9250, galidesivir, and our other rare disease product candidates, could result in delays in or modifications to our trials or require the performance of additional unplanned trials. If any of our product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Product candidates that initially show promise in clinical or preclinical testing could later be found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that could result in delays in the development of our product candidates, significant unexpected costs, or the termination of programs. The development plans for our product candidates, including our clinical trials, may not be adequately designed or executed, which could negatively affect the outcome and analysis of study results. Because of the cost and duration of clinical trials, we may decide to discontinue development of product candidates that are unlikely to show favorable results in clinical trials, unlikely to help advance a product to the point of a meaningful collaboration, or unlikely to have reasonable commercial potential.\nUndesirable or inconclusive data in our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials or side effects in humans could result in the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities (including, e.g., the EMA, the MHLW or the MHRA) refusing to approve a product candidate for any targeted indications or imposing restrictions or warnings that could impact development or the ultimate commercial viability of a product candidate. In addition, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may determine that study data from our product candidates necessitates additional studies or study designs which differ from our planned development strategy, and such regulatory authorities may also require patient monitoring and testing or may implement restrictions or other conditions on our development activities, any of which could materially impact the cost and timing of our planned development strategy. We, our partners, the FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks.\nOur ability to successfully complete the clinical development process is dependent upon many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf our or our partners\u2019 ability to secure suitable clinical sites and investigators and to enroll and maintain an adequate number of patients on a timely basis or at all;\n\u25cf patients that enroll in a clinical trial may not comply with the clinical trial protocol or maintain contact with investigators to provide complete data during and after treatment;\n\u25cf our product candidates may not prove to be either safe or effective or may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results;\n\u25cf we or our partners may decide, or be required by regulatory authorities, to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate, noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their standards of conduct, or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar product or product candidate;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may disagree with our or our partners\u2019 clinical trial protocols or our or their interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf clinical protocols or study procedures may not be adequately designed or followed by the investigators;\n\u25cf formulation improvements may not work as expected, which could negatively impact commercial demand for our product candidates;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or our partners enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf the supply or quantity of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct development activities may be insufficient, inadequate, or unavailable at an acceptable cost, and we or our partners may experience interruptions in supply;\n\u25cf our or our partners\u2019 development plans may be delayed or changed as a result of changes in development strategy, the impact of new or different regulations, requirements, and guidelines, or other unexpected events or conditions;\n\u25cf the cost of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf we or our third-party contractors, including those manufacturing our product candidates or components or ingredients thereof, or conducting clinical trials or laboratory testing on our or our partners\u2019 behalf, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards or meet contractual obligations in a timely manner or at all; and\n\u25cf the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on one or more of the foregoing factors.\nClinical trials are lengthy and expensive. Many of the factors listed above could result in increased clinical development costs or longer clinical development times for any of our programs. We or our partners incur substantial expense for, and devote significant time to, preclinical testing and clinical trials, yet we cannot be certain that the tests and trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product. Even if we or our partners successfully complete clinical trials for our product candidates, we or our partners might not file the required regulatory submissions in a timely manner, may not receive regulatory approval for the product candidates, in which case we would be unable to generate any revenues from product sales or licensing arrangements, or any product candidate, if approved, may be subject to restrictions on labeling, marketing, distribution, prescribing, and use, which could adversely impact the sales of such product.\nIf our development collaborations with third parties, such as our development partners, contractors and contract research organizations, fail, the development of our product candidates will be delayed or stopped.\nWe rely heavily upon third parties for many important stages of our product candidate development, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf discovery of natural proteins that cause or enable biological reactions necessary for the progression of the disease or disorder, called enzyme targets;\n\u25cf execution of certain pharmacology preclinical studies and late-stage development for our compounds and product candidates;\n\u25cf management of our phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials, including medical monitoring, laboratory testing, and data management;\n\u25cf execution of toxicology studies that may be required to obtain approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf formulation improvement strategies and methods;\n\u25cf manufacturing the starting materials and drug substance required to formulate our products and the product candidates to be used in our clinical trials, toxicology studies and any potential commercial product; and\n\u25cf management of certain regulatory interactions outside of the United States.\nOur failure to engage in successful collaborations at any one of these stages would greatly impact our business. If we do not license enzyme targets or inhibitors from academic institutions or from other biotechnology companies on acceptable terms, our drug development efforts would suffer. Similarly, if the contract research organizations or third-party contractors that conduct our initial or late-stage clinical trials, conduct our toxicology or other studies, manufacture our starting materials, drug substance and product candidates, provide laboratory testing or other services in connection with our clinical trials, or assist with our regulatory function breach their obligations to us, perform their services inconsistent with industry standards, or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, this would delay or prevent both the development of our product candidates and the availability of any potential commercial product.\nIf we lose our relationship with any one or more of these parties, we could experience a significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its services. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we locate an alternative provider, it is likely that this provider may need additional time to respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of service as the original provider. In addition, any provider that we retain will be subject to applicable FDA current Good Laboratory Practices, current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) and current Good Clinical Practices, and comparable foreign standards. We do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. If any of the foregoing risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to obtain additional financing or acceptable partnership arrangements, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates or continue operations.\nAs our programs advance, our costs are likely to increase. Our current and planned discovery, development, approval, and commercialization efforts will require significant capital. Our expenses, revenues and cash utilization rate could vary significantly depending on many factors, including: our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, including BCX9930, BCX9250, and galidesivir; our ability to maintain regulatory approval for, successfully commercialize, and achieve market acceptance of our products, including ORLADEYO; our ability to raise additional capital; the amount of funding we receive from partnerships with third parties for the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates (including our collaborations with Torii, BARDA/HHS, and NIAID/HHS); the commercial success of our products achieved by our partners; the amount or profitability of any orders for peramivir or galidesivir by any government agency or other party; the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our product candidates; and the progress made in the manufacture of our lead products and the progression of our other programs.\nIn order to continue future operations, progress our drug development programs, and commercialize our current products and product candidates, we will be required to raise additional capital. In addition to seeking strategic partnerships, transactions and government funding, we may access the equity or debt markets, incur additional borrowings, or seek other sources of funding to meet liquidity needs at any time. Additional funding, whether through additional sales of securities, additional borrowings, royalty or other monetization transactions, collaborative arrangements with partners, including corporate partners such as Torii and governmental agencies such as BARDA/HHS or NIAID/HHS, or from other sources, may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities, with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of our currently outstanding common stock, could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. Additional borrowings may subject us to more restrictive covenants than are currently applicable to us under our Credit Agreement (as defined under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Overview -- Recent Corporate Highlights -- Financing Transactions\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report). In addition, collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners. Insufficient funds or lack of an acceptable partnership may require us to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs.\nOur ability to raise additional capital when needed or at all may be limited and may greatly depend upon our success in commercializing and achieving market acceptance of ORLADEYO and the success of our current drug development programs, including the progress, timeline and ultimate outcome of the development programs (including but not limited to formulation progress, long-term human safety studies, and carcinogenicity, drug-drug interaction, toxicity, or other required studies) for BCX9250 for the treatment of FOP, BCX9930 for diseases of the complement system, our broad-spectrum antiviral program, including galidesivir, and other rare disease product candidates, as well as any post-approval studies for our products. In addition, constriction and volatility in the equity and debt markets, including as a result of the impacts of COVID-19, may restrict our future flexibility to raise capital when such needs arise. Furthermore, we have exposure to many different industries, financing partners and counterparties, including commercial banks, investment banks and partners (which include investors, licensing partners, and the U.S. Government) which may be unstable or may become unstable in the current economic and political environment, including as a result of the impacts of COVID-19. Any such instability may impact these parties\u2019 ability to fulfill contractual obligations to us or they might limit or place burdensome conditions upon future transactions with us. Also, it is possible that suppliers may be negatively impacted. Any such unfavorable outcomes in our current programs or unfavorable economic conditions could place severe downward pressure on the price of our common stock and may decrease opportunities to raise capital in the capital or credit markets, and further could reduce the return available on invested corporate cash, which, if severe and sustained, could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows and limit our ability to continue development and commercialization of our products and product candidates.\nIf we or our partners do not obtain governmental approval for our product candidates or maintain governmental approval for our products, we or our partners will not be able to commercialize and sell these products and potential products, which would significantly harm our business because we will receive no revenue.\nWe or our partners must obtain regulatory approval before marketing or selling our products. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority delays or denies regulatory approval of one of our product candidates, or revokes approval of a previously approved product, we would be unable to market or sell the product in the applicable jurisdiction and would not receive revenue from sales or licensing arrangements related thereto, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nThe process of preparing for and obtaining regulatory approval in any jurisdiction may be lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. Because of the risks and uncertainties inherent to the development process, including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of COVID-19, our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval. As discussed under \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization-Our success depends upon our ability to advance our products through the various stages of development, especially through the clinical trial process, and to receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our products,\u201d we or our partners may experience any number of unfavorable outcomes during or as a result of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates, or negatively impact our management\u2019s credibility, our value and our operating results.\nEven if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve a product candidate, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product candidate, impose other restrictions on the product candidate, and/or may require post-approval studies that could impair the commercial viability of a product candidate. If we receive approval to market our potential products, whether in the United States or internationally, we will continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. These requirements are wide ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u25cf\nadverse drug experience reporting regulations;\n\u25cf\nproduct promotion;\n\u25cf\nproduct manufacturing, including good manufacturing practice requirements; and\n\u25cf\nproduct changes or modifications.\nOur failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements for regulatory approval, or our loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals, could impair our ability to generate any revenues from product sales or licensing arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe focus on rare diseases, which may create additional risks and challenges.\nBecause we focus on developing drugs as treatments for rare diseases, we may seek orphan drug, breakthrough therapy or fast track designations for our product candidates in the United States or the equivalent designations elsewhere in the world. Often, regulatory authorities have broad discretion in determining whether or not to grant such designations. We cannot guarantee that our product candidates will receive orphan drug status from the FDA or equivalent designations from other regulatory authorities. We also cannot guarantee that we will receive breakthrough therapy, fast track, or equivalent designations, which provide certain potential benefits such as more frequent meetings with the applicable regulatory authorities to discuss development plans, intensive guidance on efficient drug development programs, and potential eligibility for rolling review or priority review. Even if we are successful in obtaining any such designations for our product candidates, such designations may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval and do not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. For instance, although BCX9930 for PNH has received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA, and ORLADEYO has a Promising Innovative Medicine designation from the MHRA, as well as orphan drug status from the EMA, we may not experience a faster development, review or approval process compared to the conventional process in the relevant jurisdictions. We may not be able to obtain or maintain these designations for ORLADEYO, BCX9930 or other product candidates that receive them, and our competitors may obtain these designations for their product candidates, which could impact our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or compete with such competitors, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe commercial viability of any approved product could be compromised if the product is less effective than expected, causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, or fails to achieve market acceptance within the medical community.\nIf, after obtaining regulatory approval of a product, we or others discover that it is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of, or impose marketing or manufacturing restrictions on, the product, or require us or our partners to create a medication guide outlining the risks of unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf we or our partners may be required to recall the product, change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials, or be subject to civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u25cf the product may become less competitive and our reputation may suffer.\nEven after receiving regulatory approval, any product could fail to gain sufficient, or even any, market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors, health authorities and others in the medical community. For example, physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments enter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due to lack of reimbursement for existing therapies. If an approved product does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, it may not generate significant revenues. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nIf we fail to successfully commercialize or establish collaborative relationships to commercialize certain of our products and product candidates, or if any partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us, potential revenues from commercialization of our products and product candidates could be reduced, delayed or eliminated.\nOur business strategy is to increase the asset value of our product candidate portfolio. We believe this is best achieved by retaining full product rights or through collaborative arrangements with third parties as appropriate. As needed, potential third-party relationships could include preclinical development, clinical development, regulatory approval, marketing, sales, and distribution of our products and product candidates.\nCurrently, we have established collaborative relationships with Torii for the commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan, with each of Shionogi and Green Cross for the development and commercialization of peramivir, and with Mundipharma for the development and commercialization of Mundesine (forodesine). The process of establishing and implementing collaborative relationships is difficult, time-consuming and involves significant uncertainty, including:\n\u25cf our partners may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory commercial, regulatory or clinical results, including post approval clinical commitments, a change in business strategy, a change of control or other reasons;\n\u25cf our contracts for collaborative arrangements may expire;\n\u25cf our partners may choose to pursue alternative technologies, including those of our competitors;\n\u25cf we may have disputes with a partner that could lead to litigation or arbitration, such as the recent arbitration proceeding between us and SUL, which could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of our management;\n\u25cf we do not have day-to-day control over the activities of our partners and have limited control over their decisions;\n\u25cf our ability to generate future event payments and royalties from our partners depends upon their abilities to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and achieve market acceptance of products developed from our product candidates;\n\u25cf we or our partners may fail to properly initiate, maintain or defend our intellectual property rights, where applicable, or a party may utilize our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or potentially invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u25cf we or our partners may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our products and product candidates; and\n\u25cf we or our partners may not comply with applicable government regulatory requirements.\nIf we or our partners fail to fulfill our responsibilities in a timely manner, or at all, our commercialization efforts related to that collaboration could be reduced, delayed or terminated, or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our partner. If we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms, we may have to delay or discontinue further development or commercialization of one or more of our products or product candidates, undertake commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of funding. Any delay in the development or commercialization of our products and product candidates would severely affect our business, because if our product candidates do not progress through the development process or reach the market in a timely manner, or at all, we may not receive any revenues from product sales or licensing arrangements.\nThe results of our partnership with Torii may not meet our current expectations.\nWe have an agreement with Torii for the development and commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan. We do not have a history of working with Torii and cannot predict the success of this collaboration. Our ability to realize the expected benefits of this collaboration, including with respect to the receipt or amounts of potential milestone or royalty payments, is subject to a number of risks, including that applicable regulatory agencies may not provide reimbursement approvals on a timely basis or at all, the commercial potential of ORLADEYO may not meet our current expectations, we or Torii may fail to comply with our respective obligations under the Torii Agreement, and third parties may fail to perform their obligations to us on a timely basis or at all.\nThe Torii Agreement provides for a potential milestone payment upon receipt of a reimbursement price approval from Japan\u2019s National Health Insurance system in excess of the threshold specified in the Torii Agreement, which we may not receive on a timely basis or at all. The Torii Agreement also provides that we will be entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, the amounts of which will depend upon the amount of annual net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year and other factors. We remain responsible for regulatory activities with respect to ORLADEYO in Japan for one year after the first commercial sale. We expect to use third parties to satisfy many of our obligations under the Torii Agreement, including but not limited to our regulatory and other responsibilities in Japan. If our interactions, or those of our third party agents, are unsuccessful, we could fail to meet our obligations under the Torii Agreement, fail to receive reimbursement authorization in excess of the specified threshold, which could negatively impact the commercial success and the partnership, impact the economic benefit expected or require additional development of ORLADEYO.\nTorii may terminate the Torii Agreement under certain limited circumstances, including upon one year\u2019s written notice after the sixth anniversary of the first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan. If the Torii Agreement is terminated in connection with these provisions, we will no longer be entitled to receive any milestone or royalty payments thereunder, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nTorii will have sole control over and decision-making authority with respect to commercialization activities for ORLADEYO for the prevention of HAE attacks in Japan, subject to oversight from a joint steering committee. Therefore, our receipt of, and the amounts of, any royalty payments under the Torii Agreement are dependent upon Torii\u2019s successful performance of such commercialization activities. In addition, competitive products and variations in patient demand, prescription levels, reimbursement determinations or other factors may limit the commercial potential of ORLADEYO in Japan, which could materially reduce the amount of any royalties we would be entitled to receive under the Torii Agreement.\nUnder the Torii Agreement, we will be responsible for supplying Torii with its required amounts of ORLADEYO for commercial sale. If, due to the failure of our third-party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient drug product, we fail to supply to Torii the required amounts of ORLADEYO, then Torii\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize ORLADEYO in Japan could be materially impaired, and we may receive less royalty income under the Torii Agreement, or none at all.\nAny of the foregoing risks could materially adversely impact our ability to obtain reimbursement price approval for ORLADEYO in Japan and to perform our obligations under the Torii Agreement, which could materially reduce the economic benefits of the Torii Agreement to us and impair or result in the termination of our collaboration with Torii.\nThere can be no assurance that our commercialization efforts, methods, and strategies for our products or technologies will succeed, and our future revenue generation is uncertain.\nThere can be no assurance that our commercialization efforts, methods and strategies will succeed. Although we have expanded and added experienced professionals to our internal commercial team, as a company we do not have a great deal of experience in commercializing our product candidates or technologies. In addition, we may be unable to establish or sufficiently increase our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for products we currently, or plan to, commercialize. Our ability to receive revenue from products we or our partners commercialize is subject to several risks, including:\n\u25cf we or our partners may fail to successfully complete clinical trials, or satisfy post-marketing commitments, sufficient to obtain and keep regulatory agency marketing approval;\n\u25cf many competitors are more experienced and have significantly more resources, and their products could reach the market faster, be more cost effective or have a better efficacy or tolerability profile than our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf we may fail to employ a comprehensive and effective intellectual property strategy, which could result in decreased commercial value of our Company and our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf we may fail to employ a comprehensive and effective regulatory strategy, which could result in a delay or failure in commercialization of our products;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully commercialize our products is affected by the competitive landscape, which cannot be fully known at this time;\n\u25cf revenue from product sales would depend on our ability to obtain and maintain favorable pricing;\n\u25cf reimbursement is constantly changing, which could greatly affect usage of our products;\n\u25cf future revenue from product sales would depend on our ability to successfully complete clinical studies, obtain regulatory approvals, and manufacture, market, distribute and commercialize our approved drugs; and\n\u25cf the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us or our partners.\nEven if we are able to successfully commercialize our existing products, or to develop new commercially viable products, certain obligations we have to third parties, including, without limitation, our obligations to pay royalties on certain ORLADEYO and BCX9930 revenues under the Royalty Purchase Agreement may reduce the profitability of such products.\nWe expect to continue expanding our development and regulatory capabilities and implementing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to continue experiencing significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, sales, marketing, and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. For example, we expanded our internal commercial team in 2020 in preparation for the commercial launch of ORLADEYO. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. In addition, if a commercial launch for any product or product candidate for which we recruit a commercial team and establish marketing capabilities in any region is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe depend on third-party vendors in the manufacture and distribution of our products, product candidates and the materials for our product candidates. If we cannot rely on existing third-party vendors, we will be required to incur significant costs and potential delays in finding new third-party vendors, which could adversely impact the development and commercialization timeframes for our products and product candidates.\nWe depend on third-party vendors, including third-party manufacturers, distributors, and specialty pharmacies, in the manufacture and distribution of our products, product candidates, and the materials for our product candidates. Often, especially in the early development and commercialization process, we have only one or limited sources for a particular product or service, such as manufacturing and/or distribution. We depend on these third-party vendors to perform their obligations in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable governmental regulations. Our third-party vendors, particularly our third-party manufacturers and distributors, which may be the only vendor we have engaged for a particular product or service, may encounter difficulties with meeting our requirements, including but not limited to problems involving, as applicable:\n\u25cf insufficient resources being devoted in the manner necessary to satisfy our requirements within expected timeframes;\n\u25cf inconsistent production yields;\n\u25cf product liability claims or recalls of commercial product;\n\u25cf difficulties in scaling production to commercial and validation sizes;\n\u25cf interruption of the delivery of materials required for the manufacturing process;\n\u25cf failure to distribute commercial supplies of our products to commercial vendors or end users in a timely manner;\n\u25cf scheduling of plant time with other vendors or unexpected equipment failure;\n\u25cf potential catastrophes that could strike their facilities or have an effect on infrastructure;\n\u25cf potential impurities in our drug substance or products that could affect availability of product for our clinical trials or future commercialization;\n\u25cf poor quality control and assurance or inadequate process controls;\n\u25cf failure to provide us with accurate or timely information regarding inventories, the number of patients who are using our products, or serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products;\n\u25cf inability of third parties to satisfy their financial obligations to us or to others;\n\u25cf potential breach of the manufacturing or distribution agreement by the third party;\n\u25cf possible termination or nonrenewal of a critical agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us; and\n\u25cf lack of compliance or cooperation with regulations and specifications or requests set forth by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies or local customs, particularly associated with ORLADEYO, BCX9930, BCX9250, galidesivir, peramivir and our early stage compounds.\nMany additional factors could cause production or distribution interruptions with the manufacture and distribution of any of our products and product candidates, including human error, natural disasters, pandemics, labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war, equipment malfunctions, or raw material shortages. If our commercial distribution partners are not able to satisfy our requirements within the expected timeframe, or are unable to provide us with accurate or timely information and data, including inventories and sales, serious adverse events, and/or product complaints, our business, including our commercial launch and sales of ORLADEYO may be at risk. In addition, if specialty pharmacy services, including our third-party call center services, which provide patient support and financial services, prescription intake and distribution, reimbursement adjudication, and ongoing compliance support is not effectively managed, the continuance of our commercial launch and sales of ORLADEYO may be delayed or compromised.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture the materials required for our product candidates at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable. Our raw materials, drug substances, and product candidates are manufactured by a limited group of suppliers, including some at a single facility. If any of these suppliers were unable to produce these items, this could significantly impact our supply of product candidate material for further preclinical testing and clinical trials. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements, but they may not continue to do so. Furthermore, changes in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the drug is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, may require prior review and approval in accordance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP and comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a product. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may at any time implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards, for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to comply, we or they may be subject to regulatory action, civil actions or penalties any of which could be costly to us and could result in a delay or shortage of product.\nIf we are unable to maintain current third-party relationships, or enter into new agreements with additional third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or if there is poor manufacturing or distribution performance or failure to comply with any regulatory agency on the part of any of our third-party vendors, we may not be able to complete development of, obtain timely approval of, or commercialize, our products and product candidates.\nCommercialization of our products by us and our partners is subject to the potential commercialization risks described herein and numerous additional risks. Any potential revenue benefits to us, including in the form of milestone payments, royalties or other consideration are highly speculative.\nCommercialization success of our products is uncertain and is subject to all the risks and uncertainties disclosed in our other risk factors relating to drug development and commercialization. In addition, commercialization of our products is subject to further risks and may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf our products may not prove to be adequately safe and effective for market approval in markets other than the markets in which they are currently approved;\n\u25cf necessary funding for post-marketing commitments and further development of our products may not be available timely, at all, or in sufficient amounts;\n\u25cf advances in competing products could substantially replace potential demand for our products;\n\u25cf government and third-party payors may not provide sufficient coverage or reimbursement which would negatively impact the demand for our products;\n\u25cf we may not be able to supply commercial material to our partners and our partners may not be able to maintain or establish sufficient and acceptable commercial manufacturing, either directly or through third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf the commercial demand and acceptance for our products by healthcare providers and by patients may not be sufficient to result in substantial product revenues to our partners and may result in little to no milestones or royalties to us;\n\u25cf effectiveness of marketing and commercialization efforts for our products by our partners;\n\u25cf market satisfaction with existing alternative therapies;\n\u25cf perceived efficacy relative to other available therapies;\n\u25cf disease prevalence;\n\u25cf cost of treatment;\n\u25cf pricing and availability of alternative products;\n\u25cf marketing and sales activities of competitors;\n\u25cf shifts in the medical community to new treatment paradigms or standards of care; and\n\u25cf relative convenience and ease of administration.\nRisks Relating to Competing in Our Industry\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our products may be reduced.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change. There are many companies seeking to develop products for the same indications that we currently target. Our competitors in the United States and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies and specialized biotechnology firms. Most of these competitors have greater resources than we do, including greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and more experienced manufacturing, marketing, and sales organizations. In addition, most of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting clinical trials and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals of product candidates more rapidly than we do or for products that compete with our products. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals, and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do may achieve a significant competitive advantage, including patent and FDA exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market products. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the commercialization of our products, licensing of potential product candidates for desirable disease targets, licensing of desirable product candidates, and development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Competition may also arise from, among other things:\n\u25cf\nother drug development technologies;\n\u25cf\nmethods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease, including vaccines; and\n\u25cf\nnew small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents.\nDevelopments by others may render our products, product candidates, or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe received FDA approval of ORLADEYO, an oral, once-daily therapy for the prevention of HAE, in December 2020. In addition, we are performing research on or developing products for the treatment of several other rare diseases, including diseases of the complement system and FOP, as well as developing broad spectrum antivirals for use as medical countermeasures. We expect to encounter significant competition for our pharmaceutical products and product candidates. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required funding or government support, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales or stockpiling orders of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. There are licensed therapies for HAE (including Berinert\u00ae, Haegarda\u00ae, Cinryze\u00ae, Kalbitor\u00ae, Takhzyro\u00ae, Firazyr\u00ae (icatibant), generic icatibant, and Ruconest\u00ae), therapies for certain complement-mediated diseases such as PNH, aHUS, myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (Soliris\u00ae and UltomirisTM), products for the prevention or treatment of influenza (seasonal flu vaccines, Tamiflu\u00ae (oseltamivir), generic oseltamivir, Relenza\u00ae, and Inavir\u00ae, favipiravir, and Xofluza\u2122), and a number of additional products in clinical development in these therapeutic areas and for the treatment of FOP. In addition, various government entities throughout the world may offer incentives, grants and contracts to encourage additional investment into preventative and therapeutic agents against viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, Ebola, and others, which may have the effect of further increasing the number of our competitors and/or providing advantages to certain competitors. See \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of our competitors, competitive products or programs, and the competitive conditions in these and other therapeutic areas.\nIf one or more of our competitors\u2019 products or programs, including potential competitors not currently identified, are successful, the market for our products may be reduced or eliminated.\nCompared to us, many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u25cf\ncapital resources;\n\u25cf\nresearch and development resources, including personnel and technology;\n\u25cf\nregulatory experience;\n\u25cf\npreclinical study and clinical testing experience;\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing, marketing, and sales experience; and\n\u25cf\nproduction facilities.\nAny of these competitive factors could impede our funding efforts, render our products, product candidates, or technologies noncompetitive or eliminate or reduce demand for our products and product candidates.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations related to our products and product candidates and, if we or our partners do not comply with these laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur or our partners\u2019 activities related to approved products or, following their regulatory approval, any of our product candidates under development, such as BCX9930, BCX9250, and galidesivir, are subject to regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States (including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, and state and local governments) and their foreign equivalents (including the EMA, MHLW, MHRA, and others).\nWe are responsible for reporting adverse drug experiences, have responsibility for certain post-approval studies, and may have responsibilities and costs related to a recall or withdrawal of our products from sale in the jurisdictions in which they are approved. We may also incur liability associated with product manufacturing contracted by us or in support of any of our partners. We are required to maintain records and provide data and reports to regulatory agencies related to our products (e.g. risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, track and trace requirements, adverse events), and we may incur certain promotional regulatory and government pricing risks, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. Similar responsibilities would apply upon regulatory approval of any of our other product candidates currently under development.\nIn addition, we are subject to the federal physician sunshine act and certain similar physician payment and drug pricing transparency legislation in various states. We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care \u201cfraud and abuse,\u201d including both federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws. Outside of the United States, we may be subject to analogous foreign laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations apply to our or our partners\u2019 operations, sales and marketing practices, price reporting, and relationships with physicians and other customers and third-party payors. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursement or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The sunshine provisions apply to manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government certain payments made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as, ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Although we seek to comply with these statutes, it is possible that our practices, or those of our partners, might be challenged under health care fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims or similar laws. Violations of the physician sunshine act and similar legislation or the fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and future exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nThe principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to certain regulatory authorities, including the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Consequently, the FDA or other regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator creates a conflict of interest or otherwise affects interpretation of the study. In the event of a conflict of interest with respect to a study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned or the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.\nWe have a number of outstanding post-approval commitments to the FDA and EMA that we retain, which we may not complete successfully or on time for any number of reasons, including but not limited to lack of funds to complete the studies and insufficient interest by appropriate sites, investigators or study subjects. For example, as a condition of the approval of RAPIVAB, we were required to complete pediatric patient trials and to submit the final results of these clinical trials to the FDA and EMA. We may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with post-approval legal and regulatory requirements, and our products could be subject to continual recordkeeping and reporting requirements, review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Regulatory approval of a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the other restrictive conditions of approval that limit our ability to promote, sell or distribute a product. Furthermore, the approval of our products and any other future product candidates may be subject to requirements for costly post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor its safety or efficacy.\nAdvertising and promotion are subject to stringent FDA rules and oversight, and as an NDA-holder, we may be held responsible for any advertising and promotion that is not in compliance with the rules and regulations. In particular, the claims in all promotional materials and activities must be consistent with the FDA approvals for approved products and must be appropriately substantiated and fairly balanced with information on the safety risks and limitations of the products. We are also required to engage in appropriate truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning our products, and applicable regulatory authorities, competitors, and other third parties may take the position that we are not in compliance with such regulations. In addition to medical education efforts, we may offer patient support services to assist patients receiving treatment with our commercially approved products which have increasingly become the focus of government investigation.\nAdverse event information concerning approved products must be reviewed, and as an NDA-holder, we are required to make expedited and periodic adverse event reports to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, state and local governments, and foreign equivalents of the foregoing. All of these activities are also potentially subject to healthcare false claims and fraud and abuse laws, as well as consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\nIf our operations with respect to our products that are subject to healthcare laws and regulations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with all applicable fraud and abuse laws may be costly.\nOur employees and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees and consultants, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee and consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and consultant misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe and our partners may be subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals and healthcare payor initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to market our products, obtain collaborators and raise capital.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the U.S. The PPACA included numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies, some of which became effective immediately and others of which have taken effect over the past several years. For example, the PPACA expanded health care coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The PPACA also imposed substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit, an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the U.S., and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics. The PPACA also contains cost containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for health care items and services generally, including pharmaceuticals. It also required reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce costs of health care could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose certain payments and transfers of value to, and investment interests held by, physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Compliance with the PPACA and state laws with similar provisions is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the pharmaceutical industry. For example, legislation has been enacted in certain states and at a federal level that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. Compliance with these electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. In addition, our compliance may be deemed insufficient and we could face a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. As a result of these and other new proposals, we may determine to change our current manner of operation, provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdequate coverage and reimbursement in the U.S. and other markets is critical to the commercial success of our approved products. Recently in the U.S. there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have been increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and, in some cases, imposing restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Many third-party payors negotiate the price of medical services and products and develop formularies which establish pricing and reimbursement levels. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the third-party payor\u2019s patient population. The process for obtaining coverage can be lengthy and costly, and we expect that it could take several months before a particular payor initially reviews our product and makes a decision with respect to coverage. For example, third-party payors may require cost-benefit analysis data from us in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products or any other product we might bring to market. For any individual third-party payor, we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain reimbursement on a similar or preferred basis to competitive products, or at all which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to data security and privacy risks, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection could harm our business.\nWe are subject to legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use, and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. For example, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, which gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. We are also subject to the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU. See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business-Risks Relating to International Operations-Our actual or perceived failure to comply with European governmental regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could harm our business\u201d in this section for additional discussion of international privacy laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions, private litigation, or harm to our reputation and our business.\nIf because of our use of hazardous materials, we violate any environmental controls or regulations that apply to such materials, we may incur substantial costs and expenses in our remediation efforts.\nOur research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and some waste products. Accidental contamination or injury from these materials could occur. In the event of an accident, we could be liable for any damages that result, and any liabilities could exceed our resources. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations or a violation of such environmental laws and regulations could require us to incur substantial unexpected costs, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of those rights would diminish.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our partners to obtain, protect and enforce viable intellectual property rights including but not limited to trade name, trademark and patent protection for our Company and its products, methods, processes and other technologies we may license or develop, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties both domestically and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation. Neither the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), the Patent Cooperation Treaty offices, nor the courts of the United States and other jurisdictions have consistent policies nor predictable rulings regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Further, we may not have worldwide patent protection for all of our product candidates and our intellectual property rights may not be legally protected or enforceable in all countries throughout the world. In some jurisdictions, some of our product candidates in certain programs, including our HAE program, may have short or no composition of matter patent life and we may therefore rely on orphan drug exclusivity or data exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will obtain orphan drug exclusivity or data exclusivity in every jurisdiction. Further, in some jurisdictions, we may rely on formulation patents or method of use patents. Both the ability to achieve issuance and the enforcement of formulation and method of use patents can be highly uncertain and can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and such patents may therefore not adequately prevent competitors and potential infringers in some jurisdictions. The validity, scope, enforceability and commercial value of the rights protected by such patents, therefore, is highly uncertain.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborators and advisors, our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be imperiled.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our partners or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and unsuccessful. An adverse result in any legal proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk. Our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties\u2019 patents and other intellectual property rights as well as avoiding the breach of any licenses relating to our technologies and products. In the United States, patent applications filed in recent years are confidential for 18 months, while older applications are not published until the patent issues. As a result, avoiding patent infringement may be difficult and we may inadvertently infringe third-party patents or proprietary rights. These third parties could bring claims against us, our partners or our licensors that even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if resolved against us, could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, our partners or our licensors, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of any infringing product in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe, unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with the infringing product. Even if we, our partners or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.\nIf we or our partners are unable or fail to adequately initiate, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights in any area of commercial interest or in any part of the world where we wish to seek regulatory approval for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, the value of the product candidates to produce revenue would diminish. Additionally, if our products, methods, processes, and other technologies or our commercial use of such products, processes, and other technologies, including but not limited to any trade name, trademark or commercial strategy infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs. The USPTO and the patent offices of other jurisdictions have issued to us a number of patents for our various inventions and we have in-licensed several patents from various institutions. We have filed additional patent applications and provisional patent applications with the USPTO. We have filed a number of corresponding foreign patent applications and intend to file additional foreign and U.S. patent applications, as appropriate. We have also filed certain trademark and trade name applications worldwide. We cannot assure you as to:\n\u25cf the degree and range of protection any patents will afford against competitors with similar products;\n\u25cf if and when patents will issue;\n\u25cf if patents do issue, we cannot be sure that we will be able to adequately defend such patents and whether or not we will be able to adequately enforce such patents; or\n\u25cf whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patent applications.\nIf the USPTO or other foreign patent office upholds patents issued to others or if the USPTO grants patent applications filed by others, we may have to:\n\u25cf\nobtain licenses or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf\nstop using the subject matter claimed in those patents; or\n\u25cf\npay damages.\nWe may initiate, or others may bring against us, litigation or administrative proceedings related to intellectual property rights, including proceedings before the USPTO or other foreign patent office. Any judgment adverse to us in any litigation or other proceeding arising in connection with a patent or patent application could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs of any such proceeding may be substantial whether or not we are successful.\nOur success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience, none of which is patentable, of our scientific and technical personnel. To help protect our rights, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information, and if any of our proprietary information is disclosed, our business will suffer because our revenues depend upon our ability to license or commercialize our product candidates and any such events would significantly impair the value of such product candidates.\nProduct Liability Risks\nWe face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our products or product candidates results in personal injury or death and our product liability insurance coverage may be insufficient.\nIf the use or misuse of any products we sell, or a partner sells, harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, third-party payors or others. The use of our product candidates in clinical trials, including post marketing clinical studies, could also expose us to product liability claims. We cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our products or the testing of product candidates, and therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently have may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or defense costs we might incur. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could give rise to a substantial liability that could exceed our resources. Even if claims are not successful, the costs of defending such claims and potential adverse publicity could be harmful to our business.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face even greater risks upon any commercialization by us of our product candidates. We have product liability insurance covering our clinical trials. Clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance or increase our existing coverage at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us if one of our products or product candidates causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:\n\u25cf\nliabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay from other sources, if available;\n\u25cf\nan increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers or patients;\n\u25cf\ndamage to our reputation and the reputation of our products, resulting in lower sales;\n\u25cf\nregulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications;\n\u25cf\nlitigation costs; and\n\u25cf\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from managing our business.\nRisks Relating to Contractual Arrangements\nWe face risks related to our government-funded programs; if BARDA/HHS or NIAID/HHS were to eliminate, reduce or delay funding from our contracts, this would have a significant negative impact on the programs associated with such funding and could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and cash flows.\nWe have completed work under a contract with BARDA/HHS for the development of RAPIVAB and have entered into contracts with BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS for the development of galidesivir as a treatment for diseases caused by RNA pathogens, including Marburg virus disease, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus disease. In contracting with these government agencies, we are subject to various U.S. Government contract requirements, including general clauses for a cost-reimbursement research and development contract, which may limit our reimbursement or, if we are found to be in violation, could result in contract termination. If the U.S. Government terminates any of its contracts with us for its convenience, or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms, significant negative impact on our cash flows and operations could result.\nU.S. Government contracts typically contain a number of extraordinary provisions that would not typically be found in commercial contracts and which may create a disadvantage and additional risks to us as compared to competitors that do not rely on U.S. Government contracts. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:\n\u25cf\nterminate or reduce the scope of our contract with or without cause;\n\u25cf\ninterpret relevant regulations (federal acquisition regulation clauses);\n\u25cf\nrequire performance under circumstances which may not be favorable to us;\n\u25cf\nrequire an in-process review where the U.S. Government will review the project and its options under the contract;\n\u25cf\ncontrol the timing and amount of funding, which impacts the development progress of our programs; and\n\u25cf\naudit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.\nThe U.S. Government may terminate its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms. Termination for convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed, and settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination does not permit these recoveries under default provisions. In the event of termination or upon expiration of a contract, the U.S. Government may dispute wind-down and termination costs and may question prior expenses under the contract and deny payment of those expenses. Should we choose to challenge the U.S. Government for denying certain payments under a contract, such a challenge could subject us to substantial additional expenses which we may or may not recover. Further, if the U.S. Government terminates its contracts with us for its convenience, or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms, significant negative impact on our cash flows and operations could result.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards relating to our accounting practices and are subject to periodic audits and reviews. As part of any such audit or review, the U.S. Government may review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Audits under the active BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS galidesivir contracts may occur at the election of the U.S. Government and have been concluded through fiscal 2015; all subsequent fiscal years are still open and auditable. Based on the results of its audits, the U.S. Government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. This adjustment could impact the amount of revenues reported on a historic basis and could impact our cash flows under the contracts prospectively. In addition, in the event BARDA/HHS or NIAID/HHS determines that certain costs and fees were unallowable or determines that the allocated indirect cost rate was higher than the actual indirect cost rate, BARDA/HHS or NIAID/HHS would be entitled to recoup any overpayment from us as a result. In addition, if an audit or review uncovers any improper or illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of our contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs may not be reimbursable or allowed under our contracts. Further, as a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities as compared to private sector commercial companies.\nThere are risks related to the potential government use or sale of our antivirals.\nGovernment use or sale, in emergency situations or otherwise, of our antivirals-including peramivir for the treatment of influenza-may result in risks to us or our collaborative partners. There can be no assurance that government use of our antivirals (whether as indicated or outside of their current indications) will prove to be generally safe, well-tolerated and effective. Any government sale or use (on an emergency basis or otherwise) of our antivirals in any country may create liabilities for us or our partners.\nIn September 2018, we entered into a contract with the U.S. Government for the procurement of up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) over a five-year period. In addition, we are working with NIAID/HHS to further develop galidesivir. There can be no assurance that we or our manufacturers will be able to fully meet the demand for such antivirals with respect to these or future arrangements. Further, we may not receive a favorable purchase price for future orders, if any, of our antivirals by governmental entities. Our competitors may develop products that could compete with or replace any antivirals selected for government sale or use. We may face competition in markets where we have no existing intellectual property protection or are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights.\nThere can be no assurance that the non-U.S. partnerships that we have entered into for peramivir will result in any order for peramivir in those countries or that peramivir will be approved for any use or will achieve market approval in additional countries. There can be no assurance that galidesivir will be approved for use in any countries. In the event that any emergency use or market approval is granted in any country, there can be no assurance that any government order or commercialization of the applicable product or product candidate in such countries will be substantial or will be profitable to us.\nIf we fail to reach milestones or to make annual minimum payments or otherwise breach our obligations under our license agreements, our licensors may terminate our agreements with them and seek additional remedies.\nIf we are unable or fail to meet payment obligations, performance milestones relating to the timing of regulatory filings, product supply obligations, post approval commitments, or development and commercial diligence obligations; are unable or fail to make milestone payments or material data use payments in accordance with applicable provisions; or fail to pay the minimum annual payments under any of our in-licenses relating to our products or product candidates, our licensors may terminate the applicable license or seek other available remedies. As a result, our development of the respective product candidate or commercialization of the product would cease.\nRoyalties and milestone payments from Shionogi under the Shionogi Agreement are required to be used by Royalty Sub to satisfy its obligations under its PhaRMA Notes, and generally will not be available to us for other purposes unless and until Royalty Sub has repaid in full its obligations under the PhaRMA Notes.\nIn March 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Royalty Sub, issued $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of PhaRMA Notes. The PhaRMA Notes are secured principally by (i) certain royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement, pursuant to which Shionogi licensed from us the rights to market peramivir in Japan and Taiwan and (ii) the pledge by us of our equity interest in Royalty Sub. Payments from Shionogi to us on non-governmental sales under the Shionogi Agreement will generally not be available to us for other purposes unless and until Royalty Sub has repaid in full its obligations under the PhaRMA Notes. Accordingly, these funds have been and will continue to be required to be dedicated to Royalty Sub\u2019s debt service and not available to us for product development or other purposes. Since September 1, 2014, payments from Shionogi have been insufficient for Royalty Sub to service its obligations under the PhaRMA Notes, resulting in a continuing event of default with respect to the PhaRMA Notes since that time. As a result of the continuing event of default, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may be able to foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interest in Royalty Sub and may exercise other remedies available to them under the indenture or other documents related to the PhaRMA Notes. In such event, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes, we may incur legal costs and we might otherwise be adversely affected.\nThe PhaRMA Notes had a final legal maturity date of December 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes of $30.0 million, together with accrued and unpaid interest of $20.6 million, was due in full. The failure by Royalty Sub to repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, at the December 1, 2020 final maturity date constituted an additional event of default under the PhaRMA Notes. We cannot predict whether holders of PhaRMA Notes will seek to pursue any remedies as a result of the continuing events of default with respect to the PhaRMA Notes. The PhaRMA Notes are the obligation of Royalty Sub. As a result, we do not currently expect the continuing events of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. However, we cannot assure you that this will be the case or that we will not otherwise be adversely affected as a result the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes or the failure by Royalty Sub to repay the PhaRMA Notes at maturity.\nBecause continuing events of default exist under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may be able to pursue acceleration of the PhaRMA Notes and foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interest in Royalty Sub. As a result, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and we could otherwise be adversely affected.\nAs Royalty Sub has been unable to service its obligations under the PhaRMA Notes and continuing events of default exist under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may be able to foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interest in Royalty Sub and may exercise other remedies available to them under the indenture or other documents related to the PhaRMA Notes. In such event, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes, we may incur legal costs and we might otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, the PhaRMA Notes have a final legal maturity date of December 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, was due in full. The failure by Royalty Sub to repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, at the December 1, 2020 final maturity date constituted an additional event of default under the PhaRMA Notes. We cannot predict whether holders of PhaRMA Notes will seek to pursue any remedies as a result of the continuing events of default with respect to the PhaRMA Notes. The PhaRMA Notes are the obligation of Royalty Sub. As a result, we do not currently expect the continuing events of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. However, we cannot assure you that this will be the case or that we will not otherwise be adversely affected as a result the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes or the failure by Royalty Sub to repay the PhaRMA Notes at maturity.\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, our Credit Agreement contains conditions and restrictions that limit our flexibility in drawing on the additional funds thereunder and in operating our business. We may be required to make a prepayment or repay our outstanding indebtedness earlier than we expect if a prepayment event or an event of default occurs, including a material adverse change with respect to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an outstanding principal balance under our Credit Agreement of $125.0 million. We may also draw up to another $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount under the Term B Loan and the Term C Loan (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Credit Agreement if, among other conditions, the Company reaches defined revenue milestones and, with respect to a draw on the Term C Loan, the Term B Loan has been funded prior to or contemporaneously with the Term C Loan. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it:\n\u25cf increases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u25cf limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates;\n\u25cf requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes;\n\u25cf limits our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and\n\u25cf places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nFurthermore, our Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, these covenants limit our ability to, among other things, grant certain types of liens on our assets; make certain investments; incur or assume certain debt, including accessing additional tranches of debt under the Credit Agreement; engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, and similar transactions; dispose of assets; license certain property; distribute dividends; make certain restricted payments; change the nature of our business; engage in transactions with affiliates and insiders; prepay other indebtedness; or engage in sale and leaseback transactions.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain at all times, as applicable, at least $15.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents if only the Term A Loan (as defined in the Credit Agreement) has been drawn; at least $20.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents if the Term B Loan has been drawn but the Term C Loan has not been drawn; and at least $15.0 million (or, in certain circumstances, $20.0 million) of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents if the Term C Loan has been drawn, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, if we draw upon the Term C Loan, we will be required to achieve certain minimum targets for consolidated net revenues from ORLADEYO sales in the U.S.\nThe covenants contained in the Credit Agreement could cause us to be unable to pursue business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial without the lenders\u2019 permission or without repaying all outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. An event of default will also occur if, among other things, we fail to pay amounts due under the Credit Agreement, we fail to repay certain other indebtedness having an aggregate principal amount in excess of one percent of our borrowings under the Credit Agreement, a material adverse change in our business, assets, properties, liabilities, or condition occurs, or a material impairment of our ability to perform our obligations under the Credit Agreement occurs, we experience a change of control, certain negative regulatory events occur, including without limitation the loss of a required permit or a recall of a product, or we fail to make required payments under our Royalty Purchase Agreement with RPI. In the case of a continuing event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Credit Agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, proceed against the collateral in which we granted to the lenders a security interest, or otherwise exercise the rights of a secured creditor. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in, subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of our assets. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure the Credit Agreement obligations, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.\nRisks Relating to International Operations\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks.\nOur business strategy includes international expansion, including the commercialization of products outside of the United States. We currently conduct clinical studies and regulatory activities and have hired, and expect to continue hiring, employees outside of the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nmultiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as privacy and data regulations, transparency regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\u25cf\nintroduction of new health authority requirements and/or changes in health authority expectations;\n\u25cf\nfailure by us or our partners to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries;\n\u25cf\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection for, and enforcing, our intellectual property;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay systems;\n\u25cf\nlimits on our ability to penetrate international markets;\n\u25cf\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters and political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, results of certain elections and votes, actual or threatened public health emergencies and outbreak of disease (including for example, the recent coronavirus outbreak), boycotts, adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions, and other business restrictions;\n\u25cf\ncertain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation, and insurance;\n\u25cf\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over commercial operations and activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, including its books and records provisions or anti-bribery provisions, or the U.K. Bribery Act and similar foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf\nregulatory and compliance risks relating to doing business with any entity that is subject to sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion of operations and, consequently, our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in some countries, such as Japan and the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with European governmental regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could harm our business.\nEU member states, Switzerland and other countries have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for \u201cspecial category data,\u201d which includes health, biometric and genetic information of data subjects located in the EU. Further, GDPR provides a broad right for EU member states to create supplemental national laws, for example relating to the processing of health, genetic and biometric data, which could further limit our ability to use and share such data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer \u201cadequate\u201d privacy protections.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU member states, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in significant fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or \u20ac20.0 million, whichever is greater, and in addition to such fines, our failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR may subject us to litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could have material adverse effects on our reputation and business. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we are required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, makes it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, will require the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (i.e., health data) is processed on a large scale, introduces mandatory data breach notification throughout the EU, imposes additional obligations on us when we are contracting with service providers and requires us to adopt appropriate privacy governance including policies, procedures, training and data audit.\nWe are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we undertake clinical trials. We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the provision of our services, a number of which process personal data of EU individuals on our behalf. With each such provider we are required to enter into contractual arrangements under which they are contractually obligated to only process personal data according to our instructions, and conduct diligence to ensure that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place.\nWe are also subject to evolving European privacy laws on electronic marketing and cookies. The EU is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation that will be directly implemented in the laws of each European member state. While this e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018, it is still going through the European legislative process and the timing of its adoption remains unclear.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s decision to withdraw from the EU could result in increased regulatory and legal complexity, which may make it more difficult for us to do business in Europe and impose additional challenges in securing regulatory approval of our product candidates in Europe.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, or Brexit, has caused political and economic uncertainty, including in the regulatory framework applicable to our operations and product candidates, and this uncertainty may persist for years. Brexit could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the EU, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend in part on how the current and future trade agreements between the United Kingdom and the EU take effect in practice. Changes in United Kingdom or EU regulations may cause disruption or delays in granting clinical trial authorization or opinions for marketing authorization, disruption of importation and export of active substance and other components of new drug formulations, and disruption of the supply chain for clinical trial product and final authorized formulations.\nThe cumulative effects of the disruption to the regulatory framework may add considerably to the development lead time to marketing authorization and commercialization of products in the EU and/or the United Kingdom. It is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, which can disrupt the timing of our clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, changes in, and legal uncertainty with regard to, national and international laws and regulations may present difficulties for our clinical and regulatory strategy. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenues and achieve and sustain profitability.\nIn addition, as a result of Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the EU. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the absence of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will have and how such withdrawal will affect us, and the full extent to which our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Technology\nIf our facilities, or the facilities of our third-party vendors, incur damage or power is lost for a significant length of time, our business will suffer.\nWe and our third-party vendors store commercial product, clinical and stability samples at our facilities that could be damaged if the facilities incur physical damage or in the event of an extended power failure. We have backup power systems in addition to backup generators to maintain power to all critical functions, but any loss of these samples could result in significant delays in our drug development process.\nIn addition, we store most of our preclinical and clinical data at our facilities. Duplicate copies of most critical data are secured off-site. Any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems could cause us to inaccurately calculate or lose our data. Loss of data could result in significant delays in our drug development process and any system failure could harm our business and operations.\nA significant disruption in our information technology systems or a cybersecurity breach could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business. In addition, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities regulate, among other things, the record keeping and storage of data pertaining to potential pharmaceutical products. We currently store most of our preclinical research data, our clinical data and our manufacturing data at our facility. While we do store duplicate copies of most of our clinical data offsite and a significant portion of our data is included in regular backups of our systems, we could lose important data if our facility incurs damage, or if our vendor data systems fail, suffer damage or are destroyed.\nLike other companies in our industry, our networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, foreign companies, or competitors, or may be breached by employee error, malfeasance or other disruption. A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction, or interruption of critical information technology systems could negatively impact operations. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any compromise of our data security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our data security measures, which could harm our business. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or those of third parties with which we do business, and any such events could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Investing in Our Common Stock\nOur existing principal stockholders hold a substantial amount of our common stock and may be able to influence significant corporate decisions, which may conflict with the interest of other stockholders.\nSeveral of our stockholders own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Our top ten stockholders own close to 50% of BioCryst and can individually, and as a group, influence our operations based upon their concentrated ownership and may also be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring approval of the stockholders, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions.\nOur stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline significantly.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. Moreover, our stock price has fluctuated frequently, and these fluctuations are often not related to our financial results. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the 52-week range of the market price of our stock was from $1.58 to $8.99 per share. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nadditional dilution through sales of our common stock or other derivative securities;\n\u25cf\nstatus of new or existing licensing or collaborative agreements and government contracts;\n\u25cf\nannouncements relating to the status of our programs;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments and announcements regarding new and virulent strains of influenza;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners achieving or failing to achieve development milestones;\n\u25cf\npublicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\npublicity regarding certain public health concerns for which we are or may be developing treatments;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf\npublic concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical products;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems, including developments in price control legislation;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel or members of our board of directors;\n\u25cf\npurchases or sales of substantial amounts of our stock by existing stockholders, including officers or directors;\n\u25cf\neconomic and other external factors or other disasters or crises; and\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nFuture sales and issuances of securities may dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders and cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock by us or our current stockholders into the public market could cause the market price of our stock to fall. As of January 31, 2021, there were 177,182,751 shares of our common stock outstanding. We may from time to time issue securities in relation to a license arrangement, collaboration, merger or acquisition. We may also sell, for our own account, shares of common stock or other equity securities, from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale.\nAs of January 31, 2021, there were 24,780,638 stock options outstanding and 4,587,872 shares available for issuance under our Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan, 4,307,668 stock options outstanding and 92,332 shares available for issuance under our Amended and Restated Inducement Equity Incentive Plan and 2,679,554 shares available for issuance under our Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In addition, we could also make equity grants outside of our Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan or Amended and Restated Inducement Equity Incentive Plan. The shares underlying existing stock options, restricted stock units and possible future stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards have been registered pursuant to registration statements on Form S-8.\nIf some or all of such shares are sold or otherwise issued into the public market over a short period of time, our current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests may be diluted and the value of all publicly traded shares is likely to decline, as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at then-current market prices. Additionally, such sales and issuances may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable, or at all.\nIn March 2017, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with entities affiliated with Baker Bros. Advisors LP (the \u201cBaker Entities\u201d) to provide that, if requested, we will register the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the Baker Entities for resale under the Securities Act. Our registration obligations pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement cover all shares then held or thereafter acquired by the Baker Entities, for up to ten years, and include our obligation to facilitate certain underwritten public offerings of our common stock by the Baker Entities in the future. On May 10, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to 11,710,951 shares of common stock held by the Baker Entities. Subsequently, on November 21, 2019, certain of the Baker Entities acquired pre-funded warrants to purchase 11,764,706 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.69 per warrant. In addition, on June 1, 2020, we issued pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,511,111 shares of our common stock at a price of $4.49 per warrant, including pre-funded warrants acquired by certain of the Baker Entities to purchase 3,252,375 shares of our common stock. Each warrant has an exercise price of $0.01 per share. If the Baker Entities, by exercising their underwriting rights or otherwise, sell a large number of our shares, or the market perceives that the Baker Entities intend to sell a large number of our shares, this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have anti-takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents that may result in outcomes with which you do not agree.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of those shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nIn addition, our Certificate of Incorporation provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors and supermajority approval of the removal of any member of the board of directors and prevents our stockholders from acting by written consent. Our Certificate of Incorporation also requires supermajority approval of any amendment of these provisions. These provisions and other provisions of our bylaws and of Delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for such disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents arising out of or relating to any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or our Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws or (iv) any action against us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to establish the Delaware Court of Chancery as the forum for actions or proceedings brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to choose its preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits with respect to such claims. If a court were to find this exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in another jurisdiction, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nNatural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks, trade wars, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our development partners, manufacturers, regulators or other third parties with whom we conduct business now or in the future.\nA wide variety of events beyond our control, including natural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), trade wars, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our development partners (such as Torii), manufacturers, regulatory authorities, or other third parties with whom we conduct business. These events may cause businesses and government agencies to be shut down, supply chains to be interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and individuals to become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. If our operations or those of third parties with whom we have business are impaired or curtailed as a result of these events, the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be impaired or halted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. See \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Risks Relating to COVID-19-Our business, operations, clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, and access to capital could be adversely affected by the effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic on us or on third parties with whom we conduct business, including without limitation our development partners, manufacturers, CROs, and others, as well as on the regulatory and government agencies with whom we work.\u201d\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, which could result in losses or unexpected expenditure of time and resources.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in disputes, called upon to initiate legal proceedings or to defend ourselves in such legal proceedings relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties in legal proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in securities class action lawsuits in the future. Any current or future dispute resolution or legal proceeding, regardless of the merits of any such proceeding, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nInsurance coverage is increasingly more costly and difficult to obtain or maintain.\nWhile we currently have insurance for our business, property, directors and officers, and our products, insurance is increasingly more costly and narrower in scope, and we may be required to assume more risk in the future. If we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage in excess of our insurance coverage, we will be required to bear any loss in excess of our insurance limits. If we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage that is outside of our insurance coverage, we may incur significant uninsured costs associated with loss or damage that could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Furthermore, any claims made on our insurance policies may impact our ability to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at reasonable costs or at all.\nIf we fail to retain our existing key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional key personnel, the development of our product candidates and commercialization of our products and the related expansion of our business will be delayed or stopped.\nWe are highly dependent upon our senior management and scientific team, the unexpected loss of whose services might impede the achievement of our development and commercial objectives. This risk has been heightened in the current environment as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Competition for key personnel with the experience that we require is intense and is expected to continue to increase. Our inability to attract and retain the required number of skilled and experienced management, commercial, operational and scientific personnel will harm our business because we rely upon these personnel for many critical functions of our business.", "PERMNO": 80306, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "BCRX"}
