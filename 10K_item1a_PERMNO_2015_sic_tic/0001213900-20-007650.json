{"cik": "811641", "company": "IMMUCELL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nProduction capacity constraints: The inability to meet market demand for our products, discussed elsewhere in this report in more detail, is a risk to our business. Our plan to continue to expand the First Defense\u00ae product line requires ongoing review of equipment capacity and utilization across the manufacturing value stream at the 56 Evergreen Drive facility and our leased facility at 175 Industrial Way, as well as assessment of functional obsolescence and reliability of equipment. With the additional capital we raised at the end of the first quarter of 2019, we are investing approximately $3.5 million to increase our liquid processing capacity by 100% and our freeze drying capacity by 50% for the First Defense\u00ae product line. There is a risk that we will not be able to achieve our production capacity growth objectives on a timely basis and that we could experience an interruption to product supply during the expansion process.\nRisk of experiencing higher than anticipated costs, or delays in expanding our manufacturing facilities and risk of failing to access adequate funding to complete the expansion projects: As discussed above and elsewhere in this report in more detail, we presently intend to invest the aggregate of approximately $7.5 million to: i) expand our existing production facilities for our First Defense\u00ae product line (approximately $3.5 million) and ii) construct and equip our own Drug Product formulation and aseptic filling capability for Re-Tain\u2122 inside our existing Drug Substance facility (approximately $4 million). Actual project costs could exceed our current estimates. Also, our ability to fund the completion of these projects may depend on cash flows from future operations, which may not materialize or be available at the needed levels. In addition, completion of either project could be delayed due to factors outside our control, including equipment delivery delays or delays in obtaining FDA approvals for Re-Tain\u2122.\nProjection of net income (loss): Generally speaking, our financial performance can differ significantly from management projections, due to numerous factors that are difficult to predict or that are beyond our control. Weaker than expected sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line could lead to less profits or an operating loss.\nNet deferred tax assets: The realizability of our net deferred tax assets is a subjective estimate that is contingent upon many variables. During the second quarter of 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets that significantly increased our net loss in comparison to other periods. This non-cash expense could be reversed, and this valuation allowance could be reduced or eliminated, if warranted by our profitability and projected profitability in the future. We will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each quarter.\nReliance on sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line: We are heavily reliant on the market acceptance of the First Defense\u00ae product line to generate product sales and fund our operations. Our business would not have been profitable during the nine consecutive years in the period ended December 31, 2007, during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 or during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, without the gross margin that we earned on sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line.\nConcentration of sales: Sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line aggregated 97% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our primary customers for the majority of our product sales (89% and 87% during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) are in the U.S. dairy and beef industries. Product sales to international customers, who are also in the dairy and beef industries, aggregated 10% and 13% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The concentration of our sales from one product into one market is a risk to our business. The animal health distribution segment has been aggressively consolidating over the last few years with larger distributors acquiring smaller distributors. A large portion of our product sales (69% and 66% during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) was made to two large distributors. A large portion of our trade accounts receivable (76% and 72% as of December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively) was due from these two distributors. We have a good history with these distributors, but the concentration of sales and accounts receivable with a small number of customers does present a risk to us, including risks related to such customers experiencing financial difficulties or altering the basis on which they do business with us in a manner unfavorable to us.\nGross margin on product sales: It is one of our goals to again achieve a gross margin (before related depreciation expenses) as a percentage of total sales close to 50% after the initial launch of new products. Depreciation expense will be a larger component of costs of goods sold for Re-Tain\u2122 than it is for the First Defense\u00ae product line. Gross margins generally improve over time, but this anticipated improvement may not be realized. Many factors discussed in this report impact our costs of goods sold. There is a risk that we are not able to achieve our gross margin goals, which would adversely affect our operating results and could impact our future operating plans.\nImmuCell Corporation\nProduct risks: The sale of our products is subject to production, financial, efficacy, regulatory, competitive and other market risks. Elevated standards to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance required to sell our products continue to evolve. Failure to achieve acceptable biological yields from our production processes can materially increase our costs of goods sold and reduce our production output, leading to an order backlog that could adversely affect our customer relationships and operating results. There is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market acceptance at a profitable price level or that we can continue to manufacture our products at a low enough cost to result in a sufficient gross margin to justify their continued manufacture and sale.\nIncreasing dependence on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems: We rely on information systems throughout our company. Any disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business. Although we maintain information security policies and employ system backup measures and engage in information system redundancy planning and processes, such policies, measures, planning and processes, as well as our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities. As information systems and the use of software and related applications by us, our business partners, suppliers, and customers become more cloud-based, we become inherently more susceptible to cyberattacks. There has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, including more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information. Any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. While we have invested in our data and information technology infrastructure (including working with an information security technology consultant to assess and enhance our security systems and procedures, and periodically training our employees in such systems and procedures), there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption, attack, or security breach and, as such, the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains. We have not experienced any material adverse effect on our business or operations as a consequence of any such attack or breach, but may incur increasing costs in performing the tasks described above. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions and the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, which vary in technique and sources, if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions, or our customers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations. Furthermore, any access to, public disclosure of, or other loss of data or information (including any of our - or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 - confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information) as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings, which could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, damage or ability to develop (and protect our rights to) our proprietary technologies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nProduct liability: The manufacture and sale of our products entails a risk of product liability. Our exposure to product liability is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our products are directed towards the animal health market. We have maintained product liability insurance in an amount which we believe is reasonable in relation to our potential exposure in this area. We have no history of claims of this nature being made.\nRegulatory requirements for the First Defense\u00ae product line: First Defense\u00ae is sold in the United States subject to a product license from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, which was first obtained in 1991 with subsequent approvals of line extensions in 2017 and 2018. As such, our operations are subject to periodic inspection by the USDA. The potency of serial lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims (the Reference Standard). Due to the unique nature of the label claims, host animal re-testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability of stored Reference Standard. To date, these analyses have demonstrated strong stability. However, if the USDA were not to approve requalification of the Reference Standard, additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product, which could interrupt sales and adversely affect our operating results. We expect to be subject to similar regulatory oversight risks in territories outside of the United States where we sell our products.\nImmuCell Corporation\nRegulatory requirements for Re-Tain\u2122: The commercial introduction of this product in the United States requires us to obtain FDA approval. Completing the development through to approval of the NADA by the FDA involves risk. While four of the five required Technical Sections have been approved, the development process timeline has been extensive (approximately 20 years) and has involved multiple commercial production strategies. The first phased Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Technical Section was submitted for the Nisin Drug Substance during the first quarter of 2019, and the FDA response was received during the third quarter of 2019. We expect to make the second phased Drug Substance and Drug Product submission before the end of 2020. Completion of the Drug Product development and scale-up work and subsequent product stability testing defines the remaining timeline to product approval. To reduce the risk associated with this process, we have engaged Norbrook for the Drug Product work and continue to meet with the FDA to align on filing strategy and requirements. We have disclosed a timeline of events that could lead to potential approval during 2021. However, there remains a risk that approval could be delayed or not obtained. We are exposed to additional regulatory compliance risks through the subcontractors that we choose to work with to produce Re-Tain\u2122, who also need to satisfy certain regulatory requirements in order to provide us with the products and services we need. International regulatory approvals would be required for sales outside of the United States. European regulatory authorities are expected to require a milk discard period when using such a product, which would remove a significant competitive advantage in that territory. However, the assigned milk discard period may be shorter for our product than it is for other mastitis products on the market in Europe.\nEconomics of the dairy and beef industries:\n\u00b7 The January count of all cattle and calves in the United States had steadily declined from 97,000,000 as of January 1, 2007 to 88,500,000 as of January 1, 2014. Then this figure increased each year to reach 94,800,000 as of January 1, 2019 before declining slightly to 94,400,000 as of January 1, 2020.\n\u00b7 From 1998 through 2019, the size (annual average) of the U.S. dairy herd ranged from approximately the low of 9,011,000 (2004) to the high of 9,399,000 (2018). This annual average dropped slightly to 9,336,000 during 2019.\n\u00b7 The Class III milk price (an industry benchmark that reflects the value of product used to make cheese) is an important indicator because it defines our customers\u2019 revenue level. This annual average milk price level (measured in dollars per hundred pounds of milk) reached its highest point (since these prices were first reported in 1980) during 2014 at $22.34 (peaking at $24.60 in September 2014). This strong milk price level during 2014 declined to the average of $15.80 during 2015 and further declined to $14.87 during 2016, but increased by 9% to $16.17 during 2017 and then declined by 10% to $14.61 during 2018. During 2019, this milk price average increased by 16% to $16.96. The low price level during 2018 and into the beginning of 2019 was very challenging to the profitability of our customers. The November 2019 price of $20.45 was the first time the price was above $20.00 since November 2014. The average price of $18.67 for the second half of 2019 and of $19.51 for the fourth quarter of 2019 are positive trends that could benefit our customers if maintained. The recent annual fluctuations in this milk price level are demonstrated in the following table:\nImmuCell Corporation\n\u00b7 The actual level of milk prices may be less important than its level relative to feed costs. One measure of this relationship is known as the milk-to-feed price ratio, which represents the amount of feed that one pound of milk can buy. This ratio varies farm-to-farm based on individual operating parameters. The highest annual average this ratio has reached since this ratio was first reported in 1985 was 3.64 in 1987. The annual average for this ratio of 1.52 in 2012 was the lowest recorded since it was first reported in 1985. Since this ratio reached 3.24 in 2005, it has not exceeded 3.0. The annual average of 2.54 for 2014 was the highest this ratio has been since it was 2.81 in 2007. This ratio averaged 2.05 during 2018 and increased to 2.24 during 2019. An increase in feed costs also has a negative impact on the beef industry. The following table demonstrates the annual volatility and the low values of this ratio recently:\n\u00b7 While the number of cows in the U.S. herd and the production of milk per cow directly influence the supply of milk, the price for milk is also influenced by very volatile international demand for milk products.\n\u00b7 The all-time high value (annual average) for a milk cow was $1,993 during 2015. Since then, this annual average value steadily declined to $1,208 during 2019.\n\u00b7 The industry data referred to above is compiled from USDA databases. Additionally, the value of newborn bull calves had risen to the unusually high level of approximately $300 to $400 during 2015 but has declined to very little presently, depending on region.\nGiven our focus on the dairy and beef industries, the volatile market conditions and the resulting financial insecurities of our primary end users are risks to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level. These factors also heighten the challenge of selling premium-priced animal health products (such as Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae and Re-Tain\u2122) into the dairy market.\nProduct development risks: The development of new products is subject to financial, scientific, regulatory and market risks. Our current business growth strategy relies heavily on the development of Re-Tain\u2122, our new product to treat subclinical mastitis, which has required (and will continue to require) a substantial investment of capital resources and personnel. Our efforts are subject to inspection and approval by the FDA. There is no assurance whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval for this product.\nRisks associated with our funding strategy for Re-Tain\u2122: Achieving FDA approval of our pharmaceutical-grade Nisin produced at commercial-scale is the most critical action in front of us on our path to U.S. regulatory approval of Re-Tain\u2122. Having completed construction of the production facility described elsewhere in this report at a cost of approximately $20.8 million, we will continue to incur product development expenses to operate and maintain this facility. The additional debt we incurred to fund this project has significantly increased our debt service costs going forward. These loans are subject to certain financial covenants. Absent sufficient sales of Re-Tain\u2122 at a profitable gross margin, we would be required to fund all debt service costs from sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line, which would reduce, and could eliminate, our expected profitability going forward and significantly reduce our cash flows.\nUncertainty of market size and product sales estimates: Estimating the size of the total addressable market and future sales growth potential for our First Defense\u00ae product line is difficult and subjective. Estimating the size of the market for any new product, such as Re-Tain\u2122, is subject to numerous uncertainties. We do not know whether, or to what extent, our products will achieve or increase market acceptance and profitability. Some of the uncertainties surrounding Re-Tain\u2122 include market acceptance, the development of the subclinical mastitis treatment market, the effect of a premium selling price on market penetration, competition from existing products sold by substantially larger competitors, the risk of competition from other new products, cost of manufacture and integration of milk from treated cows with susceptible cheese starter cultures.\nImmuCell Corporation\nExposure to debt service obligations and debt covenants: Rising interest rates could negatively affect the operating costs of dairy and beef producers and thus put further financial pressure on an already stressed business sector. We removed this exposure to our business by refinancing our bank debt to fixed rate notes during the first quarter of 2020. Under our refinanced bank debt agreements, we are required by bank debt covenant to maintain at least $1.4 million in cash escrow in favor of the bank until we achieve certain debt service coverage and collateral value metrics. This requirement effectively reduces the availability of our liquid assets for operational needs. We are obligated to make principal and interest payment aggregating approximately $871,000 over the first twelve-month period of our new debt obligations.\nCompetition from others: Many of our competitors are significantly larger and more diversified in the relevant markets than we are and have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development and sales/distribution capabilities than we do, including greater ability to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and declining revenues and/or profitability. Merck and Zoetis, among other companies, sell products that compete directly with the First Defense\u00ae product line in preventing scours in newborn calves. The scours product sold by Zoetis sells for approximately half the price of our product, although it does not have an E. coli claim (which ours does). With Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae, we can now compete more effectively against vaccines that are given to the mother cow (dam) to improve the quality of the colostrum that she produces for the newborn calf. Merck and Zoetis dominate the market for these dam vaccine products. The market for the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows is highly competitive and presently is dominated by large companies such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck and Zoetis. The mastitis products sold by these large companies are well established in the market and are priced lower than what we expect for our product, but all of them involve traditional antibiotics and are sold subject to a requirement to discard milk during and for a period of time after treatment. There is no assurance that our products will compete successfully in these markets. We may not be aware of other companies that compete with us or intend to compete with us in the future.\nAccess to raw materials and contract manufacturing services: Our objective is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used to manufacture and test our products that we obtain from third parties. However, there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies. We have significantly increased the number of farms from which we purchase colostrum for the First Defense\u00ae product line. The loss of farms from which we buy raw material could make it difficult for us to produce enough inventory to meet customer demand. The specific antibodies that we purify from colostrum for the First Defense\u00ae product line are not readily available from other sources. We are and will be dependent on our manufacturing facilities and operations in Portland for the production of the First Defense\u00ae product line and Re-Tain\u2122. We are and will be dependent on one manufacturer for the supply of the syringes used for our gel tube formats of Dual-Force First Defense\u00ae and Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae and one other manufacturer for the supply of syringes for Re-Tain\u2122. We expect to be dependent on a contract with Norbrook for the Drug Product formulation and aseptic filling of our Nisin Drug Substance for orders placed through December 31, 2021 with deliveries extending into the beginning of 2022. We expect to complete the investment to perform these services in-house during 2022. The facility we intend to construct to perform these services in-house will be subject to FDA inspection and approval. The potential alternative options for these services are narrowed considerably because our product cannot be formulated or filled in a facility that also processes traditional antibiotics (i.e. beta lactams). Any significant damage to or other disruption in the services at any of these third-party facilities or our own facilities (including due to regulatory non-compliance) could adversely affect the production of inventory and result in significant added expenses and potential loss of future sales.\nSmall size; dependence on key personnel: We are a small company with 54 employees (including 3 part-time employees). As such, we rely on certain key employees to support multiple operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained. This challenge is heightened by the tight labor market conditions now prevailing. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, manufacturing, managerial and sales and marketing personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA or FDA approval for new products, to maintain regulatory compliance with current products and to continue to profitably sell our current products.\nImmuCell Corporation\nFailure to protect intellectual property: In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through operational safeguards and contractual agreements. Reliance upon trade secret, rather than patent, protection may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our manufacturing techniques and processes. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or technology or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Other companies may have filed patent applications and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize our products or achieve our business goals. If that were to be the case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to such patents on terms that are acceptable. There is also a risk that competitors could challenge the claims in patents that have been issued to us.\nCost burdens of our reporting obligations as a public company: Operating a public company involves substantial costs and administrative burdens to comply with reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nExposure to risks associated with the financial downturn and economic instability: The positive indications about the health of the U.S. economy since 2008 and prior to the coronavirus outbreak could prove temporary, and a downturn could occur. Some observers believe that the housing market remains problematic for the overall U.S. economy, the United States has taken on too much national debt and the equity markets are overvalued. The ultimate magnitude and duration of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak from China on the economy are unknown. Higher interest rates could adversely affect us and the general economy and our customers. The dairy market is presently under extreme economic pressure, causing many of our customers to lose money or only earn minimal profits. A small percentage reduction in the export of dairy products results in a significant drop in the domestic price of milk. Trade wars and related tariffs or embargos with China and other countries, or travel and other restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak and concerns arising from it, could have a negative impact on our industry and result in a reduction in our product sales. A combination of the conditions, trends and concerns summarized above could have a corresponding negative effect on our business and operations, including the demand for our products in the U.S. market and our ability to penetrate or maintain a profitable presence in international markets.\nGlobal coronavirus pandemic (novel coronavirus or COVID-19, technically known as SARS-CoV-2): The global coronavirus outbreak that began in China and has spread to the United States, Italy, South Korea, Iran, and other territories has become a pandemic affecting international trade and creating a worldwide economic crisis. Stock market valuations have declined significantly and the full impact of this viral outbreak on the global economy is very uncertain at this time. We could experience product shortages, backlogs and production slowdowns due to difficulties accessing needed supplies and labor and other restrictions affecting our ability to consistently deliver our products to market. Our exposure to this risk is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our supply chain is not heavily dependent on manufacturers in as yet heavily affected countries, on-going cross-training of our employees and early compliance with recommended hygiene and social distancing practices.\nBovine diseases: The potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Bovine Tuberculosis, Brucellosis and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) presents a risk to us and our customers. Documented cases of BSE in the United States have led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal origin, especially bovine. The First Defense\u00ae product line is manufactured from bovine milk (colostrum), which is not considered a BSE risk material. Future regulatory action to increase protection of the human food supply could affect the First Defense\u00ae product line, although presently we do not anticipate that this will be the case.\nBiological terrorism: The threat of biological terrorism is a risk to both the economic health of our customers and our ability to economically acquire and collect good quality raw material from our contract farms. Any act of widespread bioterrorism against the dairy industry could adversely affect our operations\nImmuCell Corporation\nCertain provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management: Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our Common Stock Rights Plan or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u00b7 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board of Directors to alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board of Directors to refuse to redeem rights issued under our Common Stock Rights Plan or otherwise to limit or suspend its operation that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u00b7 Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could depress the trading price of our common stock or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood of obtaining a premium for our common stock in an acquisition.\nStock market valuation and liquidity: Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq: ICCC). Our average daily trading volume is lower than the volume for most other companies and the bid/ask stock price spread can be larger and prices can be volatile, which could result in investors facing difficulty selling their stock for proceeds that they may expect or desire. Most companies in the animal health sector have market capitalization values that greatly exceed our current market capitalization of approximately $33 million as of March 19, 2020. Our product sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 were $13.7 million. This means that our market valuation as of March 19, 2020 was equal to approximately 2.4 times our sales during the year ended December 31, 2019. Before gross margin from the sale of new products is achieved, our market capitalization may be heavily dependent on the perceived potential for growth from our products under development and may therefore be negatively affected by the related uncertainties and risks.\nNo expectation to pay any dividends or repurchase stock for the foreseeable future: We do not anticipate paying any dividends to, or repurchasing stock from, our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to use cash to fund product development costs and investments in our facilities and production equipment, and to increase our working capital and to reduce debt. Stockholders must be prepared to rely on market sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, current and anticipated needs for liquidity and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nPossible dilution: We may need again to access the capital markets and issue additional common stock in order to fund our growth objectives, as described elsewhere in this report. Such issuances could have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 11292, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ICCC"}
