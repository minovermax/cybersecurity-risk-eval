{"cik": "726514", "company": "ELECTRO SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including without limitation statements containing the words \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \"anticipates\" and similar words, constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we may make other forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may differ materially. The following information highlights some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors. Factors that may result in such variances include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Competition and Customers\nVolatility of Our Customers\u2019 Industries\nOur business is dependent upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of microelectronics, PCB's, semiconductors, computers, wireless communications and other electronic products. The capital equipment market for microelectronics, semiconductor, and consumer electronics manufacturers has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand due to a number of factors including capacity utilization, timing of customers\u2019 new product introductions and demand for their products, inventory levels relative to demand and access to affordable capital. The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult or impossible to predict. As a result, business levels can vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year. Significant volatility in investment cycles in the market for microelectronics, PCB's and semiconductors used in electronic devices or in the market for consumer electronics reduce demand for our products and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The degree of the impact of any downturn on our business depends on a number of factors, including: the strength of the global economies, particularly those of Asia and the United States; the overall level of demand for consumer electronics products; the stability of global financial systems; and the overall health of the microelectronics, semiconductor, and consumer electronics industries.\nExpansion into New Markets\nOur future success depends in large part on our successful penetration of new markets adjacent to our existing markets and of the Chinese market for lower cost systems. These markets are new to us and our success is dependent on our displacing entrenched competitors who are familiar with these markets and are known to customers. In many cases we are attempting to penetrate these new markets with newly introduced products which are not yet proven in the industry. In addition, in some cases we will need to develop or expand our sales channels and customer relationships in order to execute on this strategy. There is no assurance that we will be successful in penetrating these new markets significantly or at all. If we fail to successfully penetrate these markets our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nHighly Competitive Markets\nWe face substantial competition from established competitors throughout the world, some of which have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Those competitors with greater resources may, in addition to other things, be able to better withstand periodic downturns, compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology, or more quickly develop enhancements to, and new generations of, products that compete with the products we manufacture and market. New companies may enter the markets in which we compete, or industry consolidation may occur, further increasing competition in those markets. We have also experienced new entrants to our markets offering aggressive price and payment terms in an attempt to gain market share. Some competitors, particularly in China, also develop low-cost products employing processes or technology developed by us. In addition, because we price our products in U.S. dollars, a strong U.S. dollar can make our products less price competitive outside of the United States to products priced in other currencies. We believe that to be competitive we must continue to expend significant financial resources in order to, among other things, invest in new product development and enhancements. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share.\nRevenues are Largely Dependent on Few Customers\nWe depend on a few significant customers for a large portion of our revenues. In 2016, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 51% of total net sales. We anticipate that sales of our products to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. Consolidation between customers, changes in technologies or solutions used by customers, changes in products manufactured by customers or in end-user demand for those products, selection of suppliers other than us, customer bankruptcies or customer departures from their respective industries all may result in even fewer customers accounting for a high percentage of our revenue and reduced demand from any single major customer. Also, business levels with several of our top customers are dependent on the Company winning new designs and features each product cycle, and there is no guarantee of future business based on past design wins. Furthermore, none of our customers have any long-term obligation to continue to buy our products or services and may therefore delay, reduce or cease ordering our products or services at any time. The cancellation, reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by even a single customer could significantly reduce our revenues in any particular quarter. If we were to lose any of our significant customers or suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders, revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreased Price Pressure\nWe have experienced and continue to experience pricing pressure in the sale of our products, from both competitors and customers. Pricing pressures typically have become more intense during cyclical downturns when competitors seek to maintain or increase market share, reduce inventory or introduce more technologically advanced products or lower cost products. In addition, we may agree to pricing concessions or extended payment terms with our customers in connection with penetrating new markets, volume orders or to improve cost of ownership in highly competitive applications. Our business, financial condition, margins or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by competitive pressure and price-based competition.\nRevenues are Largely Based on the Sale of a Small Number of Product Units\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of products. Accordingly, our revenues, margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors in addition to those described above, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the timing of orders and terms or acceptance of product shipments by our customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of products and services that we sell;\n\u2022\ntiming and market acceptance of our new product introductions; and\n\u2022\ndelays or problems in the planned introduction of new products, or in the performance of any such products following delivery to customers.\nAs a result of these risks, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain and Production\nVariability of Production Capacity\nTo meet rapidly changing demand in the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively manage our supply chain. Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in product technology and to support and service our products. Conversely, when upturns occur in the markets we serve, we may have difficulty rapidly and effectively increasing our manufacturing capacity or procuring sufficient materials to meet sudden increases in customer demand that could result in the loss of business to our competitors and harm to our relationships with our customers. In addition, our new manufacturing capability with the acquisition of Topwin in China has not been proven at the high volumes we anticipate for that facility. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nReliance on Critical Suppliers\nWe use a wide range of components from numerous suppliers in the manufacture of our products, including custom electronic, laser, optical and mechanical components. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. We seek to reduce the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, some key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers in the short term. In addition, some of the lasers we use in our products are difficult to manufacture, and as a result we may not receive an adequate supply of lasers in a timely fashion to fill orders. Operations at our suppliers\u2019 facilities are subject to disruption or discontinuation for a variety of reasons, including changes in business relationships, competitive factors, financial difficulties, work stoppages, fire, natural disasters or other causes. Any such disruption or discontinuation to our suppliers\u2019 operations could interrupt or reduce our manufacturing activities and delay delivery of our products, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, when markets recover from economic downturns, there is a heightened risk that one or more of our suppliers may not be able to meet our increased demand requirements, adversely impacting our ability to fulfill orders and win business with our customers.\nUtilization of Contract Manufacturers\nWe have arrangements with contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing of certain of our product subcomponents. Any significant interruption in our contract manufacturers\u2019 ability to provide manufacturing services to us as a result of contractual disputes with us or another party, labor disruptions, financial difficulties, natural disasters, delay or interruption in the receipt of inventory, customer prioritization or other causes could result in reduced manufacturing capabilities or delayed deliveries for certain of our products, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCharges for Excess or Obsolete Inventory\nOne factor on which we compete is the ability to ship products on schedules required by customers. In order to facilitate timely shipping, management forecasts demand, both in type and amount of products, and these forecasts are used to determine inventory to be purchased. We also order materials based on our technology roadmap, which represents management\u2019s assessment of technology that will be utilized in new products that we develop. Certain types of inventory, including lasers and optical equipment, are particularly expensive and may only be used in the production of a single type of product. If actual demand is lower than forecast with respect to the type or amount of products actually ordered, or both, our inventory levels may increase. As a result, there is a risk that we may have to incur material accounting charges for excess and obsolete inventory if inventory cannot be used, which would negatively affect our financial results. Also, if we alter our technology or product development strategy, we may have inventory that may not be usable under the new strategy, which may also result in material accounting charges. For example, during 2016, we recorded approximately $1.4 million of charges in cost of sales for inventory written off associated with discontinued products.\nUncertainties Resulting from Conflict Minerals Regulation\nMany countries, including the United States and those in the European Union and China, have implemented directives that restrict the sale of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain hazardous substances, and require a disclosure if certain metals used in products are not from a conflict free source.\nRisks Related to Our Organization\nOperating a Global Business\nInternational shipments accounted for 90% of net shipments in 2016, with 83% of our net shipments to customers in Asia. We expect that international shipments will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future. We also have significant foreign operations, including manufacturing facilities in Singapore and China, research and application development facilities in Canada, France, China and Korea, and sales and service offices in various countries. Under our globalization strategy, we intend to increase our foreign operations in the future. Our non-U.S. sales, purchases and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, many of which are outside our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nperiodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions;\n\u2022\nprice and currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nfluctuation in the relative values of currencies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in repatriating money, whether as a result of tax laws or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndifficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\ncompliance with labor laws and other laws governing employees;\n\u2022\nlocal labor disputes;\n\u2022\nshipping delays and disruptions;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in trading policies, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, collecting accounts receivable, and managing suppliers, distributors and representatives.\nOur business and operating results could also be impacted, directly or indirectly, by natural disasters, outbreaks of infectious disease, military action, international conflicts, terrorist activities, civil unrest and associated political instability. Many of our facilities, including our Portland, Oregon headquarters, are in areas with known earthquake risk. Some of these events or circumstances may also result in heightened security concerns with respect to domestic and international travel and commerce, which may further affect our business and operating results. In particular, due to these uncertainties, we are subject to the following additional risks:\n\u2022\nfuture tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non-U.S. engineers and other key technical employees in our U.S. facilities or our ability to hire new non-U.S. employees in such facilities;\n\u2022\nmore frequent instances of shipping delays;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products may not increase or may decrease; and\n\u2022\nour customers or suppliers may experience financial difficulties or cease operations.\nImplementation and Modification of Globalization Strategy\nWe are continuing to implement and expand our globalization strategy in which we are moving certain operational resources and capabilities to different countries in Asia to be closer to many of our significant customers to reduce costs and to develop low-cost follow-on solutions to our products. As part of this strategy, we opened a manufacturing facility in Singapore in the fourth quarter of 2010, which manufactures certain IP, MP, SP and CTP products and is now our primary system manufacturing facility. We also acquired Topwin, a Chinese manufacturer of laser-based systems, in January 2015 to gain entry into the low-cost solutions market in China. In 2016, we opened an applications development center in Korea in order to increase responsiveness and increase access to local customers.\nWe believe this strategy will enhance customer relationships, improve our responsiveness, reduce our manufacturing costs for certain products and allow us to compete with low-cost competitors, including those who develop systems employing processes developed by us.\nOur globalization strategy is subject to a variety of complexities and risks, many of which may divert a substantial amount of management\u2019s time. These risks include:\n\u2022\nchallenges in designing facilities that can be scaled for future expansion, replicating current processes and bringing new facilities up to full operation;\n\u2022\nunpredictable costs, redundancy costs and cost overruns for developing facilities and acquiring equipment;\n\u2022\nbuilding local management teams, technical personnel and other staff for functions that we have not previously conducted outside of the United States;\n\u2022\ntechnical obstacles such as poor production or process yield and loss of quality control during the ramp of a new facility;\n\u2022\nre-qualifications and other procedures that may be required by our customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to bring up local suppliers to meet our quality and cycle-time needs;\n\u2022\nour ability to reduce costs in the United States as we add costs elsewhere;\n\u2022\nrapidly changing business conditions that may require plans to be changed or abandoned before they are fully implemented; and\n\u2022\nchallenges posed by distance and by differences in language and culture.\nThese and other factors could delay the continuing development, expansion and implementation of our strategy, as well as impair our gross margins, delay shipments and deliveries, cause us to lose sales, require us to write off investments already made, damage our reputation and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we decide to change our globalization strategy, we may incur charges for certain costs incurred. For example, the Company announced a restructuring plan in 2015 which led to the impairment of associated leasehold improvements and other assets for our Chelmsford facility. The estimated future liability associated with the lease commitments was accrued net of estimated sublease rental income. However, to the extent the property is vacated or payments are not made by the sub-lessee, the Company will incur the full amounts of the ongoing lease obligation.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nWe may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, other businesses with complementary products, services or technologies, such as our June 2012 acquisition of Eolite Systems, our May 2013 acquisition of the Semiconductor Systems business from GSI Group, Inc. and our January 2015 acquisition of Topwin. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of personnel, operations, technologies and products of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in implementation of our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system into the acquired company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other operational matters;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nlack of synergy or inability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully enter new markets expected to result from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nacquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulties establishing satisfactory internal controls and accounting practices at the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulties implementing internal manufacturing processes at the acquired company;\n\u2022\nrisks related to the culture, language, and local practices of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nrisks and uncertainties relating to the performance of the combined company following the transaction; and\n\u2022\nacquiring unanticipated liabilities for which we will not be indemnified.\nFurthermore, the accounting for an acquisition could result in significant charges resulting from amortization or write-off of intangible assets and goodwill we acquire. Our inability to effectively manage these risks or lower levels of revenue, profitability or cash flows for acquired businesses and assets could result in our inability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition on a timely basis, or at all, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, all acquisition transaction costs must be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe means by which we finance an acquisition may also significantly affect our business or the value of the shares of our common stock. If we issue common stock to pay for an acquisition, the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders will be diluted and the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders could be reduced. If we use cash on hand to pay for an acquisition, the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes. If we borrow funds in connection with an acquisition, we would be required to use cash to service the debt and to comply with financial and other covenants.\nSecurity Breaches\nWe store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other actions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nHiring and Retention of Personnel\nOur continued success depends in part upon the services of our key managerial, financial and technical personnel. The loss of key personnel, or our inability to attract, assimilate and retain qualified personnel, could result in the loss of customers, inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have previously had to, and may in the future have to, impose salary reductions on employees during economic\ndownturns in an effort to maintain our financial position. On several occasions in recent years executives and other employees have received limited or no annual bonuses due to our financial performance relative to the performance parameters in our annual bonus plans. These events may have an adverse effect on employee loyalty and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries and locations in which we compete for talent is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel, which could affect our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Technology\nMarkets Characterized by Rapid Technological Change\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Our future performance will depend on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address technological changes and the requirements of current and potential customers. The development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process, requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely basis. The introduction by us or by our competitors of new or enhanced products, or alternative technologies, may cause our customers to defer, change or cancel orders for our existing products or cease purchasing our products altogether. Further, we cannot assure that our new products will gain timely market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors, technology changes or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to develop new or enhanced products to address product or technology changes or new industry standards on a timely basis or at all, or if our new or enhanced products are not accepted by the market, or if our customers adopt alternative technologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nNeed to Invest in Research and Development\nOur industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development. Because of intense competition in the industries in which we compete, if we were to fail to invest sufficiently in research and development, our products could become less attractive to our current and potential customers or obsolete, and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of our need to maintain our spending levels in this area, our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales decline. In addition, as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation, our operating costs may increase in the future, and research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of net sales.\nNeed to Broaden our Marketing and Channel Capability\nThe laser microfabrication industry is comprised of broad set of markets and applications and represents significant opportunities for growth. In order to access these opportunities, we are broadening our approach from customer centric to market based. This will require the hiring, development, and application of new marketing capability and channel access. Our ability to successfully access and compete in these broader markets will be partially dependent on our development of these new skills and capabilities. Our inability to do so would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nProducts are Highly Complex\nOur products are highly complex, and our extensive product development, manufacturing and testing processes may not be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us. As a result, we may have to replace certain components or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products after they are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers and other losses to us or to our customers. These occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, loss of sales and increased expenses and warranty costs, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nRisks Related to Legal Matters\nProtection of Proprietary Rights - Generally\nOur success depends significantly upon the protection of our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our proprietary rights through patents, copyrights, trademarks, maintenance of trade secrets and other measures, including entering into confidentiality agreements. We incur substantial costs to obtain and maintain patents and to defend our intellectual property rights. We rely upon the laws of the United States and foreign countries where we develop, manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights. We may not be successful in protecting these proprietary rights, these rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect, or other parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent these rights.\nProtection of Proprietary Rights - Foreign Jurisdictions\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States. Many United States companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in foreign countries, which could result in reduced sales and gross margins.\nIntellectual Property Infringement Claims\nSeveral of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies, applications and methods of use similar to some of those used in our products. While we attempt in our designs to avoid patent infringement, from time to time we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products, as used by our customers, may be infringing one or more of these patents. Competitors or others have in the past and may in the future assert infringement claims against our customers or us with respect to current or future products or uses, and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others. If claims of infringement are asserted against our customers, those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur.\nIf we become subject to infringement claims, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position. These licenses, however, may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also defend our patent and intellectual property portfolio. For example, we initiated litigation in 2014 against Humo Laboratory, LTD. in Japan and against Eo Technics Co., Ltd., in South Korea in for infringement of key patents. There is no assurance that this litigation will be successful, and we may incur significant legal fees to prosecute these claims.\nTax Audits and Changes in Tax Law\nWe are periodically under audit by United States and foreign tax authorities and may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a result. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and the impact of changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws could result in material differences from what is reflected in historical income tax accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an examination, a material effect on our financial results, tax positions or cash flows could occur in the period or periods in which the determination is made.\nWe currently benefit from a tax incentive program in Singapore pursuant to which we pay no Singapore income tax with respect to our manufacturing income. The incentive period ends on June 30, 2016. While the Company has failed to meet certain of the associated requirements for the incentive in the past, it has obtained a waiver for certain periods and believes that it is more likely than not the Company will continue to receive the associated tax incentives for balance of the incentive period. Although the Company has applied for an extension of benefits beyond the incentive period, there is no assurance that these benefits will be extended.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings, including breach of contract claims and claims that involve possible infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties or by third parties. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of litigation matters, and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any litigation. Any litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management\u2019s attention, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse determinations in such litigation could result in loss of our property rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses from others or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nProvisions Restricting Our Acquisition\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. In addition, the Oregon Control Share Act and the Oregon Business Combination Act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us. These provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of our Board of Directors, may deter efforts to obtain control of us and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nLiquidity\nWe may require greater working capital to operate than similar size businesses in many other industries. At April 2, 2016, we had working capital of $127 million, including $58 million in cash and short-term investments. Our operating cash flows were negative for most quarters since September 2013 through March 2015. In 2016 we had positive operating cash flows with revenue growth driving operating cash flows of $4.7 million. If revenues were to grow, we would expect increased working capital needs for receivables and inventory.\nAs of April 2, 2016, we have permanently reinvested $37.0 million of foreign earnings primarily related to manufacturing operations in Singapore and China (Topwin). The Company\u2019s net investment exposure in foreign subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rates at April 2, 2016 and March 28, 2015 was approximately $56.9 million and $64.3 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $5.7 million and $6.4 million at April 2, 2016 and March 28, 2015, respectively. Foreign exchange rate gains or losses on foreign investments as of April 2, 2016 were reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment, net of tax, and do not affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nWhile we have a credit facility in place, the level of availability and cost are based on maintaining certain levels of qualified receivables and domestic cash. As a result, if either of these balances decreases significantly, our ability to access the facility may be limited or costs may be higher. In addition, if we fail to meet the covenants in our credit facility, including the tangible net worth covenant, the facility may not be available to us. If we were to require additional financing, there is no assurance it would be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In addition, if we were to obtain financing by selling stock or convertible securities, the ownership of existing shareholders would be diluted. If we were to require additional financing and were unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all, our business and our ability to continue operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, most of our contracts to acquire inventory represent purchase commitments. As a result, if we experience lower than anticipated demand for our products, in many cases we would not be able to avoid the cost of purchasing the associated inventory, which could negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nUnfavorable Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to those customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our foreign sales are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency we receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the value of accounts receivable primarily denominated in euros and other currencies. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFluctuations in Effective Tax Rate\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation from one period to the next because the income tax rates for each year are a function of many factors, including: (a) taxable income levels and the effects of a mix of profits (losses) earned by ESI and our subsidiaries in numerous tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates; (b) our ability to utilize deferred tax assets; (c) taxes, refunds, interest or penalties resulting from tax audits; (d) the magnitude of various credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income; (e) the ability to maintain our Pioneer Status in Singapore; and (f) changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. In addition, we currently have a valuation allowance against domestic tax assets as a result of historic losses recorded in the United States. Changes in the mix of these items may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible and Long-Lived Assets\nWe held a total of $7.1 million in acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, and $7.4 million in goodwill at April 2, 2016. Events may occur or circumstances change such that the carrying value is not recoverable or it becomes more likely than not that the fair value of long-lived assets is reduced below the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nFor example, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we realigned our products into two segments as a result of changes in our go-to-market strategies, common customer characteristics, and information utilized to manage our business. This reorganization\nrequired the Company to reassign goodwill to the new reporting units based on the relative fair value of the respective reporting units, and as a result we concluded that $7.9 million of goodwill was impaired as of March 28, 2015.\nWe performed a review of our acquired definite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2016, including a review for impairment based on certain triggering events and no significant impairments of intangible assets were identified, other than a $0.4 million intangible associated with developed technology for our Topwin reporting unit. We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis of the associated reporting unit and determined that the goodwill was not impaired. The estimated fair value of the Topwin reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by approximately $1.7 million or over 18%. The assessment of whether goodwill is impaired is sensitive to many financial and valuation assumptions, including projections of future performance, the determination of weighted average cost of capital, and estimates of terminal value. Our projections include assumptions regarding the adoption of new products, expected margins, and other factors, and a significant deterioration or deviation between expectations and actual performance may trigger impairment. For example, should the performance of our Topwin reporting unit not meet our expectations, impairment of goodwill associated with that reporting unit may be triggered, which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, certain of our long-lived assets such as machinery and equipment may experience impairment as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. We depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStock Price Volatility\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. During fiscal 2016, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $7.36 per share and a low of $4.21 per share. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors affecting our stock price, many of which are outside of our control, may include:\n\u2022\nvariations in operating results from quarter to quarter;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market price per share of our public company customers;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the consumer electronics, semiconductor and other industries into which we sell products;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical changes, hostilities or natural disasters;\n\u2022\nlow trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe number of analysts covering our common stock;\n\u2022\nbeing added or removed from market indices;\n\u2022\npolicies of institutional investors restricting or prohibiting investments in stock with a market price below certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nstock price volatility based on one or a few investors buying or selling a large number of shares over days or weeks, due to relatively low volumes of trading in our stock; and\n\u2022\nthe number of firms making a market in our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high-technology companies like ours. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nImpairment of Investments\nOur investment portfolio is primarily comprised of commercial paper, debt securities issued by U.S. governmental agencies and municipal debt securities. These investments are intended to be highly liquid and low risk. If the markets for these securities were to deteriorate for any reason, including as a result of a downgrade in the credit rating of U.S. government securities, the liquidity and value of these investments could be negatively affected, which could result in impairment charges. Any such impairment charges may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed.\nIn connection with our 2015 audit we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting and disclosure of complex, judgmental accounting matters and non-routine transactions. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses included the risk\nassessment and certain process and review level controls associated with complex and non-routine transactions affecting goodwill, disclosures related to the Topwin acquisition, disclosures related to operating segments, and presentation of service revenue and associated cost of sales on the statements of operations.\nManagement believes that it has identified and implemented additional controls, which have remediated these material weaknesses.\nThe requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are ongoing and also apply to future years. We expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops. Although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Therefore, we cannot be certain that in the future additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. If such weaknesses or deficiencies occur, they could result in misstatements of our results of operations, additional restatements of our consolidated financial statements, a decline in our stock price and investor confidence, or other material effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 32054, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "ESIO"}
