{"cik": "897429", "company": "CHICOS FAS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves certain risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company, and the risks described herein are not listed in order of the potential occurrence or severity. There is no assurance that we have identified, assessed and appropriately addressed all risks affecting our business operations. Additional risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business and our results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, and the market price for our shares could decline. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below are cautionary statements, identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. There can also be no assurance that the actual future results, performance, benefits or achievements that we expect from our strategies, systems, initiatives or products will occur.\nBusiness Strategy\nIf we cannot successfully execute our business strategy, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. There are numerous risks associated with this strategy including, but not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n1. Failure to implement and manage our business strategy\nOur long-term omni-channel business strategy is dependent upon a number of factors, including anticipating and quickly responding to changing customer preferences, shopping habits (such as online versus in-store) and fashion trends, identifying and developing new brand extensions, markets and channels of distribution, effectively using our marketing resources to communicate with existing and potential customers, effectively managing our store base, including management of store productivity and negotiating acceptable lease terms, effectively managing our wholesale licensing and franchising relationships to optimize sales and margin and to protect our brands, having the appropriate corporate resources to support our business strategies, sourcing levels of inventory in line with expected sales and then managing its disposition, hiring, training and retaining qualified employees, generating sufficient operating cash flows to fund our business strategies, maintaining brand-specific websites that offer the system functionality, service and security customers expect, and correctly identifying, implementing and maintaining appropriate technology to support our business strategies.\n2. Competition\nThe women's specialty retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national and international department stores, specialty and discount stores, catalogs and internet businesses offering similar categories of merchandise. Many of our competitors have advantages over us, including substantially greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources. Increased levels of promotional activity by our competitors, some of whom may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can, both online and in stores, may negatively impact our sales and profitability. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully with these companies in the future. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for store and online traffic, for favorable store locations and lease terms and for qualified associates. The growth of fast fashion, value fashion retailers and expansion of off-price retailers has shifted shopper expectations to more affordable pricing of well-known brands and has contributed to continued promotional pressure as well as a shift in customers\u2019 expectations with regard to the timing and costs of product deliveries and returns. If we do not identify and respond to these emerging trends in consumer spending as well as the growing preference of many customers for online e-commerce options, we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers. Increased competition in any of these areas may result in higher costs or otherwise reduce our sales or operating margins.\n3. Risks of expanding internationally\nOur current growth strategy includes potential expansion of our operations and presence internationally. As part of that strategy, we may face unanticipated and significant costs and challenges in setting up foreign offices, hiring experienced management or franchising partners, negotiating profitable licensing or franchising agreements, obtaining prime locations for stores, introducing and marketing our brands, and others.\nWe may be unable to successfully grow our international business, or we may face operational issues or resource constraints that delay our intended pace of international growth, such as an inability to identify suitable franchising partners, to identify profitable markets for our brands and sites for store locations, to anticipate and address the different operational or cultural challenges presented in a new country, to find vendors that can meet our international merchandise needs, to provide adequate resource and system support through our shared service model, to achieve acceptable operating margins, compete with local competitors or adapt to different consumer demand and behavior. Any challenges that we encounter may divert financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain U.S. laws that may impact our international operations or expansion, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Violations of these laws could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nNumerous economic conditions, all of which are outside of our control, could negatively affect the level of our customers' spending or our costs of operations. If these economic conditions persist for a sustained period, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. These economic conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n4. Declines in consumer spending\nConsumer spending in our sector may decline as a result of: threatened or actual government shut downs, higher unemployment levels, low levels of consumer credit, declines in consumer confidence, inflation, changes in interest rates, recessionary pressures, increasing gas and other energy costs, increased taxes, changes in housing prices, higher durable goods or other consumer spending, volatility in the financial markets and changes in the political climate or conditions.\n5. Fluctuating costs\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics and other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor and transportation, may contribute to ongoing pricing pressures throughout our supply chain. The price and availability of such inputs to the manufacturing process may fluctuate significantly, depending on several factors, including commodity costs (such as higher cotton prices), energy costs (such as fuel), shipping costs, inflationary pressures from emerging markets, increased labor costs, weather conditions and currency fluctuations.\n6. Impairment charges\nSignificant negative industry or general economic trends, changes in customer demand for our product, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our operating results or use of long-lived assets (such as boutique relocations or discontinuing use of certain boutique fixtures) may result in impairments to goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.\n7. Fluctuating comparable sales and operating results\nOur comparable sales and overall operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. In addition to other factors discussed in this Item 1A., a variety of factors affect comparable sales and operating results, including changes in fashion trends, changes in our merchandise mix, customer acceptance of merchandise offerings, the timing of marketing activities, calendar shifts of holiday periods, the periodic impact of a fifty-three week fiscal year, weather conditions and general economic conditions. In addition, our ability to address the current challenges of sustained declining store traffic combined with a highly promotional retail environment may impact our comparable sales, operating results and ability to maintain or gain market share. Past comparable sales or operating results are not an indicator of future results.\nOmni-Channel Operations\nOur omni-channel operations (including our websites and catalogs) are a critical part of our customers\u2019 overall experience with our brands and will be a significant contributor to our future business growth and profitability. Our inability or failure to successfully manage and maintain those operations could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Specific risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n8. Reliance on technology\nOur brands\u2019 websites and select systems are heavily dependent on technology, which creates numerous risks including unanticipated operating problems, system failures, rapid technological change, failure of technology to operate the websites and systems as anticipated, reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, liability for online content, systems and data breaches, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing attacks, computer hackers and other similar disruptions. Our failure to successfully assess and respond to these risks could negatively impact sales, increase costs, inhibit our ability to acquire new customers and damage the reputation of our brands.\n9. Reliance on the U.S. Postal Service and other shipping vendors\nPostal rate increases or a reduction or delay in service could affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalog and promotional mailings. We use the Postal Service to mail millions of catalogs each year to educate our customers about our products, acquire new customers, drive customers to our boutiques and websites and promote catalog sales. We rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting.\nWe utilize additional shipping vendors to support our online operations. Any significant and unanticipated increase in shipping costs, reduction in service, or slow-down in delivery could impair our ability to deliver merchandise in a timely or economically efficient manner.\n10. Inability to successfully launch other channels of sales, marketing and distribution\nOur strategic plans include additional channels for the marketing and sale of our product and brands, including through licensing, wholesaling, franchising and alternative distribution models. Each of these methods presents new operational, reputational and financial challenges for us. Our inability to find the right markets, partners or business models, our inability to negotiate agreements that protect our profit and brand quality and reputation, or our inability to accurately anticipate the resources, systems and operational needs that go along with these new ventures could result in lower than expected returns and adversely impact other areas of our business.\nInformation Technology Systems\nIn addition to the dependence of our retail websites on technology as discussed above, we also rely on various information technology systems to manage our overall operations, and failure of those systems to operate as expected or a significant interruption in service could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n11. Disruptions in current systems or difficulties in integrating new systems\nWe regularly maintain, upgrade, enhance or replace our information technology systems to support our business strategies and provide business continuity. Replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality have inherent risks including disruptions, delays, gaps in functionality, user acceptance, adequate user training or other difficulties that may impair the effectiveness of our information technology systems.\n12. Cybersecurity/ Data Privacy\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack, exfiltration, loss or damage. Our business involves the storage and/or transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, shipping preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information regarding our business, employees and third parties. In addition, as part of our acceptance of customers\u2019 debit and credit cards as forms of payment, we are required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI\u201d) as well as other laws and regulations, both foreign and in the United States.\nWhile we have implemented measures reasonably designed to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, and while we have taken steps to comply with PCI and other laws, those measures may not be effective. A breach or cyber incident could result in the loss or misuse of data and could result in fines, penalties, damages, loss of business, legal expenses, remediation costs, reputational damage or loss of our ability to accept debit and credit cards as forms for payment. In addition, changes in laws or regulations, or in the PCI standards, could result in cost increases due to system or administrative charges.\nSourcing and Distribution Strategies\nOur sourcing and distribution strategies are subject to numerous risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n13. Reliance on foreign sources of production\nThe majority of the merchandise we sell is produced outside the United States. As a result, our business remains subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: geo-political instability, non-compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, potential changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements, imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas, imposition of new or increased duties, taxes, or other charges on imports, foreign exchange rate challenges and pressures presented by implementation of U.S. monetary policy, challenges from local business practices or political issues, transportation disruptions, our shift to a predominantly FOB (free on board) shipping structure rather than predominantly DDP (delivered duty paid), natural disasters, delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations or government funding; seizure or detention of goods by U.S. Customs authorities, or a reduction in the availability of shipping sources caused by industry consolidation or other reasons. We continue to source a substantial portion of our merchandise from Asia, including China. A change in exchange rates, labor laws or policies affecting the costs of goods in Asia could negatively impact our merchandise costs. Furthermore, delays in production or shipping product, whether due to work slow-downs, work stoppages, strikes, port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations and customs inspections or other factors, could have a negative impact.\nWe cannot predict whether or not any of the foreign countries in which our clothing and accessories are produced will be subject to import restrictions or taxes by the United States government. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs, or more restrictive quotas, including safeguard quotas, or anything similar, applicable to apparel items could affect the importation of apparel generally and, in that event, could increase the cost, or reduce the supply, of apparel available to us.\n14. Our suppliers\u2019 inability to provide quality goods in a timely manner\nWe are subject to risk because we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise. A key supplier may become unable to address our merchandising needs for a variety of reasons. If we were unexpectedly required to change suppliers or if a key supplier were unable to supply acceptable merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms, we could experience a significant impact to the supply or cost of merchandise.\n15. Reliance upon one supplier\nApproximately 23% of total purchases in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were made from one supplier, and we cannot guarantee that this relationship will be maintained in the future or that the supplier will continue to be available to supply merchandise. However, we have no material long-term or exclusive contract with any apparel or accessory manufacturer or supplier. Our business depends on our network of suppliers and our continued good relations with them.\n16. Our suppliers\u2019 failure to implement acceptable labor practices\nAlthough we have adopted our Terms of Commitment to Ethical Sourcing and use the services of third party audit firms to monitor compliance with these terms, some of our independent suppliers may not be in complete compliance with our guidelines at all times. The violation of labor or other laws by any of our key independent suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted by us as ethical could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished merchandise or damage our reputation.\n17. Reliance on one location to distribute goods for our brands\nWith minor exceptions, the distribution functions for all of our brands are handled from our DC in Winder, Georgia and a significant interruption in the operation of that facility due to natural disasters, severe weather, accidents, system failures, capacity constraints or other unforeseen causes could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and/or fulfill online or catalog orders.\nOther Risks Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous other risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisk\nDescription\n18. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to help us comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws, accounting and reporting requirements, regulations and tax requirements, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), as well as applicable employment and data security laws and various applicable laws in foreign jurisdictions. We could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event of our failure to comply, which could be expensive to defend and resolve and be disruptive to our business. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects us may increase the complexity of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance.\n19. Adverse outcomes of litigation matters\nWe are involved in litigation and other claims against our business. These matters arise primarily in the ordinary course of business but could raise complex factual and legal issues, presenting multiple risks and uncertainties and requiring significant management time. Our assessment could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to pending or potential legal actions against us, not presently known to us, or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are inconsistent with our evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation. In addition, we may be subject to litigation which has not yet been filed.\n20. Our inability to retain or recruit key personnel\nOur success and ability to properly manage our business depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, including executive and senior management and talented merchants. Competition for talented employees within our industry is intense. Failure to recruit and retain such personnel and implement appropriate succession planning, including the transition of new executives, particularly at the senior executive level, could jeopardize our continued and sustained success.\n21. Our inability to achieve the results of our strategic initiatives\nOver the last two years, we have launched significant initiatives designed to reposition our brands, drive sales, acquire new customers, establish new channels of distribution and further align the organizational structure for long-term growth. These initiatives require substantial internal change and effort, including reductions and changes in personnel and significant adjustments in how we design and source product and how we ultimately present and sell it to our customers. These initiatives may not deliver all of the results we expect. Moreover, the process of implementing them places significant stress on the Company and could result in unexpected short-term interruptions or negative impacts to our business, such as disruptions to our current business processes as we migrate to the new processes, or failure to successfully migrate to those new processes, which could negatively impact product flow, product quality or inventory levels.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we can complete the implementation of all of these initiatives in the manner or in the time-frame planned, or that, once implemented, they will result in the expected increases in the efficiency or productivity of our business.\n22. Our inability to operate our business within our financial covenants or to replace our credit facility\nOur revolving credit agreement and term loan contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens, engage in mergers, make certain investments, pay dividends or distributions on our common stock or enter into sales-leaseback transactions. The agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The ability of the Company to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the Company's repayment obligations. Also, the inability to obtain credit on commercially reasonable terms in the future when this facility expires could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, market conditions could potentially impact the size and terms of a replacement facility or facilities.\n23. War, terrorism or other catastrophes\nIn the event of war, acts of terrorism or the threat of terrorist attacks, public health crises or weather catastrophes, consumer spending could significantly decrease for a sustained period. In addition, local authorities or shopping center management could close stores in response to any immediate security concern, public health concern or weather catastrophe such as hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes. Similarly, war, acts of terrorism, threats of terrorist attacks or a weather catastrophe could severely and adversely affect our National Store Support Center (\u201cNSSC\u201d) campus, our DC, or our entire supply chain.\n24. Our inability to protect our brands\u2019 reputation\nOur ability to protect our brands\u2019 reputations is an integral part of our general success strategy and is critical to the overall value of the brands. If we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity in our business conduct or fail to address other risk factors, such failures could jeopardize our brands' reputations. Consumers value readily available information from social media and other sources concerning retailers and their goods and services and many times act on such information without further investigation in regards to its accuracy. Any negative publicity, whether true or not, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease customer and investor loyalty and affect our vendor relationships.\n25. Our inability to protect our intellectual property\nWhile we devote significant resources to the protection of our intellectual property, others may still attempt to imitate our products or infringe upon our intellectual property rights. Other parties may also claim that some of our products infringe on their trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices in many foreign countries can be substantially different from those in the United States. There are also inherent challenges with enforcing intellectual property rights on third party e-commerce websites, especially those based in foreign jurisdictions. We cannot guarantee that such rights are not infringed.\n26. Stock price volatility\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Future announcements or management discussions concerning us or our competitors, sales and profitability results, quarterly variations in operating results or comparable sales, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or the failure of investors or analysts to understand our business strategies or fundamental changes in our business or sector, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, stock market have experienced periods of extreme price or volume volatility in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.\n27. Our business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal and business challenges in the operation of our Company due to proxy contests, shareholder proposals, media campaigns and other such actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions is costly and time-consuming, disrupts our operations, may not align with our business strategies and may divert the attention of our Board of Directors and management from the pursuit of current business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of instability in the organization and its future and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\n28. Disadvantageous lease obligations and commercial retail consolidation\nWe have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to fulfill our obligations under the applicable lease including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Additionally, continued consolidation in the commercial retail real estate market could affect our ability to successfully negotiate favorable rental terms for our stores in the future and could concentrate our leases with fewer landlords who may then be in a position to dictate unfavorable terms to us due to their significant negotiating leverage. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close this could affect our ability to profitably operate our stores.", "PERMNO": 78963, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "CHS"}
