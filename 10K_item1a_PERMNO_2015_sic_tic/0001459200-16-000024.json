{"cik": "1459200", "company": "Alarm.com Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including revenue related to the product mix that we sell, including the relative sales related to our platform and solutions and other factors which are outside of our control. If our quarterly revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe portion of our revenue attributable to software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and license versus hardware and other sales;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand, including due to seasonality, for our platform and solutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing by us in response to competitive pricing actions;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase, retain and incentivize the service providers that market, sell, install and support our platform and solutions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our hardware vendors to continue to manufacture high-quality products and to supply sufficient products to meet our demands;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of introductions of new solutions, products or upgrades by us or our competitors and the entrance of new competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our business and pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe ability to accurately forecast revenue as we generally rely upon our service provider network to generate new revenue;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the hardware we purchase;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully manage any future acquisitions of businesses;\n\u2022\nissues related to introductions of new or improved products such as shortages of prior generation products or short-term decreased demand for next generation products;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of expenditures, including those related to expanding our operations, increasing research and development, introducing new solutions or paying litigation expenses;\n\u2022\nthe ability to effectively manage growth within existing and new markets domestically and abroad;\n\u2022\nchanges in the payment terms for our platform and solutions;\n\u2022\nthe strength of regional, national and global economies; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of natural disasters or manmade problems such as terrorism.\nDue to the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this Annual Report, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. You should not consider our recent revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth or results of one quarter as indicative of our future performance.\nWe may not sustain our growth rate and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively.\nWe have experienced significant growth in a short period of time. Our revenue increased from $37.2 million in 2010 to $208.9 million in 2015. We do not expect to achieve similar growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. If we are unable to maintain expected revenue growth in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of prior period revenue, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline.\nOur future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our anticipated expansion and growth. To manage our growth successfully and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintain our relationships with existing service providers and add new service providers;\n\u2022\nincrease our subscribers and help our service providers maintain and improve their revenue retention rates, while also expanding their cross-sell effectiveness;\n\u2022\nadd sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nexpand our international operations; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls.\nWe intend to increase our investment in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions and other areas to grow our business. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements to our existing solutions and we may fail to satisfy subscriber and service provider requirements, maintain the quality of our solutions, execute on our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in our financial results suffering and a decline in our stock price.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.\nWe increased our number of full-time employees from 253 to 400 to 507 at December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our revenue increased from $130.2 million in 2013 to $167.3 million in 2014 to $208.9 million in 2015. Our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to further expand our overall business, service provider network, subscriber base, headcount and operations. Creating a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross profit or operating expenses in any particular quarter. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract service providers and consumers.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, broadband and security service providers and other managed service providers, are actively targeting the home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management markets. If we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe compete in several markets, including home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management. The markets in which we participate are highly competitive and competition may intensify in the future.\nOur ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour platform and solutions\u2019 functionality, performance, ease of use, reliability, availability and cost effectiveness relative to that of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nour success in utilizing new and proprietary technologies to offer solutions and features previously not available in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nour success in identifying new markets, applications and technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain service providers;\n\u2022\nour name recognition and reputation;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit software engineers and sales and marketing personnel; and\n\u2022\nour ability to protect our intellectual property.\nConsumers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. In the event a consumer decides to evaluate a new home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring or energy management solution, the consumer may be more inclined to select one of our competitors whose product offerings are broader than those that we offer.\nOur current primary competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected home, including iControl Networks, Inc. and Honeywell International Inc., that sell to service providers such as cable operators and other home automation providers. In addition, our service providers compete with managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and security companies like Comcast Corporation, AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Cable Inc., and providers of point products, including Nest Labs, Inc. (acquired by Google Inc.), which offers a thermostat, and Nest Cam (acquired by Nest Labs, Inc.), which offers video monitoring. Because our service providers compete with these entities, we consider them competitive. For example, several cable and telecommunications companies have introduced home automation and security services packages, including interactive security services, which are competitive with our platform and solutions. In addition, we may compete with other large technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market. For example, Apple, Inc. introduced a feature in 2014 that allows some manufacturers\u2019 devices to be controlled through a service available in Apple's iOS operating system.\nMost of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. In addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business.\nAggressive business tactics by our competitors may reduce our revenue.\nIncreased competition in the markets in which we compete may result in aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including:\n\u2022\nselling at a discount;\n\u2022\noffering products similar to our platform and solutions on a bundled basis at no charge;\n\u2022\nannouncing competing products combined with extensive marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nproviding financing incentives to consumers; and\n\u2022\nasserting intellectual property rights irrespective of the validity of the claims.\nOur service providers may switch and offer the products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. Competition from other companies may also adversely affect our negotiations with service providers and suppliers, including, in some cases, requiring us to lower our prices. Opportunities to take market share using innovative products, services and sales approaches may also attract new entrants to the field. We may not be able to compete successfully with the offerings and sales tactics of other companies, which could result in the loss of service providers offering our platform and solutions and, as a result, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or if our current or future competitors employ aggressive business tactics, including those described above, demand for our platform and solutions could decline, we could experience cancellations of our services to consumers, or we could be required to reduce our prices or increase our expenses.\nThe proper and efficient functioning of our network operations centers and data back-up systems is central to our solutions.\nOur solutions operate with a cloud-based architecture and we update our solutions regularly while our solutions are operating. If our solutions and/or upgrades fail to operate properly, our solutions could stop functioning for a period of time, which could put our users at risk. Our ability to keep our business operating is highly dependent on the proper and efficient operation of our network operations centers and data back-up systems. Although our network operations centers have back-up computer and power systems, if there is a catastrophic event, natural disaster, terrorist attacks, security breach or other extraordinary event, we may be unable to provide our subscribers with uninterrupted monitoring service. Furthermore, because data back-up systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions (including those due to equipment damage, power outages, human error, computer viruses, computer hacking, data corruption and a range of other hardware, software and network problems), we cannot guarantee that we will not experience data back-up failures in the future. A significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of our network operations centers or data back-up systems could adversely affect our ability to keep our operations running efficiently. If a malfunction results in a wider or sustained disruption, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe sell security and life safety solutions and if our solutions fail for any reason, we could be subject to liability and our business could suffer.\nWe sell security and life safety solutions, which are designed to secure the safety of our subscribers and their residences or business. If these solutions fail for any reason, including due to defects in our software, a carrier outage, a failure of our network operating center, a failure on the part of our service providers or user error, we could be subject to liability for such failures and our business could suffer.\nOur platform and solutions may contain undetected defects in the software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes. If our platform or solutions suffer from defects, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or service providers or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the defects. We may find defects in new or upgraded solutions, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our platform and solutions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSince solutions that enable our platform are installed by our service providers, if they do not install or maintain such solutions correctly, our platform and solutions may not function properly. If the improper installation or maintenance of our platform and solutions leads to service failures after introduction of, or an upgrade to, our platform or a solution, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or service providers or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the problem. Further, we rely on our service providers to provide the primary source of support and ongoing service to our subscribers and, if our service providers fail to provide an adequate level of support and services to our subscribers, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny defect in, or disruption to, our platform and solutions could cause consumers not to purchase additional solutions from us, prevent potential consumers from purchasing our platform and solutions or harm our reputation. Although our contracts with our service providers limit our liability to our service providers for these defects, disruptions or errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our service providers or our subscribers, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration, or to pay significant settlements or damages. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly, divert management's attention and affect our ability to obtain or maintain liability insurance on acceptable terms and could harm our business. Although we currently maintain some warranty reserves, we cannot assure you that these warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover future liabilities.\nWe rely on our service provider network to acquire additional subscribers, and the inability of our service providers to attract additional subscribers or retain their current subscribers could adversely affect our operating results.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated through the sales of our platform and solutions by our service providers, and our service providers are responsible for subscriber acquisition, as well as providing customer service and technical support for our platform and solutions to the subscribers. We provide our service providers with specific training and programs to assist them in selling and providing support for our platform and solutions, but we cannot assure that these steps will be effective. In addition, we rely on our service providers to sell our platform and solutions into new markets in the intelligent and connected home space. If our service providers are unsuccessful in marketing, selling, and supporting our platform and solutions, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenues, we must effectively manage and grow relationships with our service providers. Recruiting and retaining qualified service providers and training them in our technology\nand solutions requires significant time and resources. If we fail to maintain existing service providers or develop relationships with new service providers, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, to execute on our strategy to expand our sales internationally, we must develop relationships with service providers that sell into these markets.\nAny of our service providers may choose to offer a product from one of our competitors instead of our platform and solutions, elect to develop their own competing solutions or simply discontinue their operations with us. For example, we entered into a license agreement in November 2013 with Vivint, Inc., or Vivint, pursuant to which we granted a license to use the intellectual property associated with our connected home solutions. Under the terms of this arrangement, Vivint has transitioned from selling our solutions directly to its customers to selling its own home automation product to its new customers. We now generate revenue from a monthly fee charged to Vivint on a per customer basis from sales of this service provider\u2019s product; however, these monthly fees are less on a per customer basis than fees from our SaaS solutions. Therefore, we receive less revenue on a per customer basis from Vivint compared to our SaaS subscriber base, which may result in a lower revenue growth rate. We must also work to expand our network of service providers to ensure that we have sufficient geographic coverage and technical expertise to address new markets and technologies. While it is difficult to estimate the total number of available service providers in our markets, there are a finite number of service providers that are able to perform the types of technical installations required for our platform and solutions. In the event that we saturate the available service provider pool, or if market or other forces cause the available pool of service providers to decline, it may be increasingly difficult to grow our business. If we are unable to expand our network of service providers, our business could be harmed.\nAs the consumers\u2019 product and service options grow, it is important that we enhance our service provider footprint by broadening the expertise of our service providers, working with larger and more sophisticated service providers and expanding the mainstream solutions our service providers offer. If we do not succeed in this effort, our current and potential future service providers may be unable or unwilling to broaden their offerings to include our connected home solution, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of service providers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our major service providers would result in decreased revenue and profitability.\nOur success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of service providers. We market and sell our platform and solutions through an all-channel assisted sales model and we derive substantially all of our revenue from these service providers. We generally enter into agreements with our service providers outlining the terms of our relationship, including service provider pricing commitments, installation, maintenance and support requirements, and our sales registration process for registering potential sales to subscribers. These contracts, including our contract with Monitronics International, Inc., typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year, and are terminable at the end of the initial term or renewal terms without cause upon written notice to the other party. In some cases, these contracts provide the service provider with the right to terminate prior to the expiration of the term without cause upon 30 days written notice, or, in the case of certain termination events, the right to terminate the contract immediately. While we have developed a network of over 5,000 service providers to sell, install and support our platform and solutions, we receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of channel partners. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our 10 largest revenue service providers accounted for approximately 63.4%, 64.7% and 65.7% of our revenue. Vivint represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2014 and 2013. Monitronics International, Inc. represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013. United Technologies Corporation represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2014.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of service providers for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future and, in some cases, a portion of our revenue attributable to individual service providers may increase in the future. The loss of one or more key service providers, a reduction in sales through any major service providers or the inability or unwillingness of any of our major service providers to pay for our platform and solutions would reduce our revenue and could impair our profitability.\nWe have relatively limited visibility regarding the consumers that ultimately purchase our solutions, and we often rely on information from third-party service providers to help us manage our business. If these service providers fail to provide timely or accurate information, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed.\nWe sell our solutions through service providers. These service providers work with consumers to design, install, update and maintain their connected home installations and manage the relationship with our subscribers. While we are able to track orders from service providers and have access to certain information about the configurations of their Alarm.com systems that we receive through our platform, we also rely on service providers to provide us with information about consumer behavior, product and system feedback, consumer demographics and buying patterns. We use this channel sell-through data, along with other metrics, to forecast our revenue, assess consumer demand for our solution, develop new solutions, adjust pricing and make other strategic business decisions. Channel sell-through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third-party nature of the data and thus may not be complete or accurate. If we do not receive consumer information on a timely or\naccurate basis, or if we do not properly interpret this information, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed.\nConsumers may choose to adopt point products that provide control of discrete home functions rather than adopting our connected home platform. If we are unable to increase market awareness of the benefits of our unified solutions, our revenue may not continue to grow, or it may decline.\nMany vendors have emerged, and may continue to emerge, to provide point products with advanced functionality for use in the home, such as a thermostat that can be controlled by an application on a smartphone. We expect more and more consumer electronic and consumer appliance products to be network-aware and connected - each very likely to have its own smart device (phone or tablet) application. Consumers may be attracted to the relatively low costs of these point products and the ability to expand their home control solution over time with minimal upfront costs, despite some of the disadvantages of this approach, may reduce demand for our connected home solutions. If so, our service providers may switch and offer the point products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. If a significant number of consumers in our target market choose to adopt point products rather than our connected home solutions, then our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve sustained growth or our business may decline.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and harm our results of operations.\nOur industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or be acquired. In addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our connected home solutions, and the lack of continued market acceptance of our connected home solutions would result in lower revenue.\nOur connected home solutions account for substantially all of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As a result, our revenue could be reduced by:\n\u2022\nany decline in demand for our connected home solutions;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our connected home solutions to achieve continued market acceptance;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our connected home solutions;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations or new communications standards that our connected home solutions does not address; and\n\u2022\nour inability to release enhanced versions of our connected home solutions on a timely basis.\nWe are vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for Internet-connected devices in general and interactive security systems in particular. If the market for connected home solutions grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for connected home solutions does not grow as quickly as anticipated, whether as a result of competition, product obsolescence, technological change, unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical environment, budgetary constraints of our consumers or other factors, we may not be able to continue to increase our revenue and earnings and our stock price would decline.\nA significant decline in our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe generally bill our service providers based on the number of subscribers they have on our platform and the features being utilized by subscribers on a monthly basis in advance. Subscribers could elect to terminate our services in any given month. If our efforts and our service providers\u2019 efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to retain them or sell additional functionality to them and, as a result, our revenue and ability to grow could be adversely affected. We track our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on an annualized basis, as reflected in the section of this Annual Report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - Key Metrics -SaaS and License Revenue Renewal Rate.\u201d However, our service providers, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five year service contracts with our subscribers. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base,\nincluding subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service providers. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict future trends in renewals and the resulting churn. Subscribers may choose not to renew their contracts for many reasons, including the belief that our service is not required for their needs or is otherwise not cost-effective, a desire to reduce discretionary spending, or a belief that our competitors\u2019 services provide better value. Additionally, our subscribers may not renew for reasons entirely out of our control, such as moving a residence or the dissolution of their business, which is particularly common for small to mid-sized businesses. A significant increase in our churn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf we are unable to develop new solutions, sell our platform and solutions into new markets or further penetrate our existing markets, our revenue may not grow as expected.\nOur ability to increase sales will depend, in large part, on our ability to enhance and improve our platform and solutions, introduce new solutions in a timely manner, sell into new markets and further penetrate our existing markets. The success of any enhancement or new solution or service depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of enhanced or new solutions, the ability to maintain and develop relationships with service providers, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel and the effectiveness of our marketing programs. Any new product or service we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. Any new markets into which we attempt to sell our platform and solutions, including new vertical markets and new countries or regions, may not be receptive. Our ability to further penetrate our existing markets depends on the quality of our platform and solutions and our ability to design our platform and solutions to meet consumer demand.\nWe benefit from integration of our solutions with third-party security platform providers. If these developers choose not to partner with us, or are acquired by our competitors, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur solutions are incorporated into the hardware of our third-party security platform providers. For example, our hardware platform partners produce control devices that deliver our platform services to subscribers. It may be necessary in the future to renegotiate agreements relating to various aspects of these solutions or other third parties. The inability to easily integrate with, or any defects in, any third-party solutions could result in increased costs, or in delays in new product releases or updates to our existing solutions until such issues have been resolved, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects and could damage our reputation. In addition, if these third-party solution providers choose not to partner with us, choose to integrate their solutions with our competitors\u2019 platforms, or are unable or unwilling to update their solutions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Further, if third-party solution providers that we partner with or that we would benefit from partnering with are acquired by our competitors, they may choose not to offer their solutions on our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on wireless carriers to provide access to wireless networks through which we provide our wireless alarm, notification and intelligent automation services, and any interruption of such access would impair our business.\nWe rely on wireless carriers to provide access to wireless networks for machine-to-machine data transmissions, which are an integral part of our services. Our wireless carriers may suspend wireless service to expand, maintain or improve their networks. Any suspension or other interruption of services would adversely affect our ability to provide our services to our service providers and subscribers and may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, the inability to maintain our existing contracts with our wireless carriers or enter into new contracts with such wireless carriers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to adapt to technological change, including maintaining compatibility with a wide range of devices, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired.\nThe market for connected home solutions is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new subscribers and increase revenue from existing subscribers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate changes in industry standards, to continue to enhance our existing solutions or introduce new solutions on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments, and to maintain compatibility with a wide range of connected devices in the home and business. We may change aspects of our operating system and may utilize open source technology in the future, which may cause difficulties including compatibility, stability and time to market. The success of this or any enhanced or new product or solution will depend on several factors, including the timely completion and market acceptance of the enhanced or new product or solution. Similarly, if any of our competitors implement new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective products than ours, possibly at lower prices. Any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced solutions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe technology we employ may become obsolete, and we may need to incur significant capital expenditures to update our technology.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological innovation. Our platform and solutions interact with the hardware and software technology of systems and devices located at our subscribers\u2019 properties. We may be required to implement new technologies or adapt existing technologies in response to changing market conditions, consumer preferences or industry standards, which could require significant capital expenditures. For example, many of our service providers are currently working to upgrade our solutions that were installed using 2G wireless technology, which could impact the delivery of our solutions for existing subscribers reliant upon 2G wireless technology. It is also possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant technical advantage that allows them to provide additional or superior quality products or services, or to lower their price for similar products or services, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our inability to adapt to changing technologies, market conditions or consumer preferences in a timely manner could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe depend on our suppliers, and the loss of any key supplier could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur hardware products depend on the quality of components that we procure from third-party suppliers. Reliance on suppliers, as well as industry supply conditions, generally involves several risks, including the possibility of defective parts, which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our platform and solutions, and a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery schedules and increases in component costs, which can adversely affect our profitability. We have several large hardware suppliers from which we procure hardware on a purchase order basis, including one supplier that supplied products and components in an amount equal to 37% of our hardware and other revenue in 2015. If these suppliers are unable to continue to provide a timely and reliable supply, we could experience interruptions in delivery of our platform and solutions to service providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were required to find alternative sources of supply, qualification of alternative suppliers and the establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on market awareness and a strong brand, and any failure to develop, maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or attract subscribers.\nWe believe that building and maintaining market awareness, brand recognition and goodwill in a cost-effective manner is critical to our overall success in achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions and is an important element in attracting new service providers and subscribers. An important part of our business strategy is to increase service provider and consumer awareness of our brand and to provide marketing leadership, services and support to our service provider network. This will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality solutions, and we may not be able to do so effectively. While we may choose to engage in a broader marketing campaign to further promote our brand, this effort may not be successful. Our efforts in developing our brand may be hindered by the marketing efforts of our competitors and our reliance on our service providers and strategic partners to promote our brand. If we are unable to cost-effectively maintain and increase awareness of our brand, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe operate in the emerging and evolving connected home market, which may develop more slowly or differently than we expect. If the connected home market does not grow as we expect, or if we cannot expand our platform and solutions to meet the demands of this market, our revenue may decline, fail to grow or fail to grow at an accelerated rate, and we may incur additional operating losses.\nThe market for solutions that bring objects and systems not typically connected to the Internet, such as home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management solutions, into an Internet-like structure is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether, how rapidly or how consistently this market will develop, and even if it does develop, whether our platform and solutions will be accepted into the markets in which we operate. Some consumers may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platform and solutions for a number of reasons, including satisfaction with traditional solutions, concerns about additional costs and lack of awareness of the benefits of our platform and solutions. Our ability to expand the sales of our platform and solutions into new markets depends on several factors, including the awareness of our platform and solutions, the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of our platform and solutions, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel, the ability to develop relationships with service providers, the effectiveness of our marketing programs, the costs of our platform and solutions and the success of our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in developing and marketing our platform and solutions into new markets, or if consumers do not perceive or value the benefits of our platform and solutions, the market for our platform and solutions might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would harm our revenue and growth prospects.\nRisks of liability from our operations are significant.\nThe nature of the solutions we provide, including our interactive security solutions, potentially exposes us to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure than may be inherent in other businesses. Substantially all of our service provider agreements contain provisions limiting our liability to service providers and our subscribers in an attempt to reduce this risk. However, in the event of litigation with respect to these matters, we cannot assure you that these limitations will be enforced, and the costs of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured for these risks. Certain of our insurance policies and the laws of some states may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages or liability arising from gross negligence.\nFailure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including information relating to our service providers, subscribers and employees, could adversely affect us.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and, in the normal course of our business, we collect and retain certain information pertaining to our service providers, subscribers and employees, including credit card information for many of our service providers and certain of our subscribers. If security breaches in connection with the delivery of our solutions allow unauthorized third parties to access any of this data or obtain control of our subscribers\u2019 systems, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security, privacy and credit card fraud is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of service provider, subscriber, employee or other personally identifiable data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in loss of confidential information, damage to our reputation, early termination of our service provider contracts, significant costs, fines, litigation, regulatory investigations or actions and other liabilities or actions against us. Moreover, to the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft, we may experience a general decline in consumer confidence in our business, which may lead to an increase in attrition rates or may make it more difficult to attract new subscribers. Such an event could additionally result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market's perception of the security and reliability of our services. Security breaches of, or sustained attacks against, this infrastructure could create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot be certain that advances in cyber-capabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our platform and solutions. If any one of these risks materializes our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur strategy includes pursuing acquisitions, and our potential inability to successfully integrate newly-acquired technologies, assets or businesses may harm our financial results. Future acquisitions of technologies, assets or businesses, which are paid for partially or entirely through the issuance of stock or stock rights, could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.\nWe have acquired businesses in the past. For example, we acquired EnergyHub, Inc. in 2013 and we acquired the assets of Horizon Analog, Inc. and Secure-i, Inc., respectively, in December 2014, and of HiValley Technology Inc. in March 2015. We also believe part of our growth will be driven by acquisitions of other companies or their technologies, assets and businesses. Any acquisitions we complete will give rise to risks, including:\n\u2022\nincurring higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n\u2022\nfailing to assimilate the operations and personnel or failing to retain the key personnel of the acquired company or business;\n\u2022\nfailing to integrate the acquired technologies, or incurring significant expense to integrate acquired technologies into our platform and solutions;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndiverting our management\u2019s attention and other company resources;\n\u2022\nfailing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;\n\u2022\nincurring significant accounting charges;\n\u2022\nimpairing relationships with employees, service providers or subscribers;\n\u2022\nfinding that the acquired technology, asset or business does not further our business strategy, that we overpaid for the technology, asset or business or that we may be required to write off acquired assets or investments partially or entirely;\n\u2022\nfailing to realize the expected synergies of the transaction;\n\u2022\nbeing exposed to unforeseen liabilities and contingencies that were not identified prior to acquiring the company; and\n\u2022\nbeing unable to generate sufficient revenue and profits from acquisitions to offset the associated acquisition costs.\nFully integrating an acquired technology, asset or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any such acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital requirements, or could cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to engage in strategic transactions and these expenditures may not result in successful acquisitions.\nWe expect that the consideration we might pay for any future acquisitions of technologies, assets or businesses could include stock, rights to purchase stock, cash or some combination of the foregoing. If we issue stock or rights to purchase stock in connection with future acquisitions, net income per share and then-existing holders of our common stock may experience dilution.\nWe may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our current business model, which may cause our business to suffer.\nWe may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our current business model, including expanding our platform and solutions and investing in new and unproven technologies. For example, in 2013, we entered the energy management market through our acquisition of EnergyHub. We can offer no assurance that any such new business opportunities will prove to be successful. Among other negative effects, our pursuit of such business opportunities could reduce operating margins and require more working capital, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEvolving government and industry regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet and data privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, federal, state or foreign agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy and content. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS business model. In addition, taxation of products or services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.\nOur platform and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to our subscribers\u2019 interactive security, intelligent automation, video monitoring and energy management systems. A valuable component of our platform and solutions is our ability to analyze this data to present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our service providers, our subscribers and third-party providers. We cannot assure you that the data we require for our proprietary data sets will be available from these sources in the future or that the cost of such data will not increase. The United States federal government and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, storage and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that is more rigorous governing data collection and storage than in the United States. On October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling that calls into question the continued availability of all provisions of the United States-European Union Safe Harbor Framework, a privacy protection mechanism that facilitated the transfer of personal data to the United States in compliance with the European Commission\u2019s Directive on Data Protection, and there is significant regulatory uncertainty surrounding the future of data transfers from the European Union to the United States. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply, or are perceived to fail to comply, with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. Further, in the event of a breach of personal information that we hold, we may be subject to governmental fines, individual claims, remediation expenses, and/or harm to our reputation. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our ability to use and share this data or our ability to store, process and share data over the Internet, demand for our platform and solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nAlthough we are not currently subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, which regulates the use, storage, and disclosure of personally identifiable health information, we may modify our platform and solutions to become HIPAA compliant. Becoming fully HIPAA compliant involves adopting and implementing privacy and security policies and procedures as well as administrative, physical and technical safeguards. Additionally, HIPAA compliance requires certain agreements with contracting partners to be in place and the appointment of a Privacy and Security Officer. Endeavoring to become HIPAA compliant may be costly both financially and in terms of administrative resources. It may take substantial time and require the assistance of external resources, such as attorneys, information technology, and/or other consultants. We would have to be HIPAA compliant to provide services for or on behalf of a health care provider or health plan pursuant to which patient information was exchanged. Thus, if we do not become fully HIPAA compliant, our expansion opportunities may be limited. Furthermore, it is possible that HIPAA may be expanded in the future to apply to certain of our platform and/or solutions as currently constituted.\nWe rely on the performance of our senior management and highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of senior management and key personnel, including Stephen Trundle, our Chief Executive Officer, and our senior information technology managers. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key personnel could interrupt our ability to execute our business plan, as such individuals may be difficult to replace. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe provide minimum service level commitments to certain of our service providers, and our failure to meet them could cause us to issue credits for future services or pay penalties, which could harm our results of operations.\nCertain of our service provider agreements currently, and may in the future, provide minimum service level commitments regarding items such as uptime, functionality or performance. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments for these service providers or suffer extended periods of service unavailability, we are or may be contractually obligated to provide these service providers with credits for future services, provide services at no cost or pay other penalties, which could adversely impact our revenue. We do not currently have any reserves on our balance sheet for these commitments.\nWe have already incurred and expect to incur a material amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial health.\nWe are party to a senior line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and a syndicate of lenders, which we refer to as our 2014 Facility, that allows us to draw down an aggregate amount equal to $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had an outstanding balance of $6.7 million under our 2014 Facility. This indebtedness and certain covenants and obligations contained in the related documentation could adversely affect our financial health and business and future operations by, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate.\nFurthermore, substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, secure our 2014 Facility. If an event of default under the credit agreement occurs and is continuing, SVB may request the acceleration of the related indebtedness and foreclose on the security interests.\nIn addition, our 2014 Facility restricts our ability to make dividend payments and requires us to maintain a certain leverage ratio, which may restrict our ability to invest in future growth. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nIn the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. In the future, we may not be able to timely secure debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other\nsecurities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, including shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $31.0 million of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. We review such assets for impairment at least annually. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the solutions we offer, challenges to the validity of certain registered intellectual property, reduced sales of certain products or services incorporating registered intellectual property, increased attrition and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations. Depending on future circumstances, it is possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Any future determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would harm our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income, sales, use, value added and other taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct business, which laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales, use, value added or other taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. These determinations are highly complex and require detailed analysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be different from our historical tax practices, provisions and accruals. If we receive an adverse ruling as a result of an audit, or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the tax regulations to which we are subject, our tax provision, results of operations or cash flows could be harmed. In addition, liabilities associated with taxes are often subject to an extended or indefinite statute of limitations period. Therefore, we may be subject to additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) for a particular year for extended periods of time.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism or global or regional economic, political and social conditions.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, or a significant power outage could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Natural disasters could affect our hardware vendors, our wireless carriers or our network operations centers. Further, if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue, such as metropolitan areas in North America, consumers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our platform and solutions from service providers in the region, which may harm our results of operations for a particular period. In addition, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our hardware vendors, service providers, subscribers or the economy as a whole. More generally, these geopolitical, social and economic conditions could result in increased volatility in worldwide financial markets and economies that could harm our sales. Given our concentration of sales during the second and third quarters, any disruption in the business of our hardware vendors, service providers or subscribers that impacts sales during the second or third quarter of each year could have a greater impact on our annual results. All of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if the disaster recovery plans for us, our service providers and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of orders, or delays in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our platform and solutions, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nDownturns in general economic and market conditions and reductions in spending may reduce demand for our platform and solutions, which could harm our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revenue, results of operations and cash flows depend on the overall demand for our platform and solutions. Concerns about the systemic impact of a potential widespread recession, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility, decreased consumer confidence and diminished growth expectations in the U.S. economy and abroad. The current unstable general economic and market conditions have been characterized by a dramatic decline in consumer discretionary spending and have disproportionately affected providers of solutions that represent discretionary purchases. While the decline in consumer spending has recently moderated, these economic conditions could still lead to continued declines in consumer spending over the foreseeable future, and may have resulted in a resetting of consumer spending habits that may make it unlikely that such spending will return to prior levels for the foreseeable future.\nDuring weak economic times, the available pool of service providers may decline as the prospects for home building and home renovation projects diminish, which may have a corresponding impact on our growth prospects. In addition, there is an increased risk during these periods that an increased percentage of our service providers will file for bankruptcy protection, which may harm our reputation, revenue, profitability and results of operations. In addition, we may determine that the cost of pursuing any claim may outweigh the recovery potential of such claim. Likewise, consumer bankruptcies can detrimentally affect the business stability of our service providers. Prolonged economic slowdowns and reductions in new home construction and renovation projects may result in diminished sales of our platform and solutions. Further worsening, broadening or protracted extension of the economic downturn could have a negative impact on our business, revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe conduct our business in the United States and are expanding internationally in various other countries. We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. Travel Act, and possibly other anti-bribery laws, including those that comply with the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and other international conventions. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit our company from authorizing, offering, or providing directly or indirectly improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private-sector. Certain laws could also prohibit us from soliciting or accepting bribes or kickbacks. Our company has direct government interactions and in several cases uses third-party representatives, including dealers, for regulatory compliance, sales and other purposes in a variety of countries. These factors increase our anti-corruption risk profile. We can be held liable for the corrupt activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents will comply with these laws and policies.\nWe are also subject to data privacy and security laws, anti-money laundering laws (such as the USA PATRIOT Act), and import/export laws and regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions.\nOur global operations require us to import from and export to several countries, which geographically stretches our compliance obligations. Our platform and solutions are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our platform and solutions must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if our service providers fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in our platform or solutions or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our platform and solutions in international markets, prevent our service providers with international operations from deploying our platform and solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform and solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws and regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such laws and regulations, could also result in decreased use of our platform and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform and solutions to existing or potential service providers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform and solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform and solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our software contains encryption technologies, certain types of which are subject to U.S. and foreign export control regulations and, in some foreign countries, restrictions on importation and/or use. Any failure on our part to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements could result in financial penalties or other sanctions under the U.S. export regulations, including restrictions on future export activities, which could harm our business and operating results. Regulatory restrictions could impair our access to technologies needed to improve our platform and solutions and may also limit or reduce the demand for our platform and solutions outside of the United States.\nFurthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions programs prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons that are subject to U.S. economic embargoes and trade sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our platform and solutions from being shipped or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our platform and solutions could be shipped to those targets or provided by third-parties despite such precautions. Any such shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Furthermore, any new embargo or sanctions program, or any change in the countries, governments, persons or activities targeted by such programs,\ncould result in decreased use of our platform and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform and solutions to existing or potential service providers, which would likely adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nChanges in laws that apply to us could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In certain jurisdictions, regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain governments or other customers, the loss of export privileges, multi-jurisdictional liability, reputational harm, and other collateral consequences. If any governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings as to which we are unable to assess our exposure and which could become significant liabilities in the event of an adverse judgment.\nWe are involved and have been involved in the past in legal proceedings from time to time. For example, on June 2, 2015, Vivint filed a lawsuit against us alleging that our technology directly and indirectly infringes six patents owned by Vivint. See the section of this Annual Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information on this matter. Companies in our industry have been subject to claims related to patent infringement and product liability, as well as contract and employment-related claims. We may not be able to accurately assess the risks related to these suits, and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure. As a result of these proceedings, we have, and may be required to seek in the future, licenses under patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties, including open-source software and other commercially available software, which can be costly. For example, we have initiated and been involved with intellectual property litigation as a result of which we have entered into cross-license agreements relating to our and third-party intellectual property, and in one such case we initiated in 2013 and settled in January 2014, we incurred $11.2 million of legal expense in 2013.\nOur business operates in a regulated industry.\nOur business, operations and service providers are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local consumer protection laws, licensing regulation and other laws and regulations, and, to a lesser extent, similar Canadian laws and regulations. Our advertising and sales practices and that of our service provider network are subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, in addition to state consumer protection laws. The FTC and the Federal Communications Commission have issued regulations that place restrictions on, among other things, unsolicited automated telephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems and the use of prerecorded or artificial voice messages. If our service providers were to take actions in violation of these regulations, such as telemarketing to individuals on the \u201cDo Not Call\u201d registry, we could be subject to fines, penalties, private actions or enforcement actions by government regulators. Although we have taken steps to insulate ourselves from any such wrongful conduct by our service providers, and to require our service providers to comply with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to liability as result of our service providers\u2019 conduct. Further, to the extent that any changes in law or regulation further restrict the lead generation activity of our service providers, these restrictions could result in a material reduction in subscriber acquisition opportunities, reducing the growth prospects of our business and adversely affecting our financial condition and future cash flows. In addition, most states in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the monitored security services industry. Our business relies heavily upon cellular telephone service to communicate signals. Cellular telephone companies are currently regulated by both federal and state governments. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any such applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses, including in geographic areas where our services have substantial penetration, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, if these laws and regulations were to change or if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations as they exist today or in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the U.S. insurance industry were to change its practice of providing incentives to homeowners for the use of alarm monitoring services, we could experience a reduction in new subscriber growth or an increase in our subscriber attrition rate.\nIt has been common practice in the U.S. insurance industry to provide a reduction in rates for policies written on homes that have monitored alarm systems. There can be no assurance that insurance companies will continue to offer these rate reductions. If these incentives were reduced or eliminated, new homeowners who otherwise may not feel the need for alarm monitoring services would be removed from our potential subscriber pool, which could hinder the growth of our business, and existing subscribers may choose to disconnect or not renew their service contracts, which could increase our attrition rates. In either case, our results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe face many risks associated with our plans to expand internationally, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe anticipate that our efforts to expand internationally will entail the marketing and advertising of our platform, solutions and brand. While our platform and solutions are designed for ease of localization, revenue in countries outside of the United States and Canada accounted for less than 1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. We also do not have substantial experience in selling our platform and solutions in international markets outside of the United States and Canada or in conforming to the local cultures, standards, or policies necessary to successfully compete in those markets, and we may be required to invest significant resources in order to do so. We may not succeed in these efforts or achieve our consumer acquisition, service provider expansion or other goals. In some international markets, consumer preferences and buying behaviors may be different, and we may use business or pricing models that are different from our traditional model to provide our platform and solutions to consumers in those markets or we may be unsuccessful in implementing the appropriate business model. Our revenue from new foreign markets may not exceed the costs of establishing, marketing, and maintaining our international offerings. In addition, the current instability in the eurozone could have many adverse consequences on our international expansion, including sovereign default, liquidity and capital pressures on eurozone financial institutions, reducing the availability of credit and increasing the risk of financial sector failures and the risk of one or more eurozone member states leaving the euro, resulting in the possibility of capital and exchange controls and uncertainty about the impact of contracts and currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, conducting expanded international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in our current markets. These risks include:\n\u2022\nlocalization of our solutions, including the addition of foreign languages and adaptation to new local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlack of experience in other geographic markets;\n\u2022\nstrong local competitors;\n\u2022\nthe cost and burden of complying with, lack of familiarity with, and unexpected changes in, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including more stringent privacy regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates or restrictions on foreign currency;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of transfer pricing, value added or other tax systems, double taxation and restrictions and/or taxes on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ndependence on third parties, including commercial partners with whom we do not have extensive experience;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general; and\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nOperating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nOur software contains encryption technologies, certain types of which are subject to U.S. and foreign export control regulations and, in some foreign countries, restrictions on importation and/or use. Any failure on our part to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements could result in financial penalties or other sanctions under the U.S. export regulations, including restrictions on future export activities, which could harm our business and operating results. Regulatory restrictions could impair our access to technologies needed to improve our platform and solutions and may also limit or reduce the demand for our platform and solutions outside of the United States.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our proprietary technology is essential to establishing and maintaining our leadership position. We seek to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements, patents, trademarks, domain names and other measures, some of which afford only limited protection. We also rely on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology, or design around our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. Our failure or inability to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo prevent substantial unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement and/or misappropriation of our proprietary rights against third parties. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management's attention, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nAn assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses that could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been involved with patent litigation suits in the past and we may be involved with and subject to similar litigation in the future to defend our intellectual property position. For example, on June 2, 2015, Vivint filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Utah, alleging that our technology directly and indirectly infringes six patents that Vivint purchased. Vivint is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorney\u2019s fees. We answered the complaint on July 23, 2015. Among other things, we asserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents in question. Should Vivint prevail on its claims that one or more elements of our solution infringe one or more of its patents, we could be required to pay damages of Vivint\u2019s lost profits and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, enjoined from making, using, and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us or we are unable to design around such patents, and required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to Vivint\u2019s claims, any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we were to prevail, this litigation could be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from purchasing our solution, which would also materially harm our business. During the course of litigation, we anticipate announcements of the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments related to the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation and our service provider contracts may require us to indemnify them against certain liabilities they may incur as a result of our infringement of any third party intellectual property. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. For example, in 2013, we incurred $11.2 million in legal fees associated with intellectual property litigation that we asserted against a third party and the related counterclaims and in 2014, we incurred $1.4 million of costs related to intellectual property claims. In addition, we currently have a limited portfolio of issued patents compared to our larger competitors, and therefore may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant products or revenues and against which our potential patents provide no deterrence, and many other potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Given that our platform and solutions integrate with all aspects of the home, the risk that our platform and solutions may be subject to these allegations is exacerbated. As we seek to extend our platform and solutions, we could be constrained by the intellectual property rights of others. If our platform and solutions exceed the scope of in-bound licenses or violate any third-party proprietary rights, we could be required to withdraw those solutions from the market, re-develop those solutions or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any efforts to re-develop our platform and solutions, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were compelled to withdraw any of our platform and solutions from the market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service providers for certain expenses and liabilities resulting from intellectual property infringement claims regarding our platform and solutions, which could force us to incur substantial costs.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service providers for intellectual property infringement claims regarding our platform and solutions. As a result, in the case of infringement claims against these service providers, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund amounts they have paid to us. We expect that some of our service providers may seek indemnification from us in connection with infringement claims brought against them. In addition, we may elect to indemnify service providers where we have no contractual obligation to indemnify them and we will evaluate each such request on a case-by-case basis. If a service provider elects to invest resources in enforcing a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face substantial liability.\nThe use of open source software in our platform and solutions may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nSome of our platform and solutions use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user's software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user's software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on potentially unfavorable terms or at no cost.\nThe terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and accordingly there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our platform and solutions. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platform and solutions, to re-develop our platform and solutions, to discontinue sales of our platform and solutions or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could harm our business. Further, given the nature of open source software, it may be more likely that third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of these open source software programs. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions.\nAlthough we are not aware of any use of open source software in our platform and solutions that would require us to disclose all or a portion of the source code underlying our core solutions, it is possible that such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying our platform and solutions. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our platform and solutions without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our platform and solutions. This could harm our intellectual property position as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained.\nPrior to our recently completed initial public offering, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our shares will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell the shares at all.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are related in complex ways. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in June 2015 at a price of $14.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from an intraday low of $10.26 to an intraday high of $20.25 through December 31, 2015. Factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nvariance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the prices of our platform and solutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in our projected operating and financial results;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our platform and solutions or marketing techniques;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions or new solutions;\n\u2022\nour involvement in any litigation;\n\u2022\nour sale of our common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, regulatory and market conditions.\nRecently, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act. For as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and non-binding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As we have elected to take advantage of the exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our auditors will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors may become less comfortable with the effectiveness of our internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal controls go undetected may increase. As we intend to provide reduced disclosures in our periodic reports and proxy statements regarding executive compensation while we are an emerging growth company, investors will have access to less information and analysis about our executive compensation, which may make it difficult for investors to evaluate our executive compensation practices. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions and provide reduced disclosure. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be harmed. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue; the date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain a system of effective internal controls over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may harm investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the 2016 annual report we file with the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission, or the SEC. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. However, our auditors are not required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act.\nWe are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. As we continue to transition to the requirements of reporting as a public company, we may need to add additional finance staff. We may not be able to remediate any future material weaknesses, or to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls when they are required to issue such opinion, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could harm our stock price.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have incurred and we will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nWe completed our initial public offering on July 1, 2015. As a new public company, we have incurred and we will continue to incur increased legal, accounting and other costs not incurred as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations of the SEC regulate the corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect that compliance with these requirements will continue to increase certain of our expenses and make some activities more time-consuming than they have been in the past when we were a private company. Such additional costs going forward could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nOur future depends in part on the interests and influence of key stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, all of whom are represented on our board of directors, together with their affiliates beneficially own 78.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. This ownership could affect the value of your shares of common stock by, for example, these stockholders electing to delay, defer or prevent a change in corporate control, merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock, without further stockholder action and with voting liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent, and limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for director nominees;\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with directors in each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors and the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent or call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the vote of a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. As of December 31, 2015, 45,581,662 shares of our common stock were issued and 45,485,294 shares of our common stock were outstanding. The majority of these shares were acquired prior to our initial public offering and were subject to lock-up agreements prohibiting holders of these shares from selling any of their shares for a period of 180 days following our initial public offering. These lock-up agreements have expired and, as a result, a substantial number of our shares are now generally freely tradable, subject, in the case of sales by our affiliates, to the volume limitations and other provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If holders of these shares sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Furthermore, shares of our common stock subject to outstanding awards under our Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, as well as the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and upon exercise of outstanding warrants, will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially.", "PERMNO": 15409, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ALRM"}
