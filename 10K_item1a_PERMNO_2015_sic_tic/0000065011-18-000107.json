{"cik": "65011", "company": "MEREDITH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-09-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, investors should consider carefully the following risk factors when investing in our securities. In addition to the risks described below, there may be additional risks that we have not yet perceived or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nRisks Relating to the Acquisition of Time\nThe Company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Time, those benefits may take longer to realize than expected, or the Company may encounter significant difficulties in integrating Time\u2019s business into our operations. If the acquisition does not achieve its intended cost savings results, the business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Although the Company currently estimates annual cost synergies in excess of $500 million within the first two full years of\ncombined operation and incurring costs to achieve those synergies of approximately $300 million spread evenly between the first two years of operation, actual synergies and cost savings could differ materially from our current expectations. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition of Time, including anticipated synergies, will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Time\u2019s business into our existing operations. In addition, these synergies and cost savings are based on estimates and assumptions made that are inherently uncertain, and are subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.\nThe combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process that will require significant management attention and resources. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would limit the expected benefits to us. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the Company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the Company.\nIn addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\nconforming standards, controls, procedures, accounting and other policies, business cultures, and\ncompensation structures between the two companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate cultures; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of these factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and additional diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations are integrated successfully, the full benefits, including the synergies, cost savings, revenue growth, or other benefits that are expected, may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, and negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that the acquisition of Time will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate.\nThe successful execution of the post-acquisition integration strategy will involve considerable risks and may not be successful. If management is unable to minimize the potential disruption of the ongoing business and distraction of management during the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized or realized as quickly as we anticipate. Realizing the benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the integration of technology, operations, and personnel while maintaining adequate focus on core businesses. There may be overlaps in the current offerings of us and Time, which could negate some of the anticipated benefits and enhanced revenue opportunities resulting from the acquisition. There are no assurances that any cost savings, greater economies of scale, and other operational efficiencies, as well as revenue enhancement opportunities anticipated from the combination of the two businesses will occur. Operating expenses may increase significantly in the near term due to the increased headcount, expanded operations, and expense or changes related to post-acquisition integration. To the extent that the Company\u2019s expenses increase but its revenues do not, there are unanticipated expenses related to the integration process, or there are significant costs associated with presently unknown liabilities, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, failure to minimize the numerous risks associated with the post-acquisition integration strategy also may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nSignificant costs associated with the acquisition will be incurred. We have incurred and will incur substantial expenses as a result of the acquisition of Time including expenses in connection with coordinating the businesses, operations, policies, and procedures. These expenses include expenses we will incur in connection with achieving synergies, and expenses associated with the new indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition. While we have assumed that a certain level of integration expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately.\nEmployee uncertainty related to the acquisition could harm the Company. Employees may experience uncertainty about their future role with the Company until or after strategies are executed. The integration team that is working on effectively combining the companies\u2019 businesses may streamline operations to achieve cost savings or in response to general economic conditions. The integration process may cause disruptions among employees or erode employee morale. Employee uncertainty may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract new personnel to fill key positions that may become available upon integration of the two businesses or to retain current employees necessary to implement the Company\u2019s strategies, either of which may disrupt the operations of the Company. We may not succeed in retaining current employees. Management may not be successful in motivating continuing employees and keeping them focused on the strategies and goals of the Company during potential workforce reductions and other distractions relating to the acquisition.\nCustomers may delay or cancel business arrangements, or seek to modify existing relationships, as a result of concerns over the acquisition or to extract negotiation leverage. The acquisition could cause potential customers to delay or cancel contracts as a result of concerns over the acquisition. In particular, prospective customers could be reluctant to purchase the Company\u2019s products and services due to uncertainty about the direction of the Company. Moreover, existing customers may seek to modify their relationships to extract leverage in connection with current or anticipated contract negotiations. A delay or cancellation of purchases by potential customers or modification of current arrangements by existing customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of Time that could become impaired, resulting in significant non-cash charges against earnings. In connection with the accounting for the acquisition of Time, we recorded a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), the Company must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets has been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the proposed divestiture of our non-core media assets. As previously disclosed, we anticipate agreements to sell the TIME, Sports Illustrated, Fortune, and Money brands, along with our 60 percent equity investment in Viant, to be finalized in early fiscal 2019. These brands and businesses have different target audiences and advertising bases than the rest of our portfolio, and we believe each is better suited for success with a new owner. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; the disruption of our day-to-day operations; and the potential loss of key employees. We may not receive an acceptable offer for our non-core media assets and we may not be able to negotiate an acceptable definitive agreement or consummate a sale transaction in a timely manner or at all. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through transition service agreements, guarantees, and indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations and liabilities, which could adversely affect our future financial results. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting our non-core media assets.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness and Equity\nOur substantial level of indebtedness and our ability to incur significant additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, and\nother general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness,\nthereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other\ngeneral corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in interest rates, to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a potential disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\naffect our credit ratings; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pay dividends.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on and be subject to our future financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. Our business may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or we may be unable to efficiently repatriate the portion of our cash flow that is derived from our foreign operations or borrow funds in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments on our debt, to refinance our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we were unable to make payments on or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as asset sales, equity issuances, or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. The terms of our debt agreements and market or business conditions may limit our ability to take some or all of these actions. In addition, if we incur additional debt, the related risks described above could be exacerbated.\nOur indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly or could prevent us from taking advantage of lower rates. A portion of our indebtedness consists of term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings with variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable-rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. Even if we enter into interest rate swaps in the future in order to reduce future interest rate volatility, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable-rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. In addition, we have significant fixed-rate indebtedness that includes prepayment penalties which could prevent us from taking advantage of any future decrease in interest rates that may otherwise be applicable to us.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. Our ability to generate such cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, issuing equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments. These actions, if necessary, may not be affected on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at the applicable time. Any refinancing of our debt, if we are able to refinance our debt at all, could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Further, our credit agreements restrict our ability to undertake, or use the proceeds from, such measures. Our ability to repay our indebtedness is largely dependent on the generation of cash flow by our operating subsidiaries and our operating subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make cash available to us by dividend, intercompany loans, advances and other transactions, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, transfer cash to us to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nCovenants under the indenture governing our 2026 Senior Notes and our credit agreement may restrict our business and operations in many ways, and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. The indenture governing our $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.875 percent unsecured senior notes (2026 Senior Notes) and our credit agreement impose various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt, and make certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprovide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022\nincur liens on assets;\n\u2022\nengage in certain asset sales, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ndesignate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nprohibit certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nThese covenants may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the limitations and decreased flexibility on our business due to our significant debt obligations, we may not be able to capitalize on strategic opportunities or grow our business to the extent we would be able to without these limitations.\nOur failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement or the indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes, which could permit the administrative agent or the trustee, as applicable, or permit the lenders or the holders of the 2026 Senior Notes to cause the administrative agent or the trustee, as applicable, to declare all or part of any of our outstanding senior secured term loans or revolving loans or the 2026 Senior Notes to be immediately due and payable or to exercise any remedies provided to the administrative agent or the trustee, including, in the case of the credit agreement, proceeding against the collateral granted to secure our obligations under the credit agreement. An event of default under the credit agreement or the indenture governing\nthe 2026 Senior Notes could also lead to an event of default under the terms of certain of our other agreements. Any such event of default or any exercise of rights and remedies by our creditors could seriously harm our business.\nThe holder of our Series A preferred stock has rights that are senior to those of Meredith\u2019s common stockholders, and the terms of the Series A preferred stock may limit our ability to pay dividends. The Series A preferred stock ranks senior to any other class or series of equity, including Meredith\u2019s common stock and class B stock, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation. Meredith is required to pay dividends on the Series A preferred stock in cash or in kind at an annual rate. Meredith expects to continue to pay dividends on Meredith\u2019s common stock and class B stock, but for so long as the Series A preferred stock remains outstanding, Meredith\u2019s ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on, or purchase or redeem, shares of Meredith\u2019s common stock and class B stock is subject to compliance with certain covenants. Meredith\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of the Series A preferred stock could restrict Meredith\u2019s ability to pay dividends as expected.\nRisks Relating to Income Taxes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act) could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. The Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, includes numerous provisions that will affect businesses and may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. Among other things, the Tax Reform Act includes limitations on a corporation\u2019s ability to deduct certain expenses. Specifically, beginning after December 31, 2017, the deduction of net interest expenses for any taxable year of a corporate borrower will generally be capped at 30 percent of the \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d of such corporate borrower for such taxable year. For purposes of the foregoing provision, the term \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d generally refers to a corporation\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, and, in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, depreciation, amortization, and depletion. By contrast, prior to the adoption of the Tax Reform Act, interest paid or accrued by a business was generally deductible in the computation of taxable income subject to certain limitations. Accordingly, to the extent that the Tax Reform Act limits the amount of the Company\u2019s net interest expenses that is permitted to be deducted from the Company\u2019s taxable income in a taxable year, the Company will pay federal income taxes on more taxable income with respect to such taxable year, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition, including, among other things, its liquidity and its cost of capital. However, the Tax Reform Act\u2019s reduction of the corporate tax rate may mitigate the effect of this new limitation on the deductibility of net interest expenses.\nThe Time business could have an indemnification obligation to Time Warner, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition. The complete legal and structural separation of Time Warner Inc.\u2019s (Time Warner) magazine publishing and related business from Time Warner (the Spin-Off) was completed by way of a pro rata dividend of Time Inc. shares held by Time Warner to its stockholders as of May 23, 2014, based on a distribution ratio of one share of Time Inc. common stock for every eight shares of Time Warner common stock held (the Distribution). If, due to any of Time\u2019s representations being untrue or Time\u2019s covenants being breached, it was determined that the Distribution did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), or that an excess loss account existed at the date of the Spin-Off, Time could be required to indemnify Time Warner for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Business Operations\nAdvertising represents the largest portion of our revenues and advertising demand may fluctuate from period to period. In fiscal 2018, 50 percent of our revenues were derived from advertising. Advertising constitutes 48 percent of our national media revenues and 54 percent of our local media revenues. Demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the U.S. economy. During an economic downturn, demand for advertising may decrease. The growth in alternative forms of media, particularly electronic media including those based on the internet, has increased the competition for advertising dollars, which could in turn reduce expenditures for magazine and television advertising or suppress advertising rates.\nCirculation revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues. Magazine circulation is another significant source of revenue, representing 22 percent of total revenues and 31 percent of national media revenues. Preserving the number of copies sold is critical for maintaining advertising sales. Magazines face increasing competition from alternative forms of media and entertainment. As a result, sales of magazines through subscriptions and at the newsstand could decline. As publishers compete for subscribers, subscription prices could decrease and marketing expenditures may increase.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of alternative methods for the delivery of content and have driven consumer demand and expectations in unanticipated directions. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business, financial condition, and prospects may be adversely affected. Technology developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control, and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites proliferates. In addition, technologies such as subscription streaming media services and mobile video are increasing competition for household audiences and advertisers. This competition may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our broadcasting and print revenues, which we believe may challenge us to expand the contribution of our digital businesses.\nOur websites and internal networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized persons accessing our systems, which could disrupt our operations. The Company uses computers and other technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such increases expose us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our website activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, which we strive to protect from unauthorized access. However, it is possible that unauthorized persons may be able to circumvent our protections and misappropriate proprietary information, corrupt data, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our digital operations. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, public disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences, and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber-attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing. A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.\nEvolving privacy and information security laws and regulations may impair our ability to market to consumers. Meredith\u2019s consumer database includes first-party data that is used to market our products to our customers and is also rented to or used on behalf of marketing and advertising clients. As public awareness shifts to data gathering and usage, privacy rights, and data protection, new laws and regulations may be passed that would restrict or prevent us from utilizing this data. Such restrictions could reduce or eliminate this resource for generating revenue for the Company.\nWorld events may result in unexpected adverse operating results for our local media segment. Our local media results could be affected adversely by world events such as wars, political unrest, acts of terrorism, and natural disasters. Such events can result in significant declines in advertising revenues as the stations will not broadcast or will limit broadcasting of commercials during times of crisis. In addition, our stations may have higher newsgathering costs related to coverage of the events.\nOur local media operations are subject to FCC regulation. Our broadcasting stations operate under licenses granted by the FCC. The FCC regulates many aspects of television station operations including employment practices, political advertising, indecency and obscenity, programming, signal carriage, and various other technical matters. Violations of these regulations could result in penalties and fines. Changes in these regulations could impact the results of our operations. The FCC also regulates the ownership of television stations. Changes in the\nownership rules could adversely affect our ability to consummate future transactions or may favor our competitors. Details regarding regulation and its impact on our local media operations are provided in Item 1 - Business beginning on page 9.\nLoss of or changes in affiliation agreements could adversely affect operating results for our local media segment. Due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of our stations have network affiliation agreements. Seven are affiliated with CBS, five with FOX, two with MyNetworkTV, one with NBC, and one with ABC. These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations\u2019 commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming. We also make cash payments to the networks. These payments are in essence a portion of the retransmission consent fees that Meredith receives from cable, satellite, and telecommunications service providers, which pay Meredith to carry our television programming in our markets. These network relationships may also include terms regarding over-the-top distribution. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. Furthermore, the non-renewal of any retransmission consent agreement with a major cable, satellite, or telecommunications service provider could adversely affect the economics of our relationship with the applicable network(s), advertising revenues, and our local brands. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements and our retransmission agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. Our CBS affiliation agreements expire in June and August 2020. The MyNetworkTV affiliation agreements expire in September 2020. Our FOX affiliation agreements expire in December 2018. Our NBC affiliation agreement expires in December 2021 and our ABC affiliation agreement expires in December 2019.\nClient relationships are important to our brand licensing and consumer relationship marketing businesses. Our ability to maintain existing client relationships and generate new clients depends significantly on the quality of our products and services, our reputation, and the continuity of Company and client personnel. Dissatisfaction with our products and services, damage to our reputation, or changes in key personnel could result in a loss of business.\nIncreases in paper and postage prices, which are difficult to predict and control, could adversely affect our results of operations. Paper and postage represent significant components of our total cost to produce, distribute, and market our printed products. In fiscal 2018, these expenses accounted for 11 percent of national media\u2019s operating costs. Paper is a commodity and its price can be subject to significant volatility. All of our paper supply contracts currently provide for price adjustments based on prevailing market prices; however, we historically have been able to realize favorable paper pricing through volume discounts. The USPS distributes substantially all of our subscription magazines and many of our marketing materials. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the USPS and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Although we work with others in the industry and through trade organizations to encourage the USPS to implement efficiencies that will minimize rate increases, we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude of future price changes for paper and postage. Further, we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers.\nAcquisitions pose inherent financial and other risks and challenges. As a part of our strategic plan, we have acquired businesses and we expect to continue acquiring businesses in the future. These acquisitions can involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability. Such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty in integrating personnel, operations, and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; and acquisition-related earnings charges. If our acquisitions are not successful, we may record impairment charges. Our ability to continue to make acquisitions will depend upon our success at identifying suitable targets, which requires substantial judgment in assessing their values, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability, as well as the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices and whether restrictions\nare imposed by regulations. Moreover, competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant, particularly in the fields of broadcast stations and digital media. Even if successfully negotiated, closed, and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is possible, depending upon future operating results and the value of the Company\u2019s stock. Although the Company wrote down certain of its intangible assets, including goodwill and trademarks, by $22.7 million in fiscal 2018, $5.3 million in fiscal 2017, and $155.8 million in fiscal 2016, further impairment charges are possible. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of every fiscal year and on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist. Factors which influence the evaluation include, among many things, the Company\u2019s stock price and expected future operating results. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is no longer deemed to be recoverable, a potentially material non-cash impairment charge could be incurred. At June 30, 2018, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $3.9 billion, or 58 percent of Meredith\u2019s total assets, with $3.0 billion in the national media segment and $907.1 million in the local media segment. The review of goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company has three reporting units - national media, local media excluding MNI, and MNI. We performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of May 31, 2018. The fair value of the national media reporting unit exceeded its net assets by 15 percent. The impairment analysis assumed only 50 percent of the synergies expected to be realized from the acquisition of Time. Had 100 percent of the synergies been incorporated into the future cash flows in the impairment analysis, the fair value would have exceeded carrying value by 43 percent. Qualitative impairment analyses were performed for the local media excluding MNI reporting unit and the MNI reporting unit and resulted in no indications of impairment and thus, no quantitative assessments were necessary. Changes in key assumptions about the economy or business prospects used to estimate fair value or other changes in market conditions could result in additional impairment charges. Although these charges would be non-cash in nature and would not affect the Company\u2019s operations or cash flow, they would reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and reported results of operations in the period charged.\nWe have three classes of stock with different voting rights. We have three classes of stock: Series A preferred stock, common stock, and class B stock. The Series A preferred stock is non-voting. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share and account for 44 percent of the voting power. Holders of class B stock are entitled to ten votes per share and account for the remaining 56 percent of the voting power. There are restrictions on who can own class B stock. The majority of Class B shares are held by members of Meredith\u2019s founding family. Control by a limited number of holders may make the Company a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This voting control also prevents other shareholders from exercising significant influence over certain of the Company\u2019s business decisions.\nAdverse changes in the equity markets or interest rates, changes in actuarial assumptions and legislative or other regulatory actions could substantially increase our United Kingdom (U.K.) pension costs and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Through one of our U.K. subsidiaries acquired with the acquisition of Time, the Company sponsors the IPC Media Pension Scheme (the IPC Plan), a defined benefit pension plan that is closed both to new participants and to the future accrual of additional benefits for current participants. The majority of pensions in payment and deferred pensions in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension are increased annually in line with the increase in the retail price index up to a maximum of 5 percent. Concurrently with the acquisition of Time, the Company was substituted for Time as the guarantor of all obligations of the statutory employers under the IPC Plan.\nThe most recent triennial valuation of the IPC Plan under U.K. pension regulations was completed as of April 5, 2015. Under the assumptions used in such valuation, which are more conservative than the assumptions used to determine a pension plan\u2019s funded status in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the IPC Plan was deemed to be underfunded at that time by approximately \u00a3156 million. A triennial valuation of the IPC Plan is currently in process and once completed, will be as of April 5, 2018.\nUnder the current deed of guarantee, the Company would be obligated to fund the IPC Plan\u2019s \u201cbuyout deficit\u201d (i.e., the amount that would be needed to purchase annuities to discharge the benefits under the plan) under certain\ncircumstances. Specifically, the Company would be required to deposit the buyout deficit into escrow if its debt in excess of $50 million were not to be paid when due or were to come due prior to its stated maturity as a result of a default (a Major Debt Acceleration) or if a Covenant Breach were to occur (as described below). The Company would be permitted to recoup the escrowed funds under certain circumstances. However, if the Company, as the sponsor, was to become insolvent, or if a Major Debt Acceleration were to occur (without being promptly cured), any escrowed funds would be immediately contributed into the IPC Plan and the Company would be obligated to immediately contribute into the IPC Plan any shortfall in the buyout deficit amount.\nIn connection with the completion of the sale of all issued shares of TIUK on March 15, 2018, and the substitution of another U.K. subsidiary of the Company as the sole sponsor under the IPC Plan, the deed of guarantee was amended to remove requirements to deposit the buyout deficit as a result of certain credit rating triggers. At the same time, the Company agreed that the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Company\u2019s 2026 Senior Notes would guarantee the obligations of the Company under the IPC Plan on a pari passu basis with the obligations under the 2026 Senior Notes. In addition, the Company agreed to incorporate the terms of certain covenants under the indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes into the amended deed of guarantee effective as of March 15, 2018. If a breach of such covenants by the Company or the subsidiary guarantors occurs (after certain notice and cure periods) (a Covenant Breach), the Company would be required to deposit the buyout deficit (less the amount of certain types of security in favor of the IPC Plan, currently provided in the form of a surety bond) into escrow as described above.\nIf the Company had been required to fund the buyout deficit on June 30, 2018, the amount would have been approximately \u00a3138 million. The amount of the buyout deficit changes daily and is determined by many factors, including changes in the fair value of the IPC Plan assets and liabilities and interest rates.\nIt is possible that, following future valuations of the IPC Plan\u2019s assets and liabilities or following future discussions with the IPC Plan trustee, the annual funding obligation and/or the arrangements to ensure adequate funding for the IPC Plan will change. The future valuations under the IPC Plan can be affected by a number of assumptions and factors, including legislative changes, assumptions regarding interest rates, currency rates, inflation, mortality, and retirement rates, the investment strategy and performance of the IPC Plan assets, and (in certain limited circumstances) actions by the U.K. Pensions Regulator. Volatile economic conditions, including the U.K.\u2019s impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, could increase the risk that the funding requirements increase following the next triennial valuation. The U.K. Pensions Regulator also has powers under the Pensions Act 2004 to impose a contribution notice or a financial support direction on the Company (and other persons connected with the Company or the U.K. subsidiary which sponsors the IPC Plan) if, in the case of a contribution notice, the U.K. Pensions Regulator reasonably believes such person has been party to an act, or deliberate failure to act, intended to avoid pension liabilities or that is materially detrimental to the pension plan, or, in the case of a financial support direction, if a plan employer is a service company or insufficiently resourced and the Pensions Regulator considers it is reasonable to act against such a person. A significant increase in the funding requirements for the IPC Plan or in the calculated \u201cself-sufficiency deficit\u201d or the calculated \u201crisk-free self-sufficiency deficit\u201d could result in a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe preceding risk factors should not be construed as a complete list of factors that\nmay affect our future operations and financial results.", "PERMNO": 42796, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "MDP"}
