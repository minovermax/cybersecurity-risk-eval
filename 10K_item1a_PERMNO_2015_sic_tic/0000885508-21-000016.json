{"cik": "885508", "company": "STRATUS PROPERTIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts. For additional information, see \u201cCautionary Statement\u201d in Items 7. And 7A. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements are described below. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks discussed below are not the only risks we face. Other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may materially affect our business if they occur. Moreover, new risks emerge from time to time. Further, our business may also be affected by additional factors that generally apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, which have not been included.\nRisks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our business, which is likely to continue with unknown severity and for an unknown period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and stock price. The COVID-19 pandemic is complex and continuously evolving, with federal, state and local governments, and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, a variety of restrictions on activities in order to combat its spread. These restrictions have included stay-at-home orders, bans on travel, limitations on the size of gatherings, limitations on the operations of businesses, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, cancellation of events, quarantines and social distancing measures. State and local governments have implemented phased reopening processes, often with reduced capacity and social distancing restrictions. During 2020, there were declines followed by resurgences of COVID-19 cases throughout the U.S., and cases generally rose during the fourth quarter. Authorities have reacted to these resurgences by deferring the phasing out of restrictions and, in some instances, re-imposing restrictions. In December 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccines were approved for use in the U.S., and the early stages of distribution of the vaccine are in process as of the date of this report. Recently, variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been identified in the U.S. and elsewhere, and information about them is rapidly emerging, including how easily they might spread, whether they could cause more severe illness, and whether currently authorized vaccines will protect against them. Even if there is ultimately widespread distribution and acceptance of these vaccines, their long-term efficacy is unknown.\nThe pandemic has caused a sharp global slowdown of economic activity resulting in a recession in the U.S., a steep increase in unemployment in the U.S. and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The pandemic had a significant adverse impact on our company during 2020, particularly in our hotel and entertainment businesses, and is expected to continue to adversely impact our company in 2021. Because the pandemic is unprecedented in recent history, we cannot predict its future impact on our company with any certainty. In addition to the pandemic-related risks discussed below, we face the risk of potential cases of infection and transmission at our operations despite our safety measures efforts, which may lead to exposure to assertions of liability.\n\u2022 Risks Related to our Liquidity. Although we project that we will be able to meet our debt service and other cash obligations for at least the next 12 months, our projections are based on many detailed and complex underlying assumptions, including (1) that operating income for our Block 21 businesses will gradually ramp up to a break-even point in the first half of 2021 and that Block 21 will generate sufficient cash to cover debt service by early 2022, (2) that current conditions in our leasing operations will not deteriorate materially, and (3) that we close on projected asset sales in our real estate operations segment. No assurances can be given that the results anticipated by our projections will occur. If we later determine that we will likely not be able to meet our debt service and other cash obligations, or will likely not be able to meet covenants under our debt agreements, we may seek further amendments to, waivers of provisions of, or restructuring of our debt agreements, seek to sell assets, seek to reduce operating expenses, and/or seek to raise additional capital, any or all of which actions may not be successful. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, or otherwise default under a debt agreement, our\nlenders may declare all amounts outstanding under the loans due and payable, seek to foreclose on the collateral securing the loans and/or seek to force us into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.\n\u2022 Risks Related to our Hotel Operations. The pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on the hospitality industry, as it has resulted in dramatically curtailed business and leisure travel and caused cancellations of events or rescheduling of events. Accordingly, the pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in revenue from our hotel rooms, conference facilities and hotel amenities. The pandemic is expected to continue to negatively affect our hotel business, and the extent to which such adverse impacts continue depends on numerous evolving factors that we cannot predict. Moreover, even as travel advisories and restrictions are lifted, travel demand may remain weak for a significant length of time and attractions and events that previously brought visitors to the city of Austin may not proceed or may proceed with limited capacity. We cannot predict if or when our hotel will return to pre-pandemic demand or pricing.\n\u2022 Risks Related to our Entertainment Operations. The pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on the entertainment industry and our entertainment operations. The extent to which such adverse impacts continue depends on numerous evolving factors that we cannot predict, including if or when our entertainment operations will return to pre-pandemic demand or pricing.\n\u2022 Risks Related to our Leasing Operations. The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting our retail and, to a lesser extent, our multi-family leasing operations. As a result of the pandemic and the related economic downturn, our retail tenants have requested, and may continue to request, additional rent deferrals, rent abatement, lease renegotiations or early termination of their leases as well as may be forced to temporarily or permanently close or declare bankruptcy, which could further reduce our cash flows. Our multi-family tenants may request future rent deferrals. In addition, state, local or industry-initiated efforts, such as tenant rent freezes or suspension of a landlord\u2019s ability to enforce evictions, may also affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent. Further, our ability to renew leases or re-lease vacant spaces on favorable terms, or at all, is constrained in the current environment, which may worsen.\n\u2022 Risks Related to our Real Estate and Development Operations. The pandemic may negatively affect our real estate and development operations. We may be unable to sell or refinance assets in the current economic environment at a price that we find acceptable or at all. Also, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic could diminish the demand for and value of our properties for an indeterminate period. The pandemic has also constrained the availability of capital to companies in the real estate industry, and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access capital at a reasonable cost.\nRisks Relating to our Business, Industries and Indebtedness\nWe need significant amounts of cash to service our debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to secure land and pursue development and construction. Our business strategy requires us to rely on cash flow from operations and our debt agreements as our primary sources of funding. We have also, from time to time, relied on project-level equity financing of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, our outstanding debt totaled $351.1 million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.4 million. Our level of indebtedness could have significant adverse consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022Increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales to pay or provide for our indebtedness, thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022Limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022Force us to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms or restrict us from making strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022Place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022Limit our ability to obtain future financing to fund our working capital, our development activities, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other financing needs; and/or\n\u2022Limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or cause the refinancing terms to be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled debt service payments or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future operating and financial performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control, including risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, much of our debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. Our inability to extend, repay or refinance our debt when it becomes due, including upon a default or acceleration event, could allow our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the loans due and payable, seek to foreclose on the collateral securing the loans and/or seek to force us into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could also cause project delays, which could increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, make necessary capital expenditures, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, financial and restrictive covenants and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the required payment of such debt.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness include restrictive covenants, including covenants that require that certain financial ratios be maintained. Stratus' and its subsidiaries' debt arrangements contain significant limitations that may restrict Stratus' and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: borrow additional money or issue guarantees; pay dividends, repurchase equity or make other distributions to equityholders; make loans, advances or other investments; create liens on assets; sell assets; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; enter into transactions with affiliates; permit a change of control; sell all or substantially all of our assets; and engage in mergers, consolidations or other business combinations. See Note 6 for additional discussion of restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nFailure to comply with any of the restrictive covenants in our loan documents could result in a default that may, if not cured or waived, accelerate the payment under our debt obligations which would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to obtain waivers or modifications of covenants from our lenders and lenders may require fees or higher interest rates to grant any such requests. Certain of our debt arrangements have cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, which could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. We cannot assure you that we could adequately address any such defaults, cross-defaults or acceleration of our debt payment obligations in a sufficient or timely manner, or at all. Our ability to comply with our covenants will depend upon our future economic performance. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations, satisfy our capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be desirable or advantageous to us.\nIn order to maintain compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements and carry out our business plan, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital, including project-level equity financing of our subsidiaries. Such additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, when needed. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nThe success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business could be harmed by any slowdown or deterioration in the economy.\nPeriods of economic uncertainty, weakness or recession; significantly rising interest rates; declining employment levels; declining demand for real estate; declining real estate values; epidemic or pandemic illnesses or fear of the potential spread of illnesses such as COVID-19; or the public perception that any of these events or conditions may occur or be present, may negatively affect our business. These economic conditions can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents and increases in tenant defaults on rental payments, which in turn reduce revenue derived from property sales and leases. Other factors that could influence demand in our industries include labor costs, access to credit on reasonable terms, geopolitical issues and other macroeconomic factors. Periods of economic weakness or uncertainty also typically have an adverse impact on our hotel and entertainment operations, revenues and profits. During an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained, and it may take longer for us to dispose of or lease our real estate. As a result, the value of our real estate may be reduced, increasing the risk for asset impairments, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.\nIncreases in interest rates would increase our interest costs and the potential replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our interest costs.\nOur consolidated debt at December 31, 2020, was $351.1 million, the majority of which was variable-rate debt. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs and increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and incurring new debt, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow.\nThe London Inter-bank Offering Rate, or LIBOR, is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on variable-rate loans globally. We have used LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to these loans is calculated using LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021, for only the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. If LIBOR rates cease to be available, our debt with interest rates that are indexed to LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods to the extent provided for in our agreements, which could result in increases in interest rates on such debt. Further, before LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements and the loans that utilize LIBOR to replace LIBOR with another standard. While the full consequences of these developments cannot be predicted, they could result in higher interest costs.\nWe are vulnerable to concentration risks because our operations are primarily located in the Austin, Texas area.\nOur real estate operations are primarily located in the Austin, Texas area. While our real estate operations have expanded to include select markets in Texas outside of the Austin area, the geographic concentration of the majority of our operations and of the properties we may have under development at any given time means that our business is more vulnerable to local economic, regulatory, adverse weather and other conditions than the businesses of larger, more diversified companies. The performance of the Austin area's economy and our other select markets in Texas greatly affects our revenue and the values of our properties. We cannot assure you that these markets will continue to grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will continue to be favorable in these markets. See \u201cOverview - Real Estate Market Conditions\u201d in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. for more information.\nAdverse weather conditions or natural disasters, public health crises, public safety issues, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events in our Texas markets could adversely affect our business.\nAdverse weather conditions, including natural disasters, public health crises, public safety issues, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events in our Texas markets may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These events may delay development activities, interrupt our leasing, hotel and entertainment operations, or damage property resulting in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance. Any of these factors could cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, reduce property values, or cause a loss of revenue, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring February 2021, a severe winter storm caused extensive and sustained power outages, disruptions in the water supply, burst water pipes and other property damage throughout Texas. Record-breaking freezing temperatures in Austin left much of the city without power, which for some, lasted nearly a week. Further, the city of Austin experienced widespread water outages. Although the storm did not cause material damage to our properties, we cannot predict the extent to which the incident will impact our business prospects or the value of our properties over the longer term.\nOur insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate to cover any losses we may incur.\nWe maintain insurance on our properties, including business interruption, property, liability, fire and extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economical to insure. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles, for insurance, based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. In addition, we may become liable for injuries and accidents at our properties that are underinsured. A significant uninsured loss could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of certain key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business.\nWe depend on the experience and knowledge of our executive officers and other key personnel who guide our strategic direction and execute our business strategy, have extensive market knowledge and relationships and exercise substantial influence over our operations. Among the reasons that these individuals are important to our success is that each has a regional industry reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, community stakeholders and industry personnel. The loss of any of our key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business. Our success may also be dependent in part on our ability to continue to employ and retain other skilled personnel.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions and cybersecurity breaches.\nMany of our business processes depend on technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations and lower costs, and therefore, we are vulnerable to the increasing threat of information technology disruptions and cybersecurity breaches. These risks include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, employee theft or misuse and the corruption of data. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events. A significant theft, loss, loss of access to, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in a loss of business, as well as remedial and other expenses, fines, and litigation.\nWe have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. While these cybersecurity incidents did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our day-to-day operations, there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses in the future. Further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats.\nFailure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth.\nWe have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future, properties that are outside of the Austin, Texas area, which is our primary market. Our historical experience in existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets. Entering into new markets exposes us to a variety of risks, including difficulty evaluating local market conditions and local economies, developing new business relationships in the area, competing with other companies that already have an established presence in the area, hiring and retaining personnel, evaluating quality tenants in the area, and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. Furthermore, expansion into new markets may divert management's time and other resources away from our current primary market. As a result, we may not be successful in expanding into new markets, which could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth.\nPart of our business strategy depends on maintaining strong relationships with key tenants and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business.\nWe have formed strategic relationships with key tenants as part of our overall strategy for particular development projects and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future. For example, our West Killeen Market, Jones Crossing, Kingwood Place, Magnolia Place and New Caney mixed-use development projects are each anchored by an HEB grocery store. Any deterioration in our relationship with HEB or our inability to form and retain strategic relationships with key tenants or enter into other similar arrangements in the future could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Real Estate Operations\nThere can be no assurance that the properties in our development pipeline will be completed in accordance with the anticipated timing or cost.\nWe currently have several development projects at various levels of activity. The development of the projects in our development pipeline is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. We can provide no assurances that we will complete any of the projects in our development pipeline on the anticipated schedule or within the budget, or that, once completed, these properties will achieve the results that we expect. If the development of these projects is not completed in accordance with our anticipated timing or cost, or the properties fail to achieve the financial results we expect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and ability to repay our debt, including project-related debt.\nThe real estate business is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and financially stronger than we are, have more resources than we do, or have lower cost structures than we do.\nOur competitors include local developers who are committed primarily to particular markets and also national developers who acquire and develop properties throughout the U.S. Competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase the purchase prices for such properties. In addition, a downturn in the real estate industry could significantly increase competition among developers. An oversupply of real estate properties available for sale or lease may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected by any of these factors.\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are greatly affected by the performance of the real estate industry.\nRevenue from our real estate operations segment accounted for 37 percent of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The U.S. real estate industry is highly cyclical and is affected by changes in global, national and local economic conditions and events such as general employment and income levels, availability of financing, interest rates, consumer confidence and spending, and overbuilding of or decrease in demand for residential and commercial real estate. Our real estate activities are subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including local real estate market conditions (both where our properties are located and in areas where our potential customers reside), substantial existing and potential competition, national, regional and local economic, political and social conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, fluctuations in interest rates and mortgage availability, over-building in our markets, a decline in brick-and-mortar retail industry, changes in traffic patterns, changes in demographic conditions, changes in tenant preferences and changes in government regulations and requirements, including tax law changes. Any of the foregoing factors could result in lower than expected sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our profits and the timing and amounts of our cash flows.\nReal estate investments often cannot easily be converted into cash, and it is difficult to predict the level of future sales or sales prices that will be realized for individual assets. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms that would be acceptable to us. To the extent we are unable to sell any properties for our book value, we may be required to take a non-cash impairment charge or loss on the sale, either of which would reduce our net income or increase our net loss. See \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. for more information.\nOur operations are subject to an intensive regulatory approval process and opposition from environmental and special interest groups, either or both of which could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such developments entirely.\nReal estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. Before we can develop a property, we must obtain a variety of approvals from local and state governments with respect to such matters as zoning and other land use entitlements and issues, and subdivision, site planning and environmental issues under applicable regulations. Obtaining all of the necessary permits and entitlements to develop a parcel of land is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. In some situations, we may be unable to obtain the necessary permits and/or entitlements to proceed with a real estate development or may be required to alter our plans for the development. In addition, the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Any of these may limit, delay or increase the costs of acquisition of land and development of our properties. Because government agencies and special interest groups have, in the past, expressed concerns about certain of our development plans, and in the future may express similar concerns, our ability to develop these properties and realize future income from our properties could be delayed, reduced, prevented or made more expensive. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in capital or operating expenditures or significant financial penalties or restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect present and future operations or our ability to sell, and thereby, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to environmental regulation, which can change at any time and could increase our costs.\nReal estate development is subject to state and federal environmental regulations and to possible interruption or termination because of environmental considerations, including, without limitation, air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved and agency rulemaking and litigation are ongoing, the outcome of such rulemaking and litigation can be unpredictable, and at any time can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on or even the prohibition of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. Certain of our developments include habitats of endangered species. We have obtained the necessary permits from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to allow the development of our properties. However, future endangered species listings or habitat designations could impact development of our properties.\nUnder various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating through, whether generated from our property or other property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. The costs of removal or remediation, and the impact on the development potential and development timeline could be substantial. These laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. Environmental laws provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos and other airborne contaminants. In addition, third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal, state or local agencies review land developers\u2019 compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in project delays. We are making, and will continue to make, expenditures with respect to our real estate development for the protection of the environment. New environmental regulations or changes in existing regulations or their enforcement may be enacted and such new regulations or changes may require significant expenditures by us. The recent trend toward\nstricter standards in environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue and could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs.\nRisks Relating to Leasing Operations\nUnfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could negatively affect occupancy or rental rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations and ability to service our debt.\nRevenue from our leasing operations segment accounted for 38 percent of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, our leasing operations primarily involved the lease of retail space at retail and mixed-use properties that we developed to tenants in a variety of businesses, and the lease of residences in multi-family apartment complexes that we developed.\nThe average occupancy rates and rents at properties we develop and lease, particularly those that are newly constructed or have not stabilized, may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions, the development by competitors of competing retail or housing alternatives, or our inability to achieve stabilization of a property on schedule, any of which may result in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues.\nA decline in real estate market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy or rental rates, which could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations. The risks that could affect conditions in our markets include the following:\n\u2022Local conditions in the market, such as an oversupply of, or decrease in demand for, retail space or residential rental properties, or increased competition from other available retail buildings or apartment complexes;\n\u2022The inability or unwillingness of tenants to pay their current rent or rent increases; and\n\u2022Declines in market rental rates.\nOur rental revenues may be lower as a result of lower average occupancy rates, increased turnover, reduced rental rates, increased concessions and potential increases in uncollectible rent. In addition, we continue to incur expenses such as maintenance costs, insurance costs and property taxes, whether or not a property is occupied. Further, we may experience increases in our operating expenses, some or all of which may be out of our control. We cannot predict with certainty whether any of these conditions will occur or whether, and to what extent, they will have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may be unable to achieve and sustain satisfactory occupancy and rental rates at our retail and mixed use projects.\nWe face competition in attracting tenants to choose our retail and mixed-use projects over those of other developers and owners of similar properties. Once entered into, our retail leases typically range from five to ten years or longer. Further, we may be unable to renew existing leases as they come due. Adverse market or economic conditions that negatively impact our tenants\u2019 businesses could adversely impact their ability to meet their obligations under the leases or to renew the leases. These tenants face continual competition in attracting customers, often including from on-line competitors. Further, if we are unable to adapt to new technologies and relationships on a timely basis, our financial performance may be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to achieve and sustain satisfactory occupancy and rental rates at our apartment properties.\nWe also face competition in attracting tenants to our apartment complexes, including from other apartment properties as well as from condominiums and single-family homes available for rent or purchase. Once entered into, our apartment leases are typically for a term of 12 months. As these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. Further, we may be unable to renew existing leases as they come due. Adverse economic conditions that negatively impact our tenants' employment could adversely impact our tenants' ability to pay rent and/or cause tenants and potential tenants to prefer housing alternatives with lower rents. In\naddition, economic developments that favor home ownership over renting, such as low or declining interest rates, favorable or improving mortgage terms or a strong or strengthening job market, could also have an adverse impact on our apartment properties.\nRisks Relating to our W Austin Hotel\nAn adverse change in external perceptions of the W Austin Hotel could negatively affect the hotel\u2019s results of operations.\nOur W Austin Hotel is managed by W Hotel Management, Inc. a subsidiary of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Marriott International, Inc. The hotel\u2019s ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions and market recognition of the W hotel brand, of Starwood and Marriott as hotel operators and of the quality of the W Austin Hotel and its services. The reputation of the W Austin Hotel may be negatively affected if Marriott\u2019s or Starwood\u2019s reputations are damaged for any reason. In addition, we are required to spend money periodically to keep the property well maintained, modernized and refurbished in accordance with brand standards, which may be more costly than we anticipate.\nThe W Austin Hotel\u2019s revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if the W Austin Hotel is unable to compete effectively in the hotel industry in Austin.\nThe hotel industry in Austin is highly competitive. The W Austin Hotel competes for customers with other hotel and resort properties in Austin, ranging from national and international hotel brands to independent, local and regional hotel operators. We compete based on a number of factors, including quality and consistency of rooms, restaurant, bar and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of location and price, and other amenities. Historically, the Austin market has had a limited number of high-end hotel accommodations. However, hotel capacity is being expanded by other hotel operators in Austin, including several properties in close proximity to the W Austin Hotel in downtown Austin. Furthermore, travelers can book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms. Increased internet bookings of alternatives to hotel rooms could have an adverse effect on our hotel's occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room.\nThe W Austin Hotel is subject to the business, financial and operating risks common to the hotel industry, any of which could reduce its revenues and profitability.\nBusiness, financial and operating risks common to the hotel industry include:\n\u2022Changes in desirability of the hotel\u2019s location (i.e. Austin) as a travel destination;\n\u2022Decreases in the demand for hotel rooms and related lodging services in general, including a reduction in travel as a result of the spread of illnesses, pandemics or epidemics, alternatives to in-person meetings (including virtual meetings), increases in energy costs and other expenses affecting travel, decreased airline capacities and routes and the financial condition of the airline, automotive, and other transportation-related industries and its impact on travel;\n\u2022Over-building of hotels;\n\u2022Seasonal and cyclical volatility;\n\u2022Increases in fixed costs, including increases in commercial property taxes;\n\u2022Decreased corporate, governmental or convention travel-related spending;\n\u2022The quality of the services provided by the hotel and investments in the maintenance and improvement of the hotel;\n\u2022The costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations, including employment, health, safety and environmental laws;\n\u2022Information technology disruptions and cybersecurity breaches, including theft or fraudulent use of guest, employee, or company data and disruption of reservation systems; and\n\u2022Increases in operating costs including, but not limited to, energy, water, labor (including the effect of labor shortages, unionization and minimum wage increases), food, workers\u2019 compensation and health-care, insurance and unanticipated costs related to force majeure events and their consequences.\nAny of these factors could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nRisks Relating to our Entertainment Businesses\nOur entertainment businesses face intense competition in the live music industry, and they may not be able to maintain or increase their revenue or profits.\nOur entertainment businesses compete in a highly competitive industry and may not be able to maintain or increase their revenue as a result of such competition. The live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers\u2019 discretionary spending, and our venues compete with other venues to book artists. Our entertainment businesses\u2019 competitors compete for key personnel who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours. These competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists. Our competitors may develop services, advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those our entertainment businesses provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than our entertainment businesses achieve.\nOther variables related to our entertainment businesses that could adversely affect their financial performance include:\n\u2022Changes in consumer preferences and decreased success in offering events that appeal to customers;\n\u2022Technological changes and innovations that may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events, a loss of ticket sales or lower ticket fees;\n\u2022General economic conditions which could cause our consumers to reduce discretionary spending;\n\u2022Unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers via ticket prices;\n\u2022Event, tour and artist cancellations;\n\u2022Interruptions in our computer, communications, information and ticketing systems and infrastructures and data loss or other breaches of our network security;\n\u2022Occurrence and threat of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, intentional or unintentional mass-casualty incidents such as active shooter incidents, public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, weather conditions, natural disasters or similar events that may require us to cancel or reschedule an event; and\n\u2022Occurrence of personal injuries or accidents in connection with our live music events.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Shares of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded; therefore, our stock price may fluctuate more than the stock market as a whole and it may be difficult to sell large numbers of our shares at prevailing trading prices.\nAs a result of the thin trading market for shares of our common stock, our stock price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger public float, shares of our common stock will be less liquid than the shares of common stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, it may be difficult for investors to sell the number of shares they desire at an acceptable price. Trading of a relatively small volume of shares of our common stock may have a greater effect on the trading price than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:\n\u2022Provide for a classified Board serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022Authorize the Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u2022Establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022Limit who may call special stockholder meetings and prevent stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022Require a supermajority stockholder vote for certain transactions with a 20 percent stockholder, subject to certain exceptions, and for certain amendments to our charter.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us. These provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders.\nIn order to ensure our stockholders have the benefit of our exploration of a potential conversion to a real estate investment trust (REIT), our Board adopted a limited duration stockholder rights agreement (Rights Agreement), which may discourage a takeover attempt not approved by our Board.\nOn September 22, 2020, our Board adopted the Rights Agreement and declared a dividend of one right (Right) for each outstanding share of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (common stock), to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 2, 2020. In general terms, and subject to certain exceptions, the Rights Agreement limits a person\u2019s or group\u2019s ability to own 9.8 percent or more of the common stock without Board approval, as this may adversely impact our potential status as a REIT. The Rights Agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a large block of our shares of common stock. The Rights expire on the earliest to occur of certain events, including on December 31, 2021, unless stockholder approval of the Rights Agreement has been obtained on or prior to such time.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when and if they are declared by our Board. Further, our Comerica Bank credit facility prohibits us from paying a dividend on our common stock without the bank\u2019s prior written consent. Although we declared a special cash dividend on our common stock in March 2017 after receiving written consent from Comerica Bank, we may not pay special cash dividends in the future. Comerica Bank\u2019s consent to the payment of a dividend in March 2017 is not indicative of the bank\u2019s willingness to consent to the payment of future dividends. Additionally, our Comerica Bank loan agreements contain a restrictive covenant limiting common stock repurchases to $1.0 million in the aggregate during the term of the agreements. Any repurchases of our common stock in excess of $1.0 million would require a waiver from Comerica Bank. The declaration of future dividends and share repurchases, which is subject to our Board's discretion and the restrictions under our Comerica Bank loan agreements, will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, projected compliance with covenants in our debt agreements, outlook and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.\nStratus\u2019 potential conversion from a C-Corporation to a REIT is subject to various risks and uncertainties.\nOur Board has approved an in-depth exploration of a conversion from a C-Corporation to a REIT. We can provide no assurance as to when, if at all, we will convert to a REIT. There are several implementation, operational, financing and tax complexities to be addressed before we decide whether to pursue a REIT conversion. Our ability to qualify as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Stratus may not qualify as a REIT. Further, if we determine to convert to a REIT, we cannot give any assurance that we will remain qualified as a REIT. We may not be able to complete all of the necessary steps that must be taken in order to convert to a REIT, in the anticipated timeframe, or at all. There could be significant costs related to converting to and operating a REIT. Even if, after an in-depth exploration, it is determined that there are no impediments to a REIT conversion, we cannot provide any assurance that our Board will approve a REIT conversion. Even if our Board approves a conversion from a C-Corporation to a REIT, our stockholders may not approve changes to Stratus\u2019 organizational documents consistent with a public REIT structure. Additionally, the REIT conversion would require consent from our major lenders and amendments to our major debt agreements, among other third-party consents. We cannot provide any assurance that we will receive the necessary consents to move forward with the REIT conversion. If we convert from a C-Corporation to a REIT, we cannot provide any assurance that the anticipated benefits will be realized by us or our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 77790, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "STRS"}
