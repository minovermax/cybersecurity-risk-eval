{"cik": "1629261", "company": "Long Island Iced Tea Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, which could negatively affect our sales.\nOur industry is highly competitive. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources, including Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and Arizona Beverage Company. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. We also compete against a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers. Smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. Our inability to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales. We are subject to competition from companies, including from some of our customers, that either currently manufacture or are developing products directly in competition with our products. These generic or store-branded products may be a less expensive option for consumers than our products making it more difficult to sell our product. As a result, we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing, advertising and product innovation. Any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, trends, health concerns and other factors. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends, then quickly develop new products, our sales could suffer.\nConsumers\u2019 preferences can change due to a variety of factors, including aging of the population, social trends, negative publicity, economic downturn or other factors. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences, then quickly develop new products in response, our sales could suffer. Developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive. We may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences, and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes, either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nCosts for our raw materials may increase substantially, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nThe principal raw materials we use in our business are bottles, caps, labels, packaging materials, tea essence and tea base, sugar, natural flavors and other sweeteners, juice, electricity, fuel and water. The cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially. We may not be able to pass along any increases in such costs to our customers or consumers, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. We presently do not mitigate our exposure to volatility in the prices of raw materials through the use of forward contracts, pricing agreements or other hedging arrangements.\nCertain raw materials we use are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In the event our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases.\nMost of the raw materials we use are available from only a few suppliers. If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers\u2019 financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. Any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.\nSubstantial disruption to production at our third party beverage co-packing facilities and our storage facilities could occur, which could disrupt or delay our production or cause us to incur substantially higher costs.\nOur products are currently produced by three established co-packing companies. A disruption in our production at, or our relationships with, our third party beverage co-packing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at any of our storage facilities or those of our suppliers, co-packers or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely, in part, on our third party beverage co-packing facilities to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of this co-manufacturer to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product recall and could adversely affect our reputation.\nWe take great care in ensuring the quality and safety in the manufacture of our products. Our third-party co-manufacturer is required to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications and requirements for certain certifications. Our third-party co-manufacturer is also required to comply with Food and Drug Administration requirements for manufacturing of our product. However, our products could still otherwise become contaminated. A contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. Moreover, negative publicity could be generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may be subject to litigation. The cost of defending against such litigation and the negative publicity related to such litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability or negatively affect our operating results. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see the item \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this annual report on 10-K\nFluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income. Historically, sales during the second and third fiscal quarters have generally been the highest. Any factors that harm our second or third quarter operating results, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance.\nIn order to prepare for our peak selling season, we must produce and keep in stock more inventory than we would carry at other times of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak selling season could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross profit.\nA deterioration of global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and result of operations.\nDisruptions in the global credit and financial markets and in economic conditions generally may include diminished liquidity and credit availability, a decline in consumer confidence, a decline in economic growth, an increased unemployment rate and uncertainty about economic stability. Such disruptions may affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Any adverse global economic conditions and tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions.\nOur sales growth is dependent upon maintaining our relationships with existing distributors and retailers and the loss of any one such distributor or retailer could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nCertain retailers that we service primarily through our distributors make up a significant percentage of our products\u2019 retail volume, including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. We also sell directly to certain retail accounts and to the distribution facilities of such retailers. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. For the year ended December 31, 2016, two customers, Seba Distribution LLC and Garden Foods accounted for 20% and 11% of our net sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, one customer, Wakefern Food Corp., accounted for 10% of net sales. The loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nFood and beverage retailers in the U.S. have been consolidating which may reduce our ability to increase both our revenue and our gross margins.\nConsolidation has resulted in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. If we, and our bottlers and distributors, do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer.\nWe do not have any contracts with our customers that require the purchase of a minimum amount of our products. The absence of such contracts could result in periods during which we must continue to pay costs and service indebtedness with reduced sales.\nOur customers do not provide us with firm, long-term or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result of the absence of such contracts, we could have periods during which we have no or limited orders for our products, but we will continue to have to pay our costs, including those to maintain our work force and service our indebtedness with reduced sales. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely find new customers to supplement periods where we experience no or limited purchase orders or that we can recover fixed costs as a result of experiencing reduced purchase orders. Periods of no or limited purchase orders for our products could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cause us to incur losses. Conversely, we may experience unanticipated increased orders for our products from these customers that can create supply chain problems and may result in orders we may be unable to meet. Unanticipated fluctuations in product requirements by our customers could result in fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter.\nWe have developed a gallon product line in which our gross margins are minimal, and therefore may not generate sufficient revenues or other benefits to justify its introduction. In addition, the gallon product line may divert sales from our higher margin 20oz product line, which would adversely affect our business.\nIn May 2015, we developed a gallon product line featuring five of our existing flavors. Our gross margins on this product line are minimal. Accordingly, this product line may not generate sufficient revenues or other benefits to justify its introduction. In addition, to the extent distributors choose to carry the gallon product line instead of our higher margin 20oz product line, it may negatively affect our operating results, specifically our gross margin. Although we believe the gallon size has a different function and manner of consumption, consumers may choose to purchase the gallon size instead of the 20oz size, because the gallon size offers a better per ounce value. This would result in an overall lower gross margin for our business.\nWe do not have registered ownership of certain of our trade names and our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property, including termination of distribution rights, could harm our business.\nWe possess intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property includes our logo, trademarks for \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d and \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand,\u201d various other trademarks, copyrights, patents, ingredient formulas, business processes and other trade secrets. However, we do not currently have registered ownership of the trademark \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d and do not have registered ownership on the principal register of the trademark \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d as described below. We and third parties, including competitors, could come into conflict over intellectual property rights. Litigation could disrupt our business, divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. Our business is also highly dependent upon our distribution rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, including the right to our trade name and logo, our brands, products and business could be harmed and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOn April 19, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Officer, or the \u201cUSPTO,\u201d registered our mark \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d (Registration No. 4,943,056) on the supplemental register. Registration on the supplemental register allows the use of the \u201c\u00ae\u201d symbol, blocks later filed applications for confusingly similar marks, and allows us to sue infringers in federal court, which has well-settled case law and standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the supplemental register does not provide all the protection of a registration on the principal register. As with any other registered mark, we may be open to claims of others contesting the trademark.\nIn addition, we have filed trademark applications for \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d as a standard character mark and as a stylized mark, which applications are pending review by the USPTO. The applications are for use of the trademarks with iced tea, tea based products, juices, water, beverages and other similar products. We also plan to file for stylized marks protecting certain other tag lines and product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d (standard character mark and stylized mark), the USPTO has made an initial determination that both marks are geographically descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded us the opportunity to produce evidence to establish that the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. There can be no assurance that the USPTO will approve these applications.\nIf we incur substantial debt, it could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1,385,775 of total indebtedness, consisting principally of a draw of $1,280,275 on a fully collateralized line of credit that we maintain. In addition, we may obtain up to a maximum of $3,500,000 in advances under the Credit Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, including a requirement that we obtain prior approval of Brentwood for each advance. While our existing level of debt is not substantial and we may pay interest that accrues on any future loans under the Credit Agreement by capitalizing the interest and adding it to the principal balance of such loans, we may incur significant indebtedness in the future, including through advances under the Credit Agreement, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service such debt as cash payments become due. If new debt and/or new credit sources are added to our existing debt and credit sources, the related risks for us could intensify.\nIf we incur substantial debt, it could have important consequences. In particular, it could:\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf limit, along with the restrictive covenants of our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, if we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in the Credit Agreement or any other agreements governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit Agreement or such other agreements, including pursuant to any cross-default provisions of such agreements, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Furthermore, our lenders under the Credit Agreement could foreclose on their security interests in our assets, including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend the Credit Agreement or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nThe loss of the services of our key personnel could negatively affect our business, as could our inability to attract and retain qualified management, sales and technical personnel as and when needed.\nThe execution of our business strategy depends largely on the continued efforts of our executive management, including Julian Davidson (our Executive Chairman), Philip Thomas (co-founder of LIBB and our Chief Executive Officer), Richard Allen (our Chief Financial Officer) and Peter Dydensborg (our Chief Operating Officer). As we have a limited operating history, we are highly dependent upon these individuals\u2019 knowledge, experience and reputation within the industry. Any or all of these individuals may in the future choose to discontinue their employment with us. If so, we may not be able to find adequate replacements for them. Without their experience, expertise and reputation, our development efforts and future prospects would be substantially impaired. We have employment agreements in place with these individuals that include non-competition provisions.\nWe may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations, and they could change. Any violations could result in reputational damage or substantial penalties, and any changes could result in increased compliance costs.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S., and other countries in which we do business. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of food products is increasing. Certain state warning and labeling laws, such as California\u2019s \u201cProp 65,\u201d which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, could become applicable to our products. Some local and regional governments and school boards have enacted, or have proposed to enact, regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools. Any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, or disrupt the production or distribution of our products, and negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nOur ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available on terms favorable to us.\nThe ability of our business to grow and compete depends on the availability of adequate capital. We currently have negative cash flows from operations due in part to lower gross margins and operating expenses to build out our infrastructure and fulfil our public company obligations. We expect that our working capital, proceeds from recent stock offerings, and the commitment for financing from certain stockholders will be sufficient to meet our net cash requirements through March 31, 2018. However, we may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth strategy or for other purposes. In such event, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all. As a result, we cannot assure you that adequate capital will be available to finance our current growth plans, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business.\nWe have a limited operating history and history of operating losses, and there is no guarantee that we will achieve profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses. There is no guarantee that we will become a profitable business. Further, our future operating results depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to manage our growth, retain our customer base and to successfully identify and respond to emerging trends in our market areas.\nWhile we currently produce only non-alcoholic beverages, we are exploring entry into the alcoholic beverage industry. To the extent that we expand our operations into new sectors of the beverage industry, our business operations may suffer from a lack of experience, significant costs of entry and the competitive conditions in the market, among other factors, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exploring entry into the alcoholic beverage industry. As we principally have been engaged in the production of NARTD teas, we have limited experience with developing, producing, marketing and distributing alcoholic beverages. Additionally, we will be exposed to significant operating costs associated with developing new products and entering a new sector of the beverage industry and will face new regulatory burdens, which could have an adverse impact on our business as well as place us at a disadvantage relative to more established alcoholic beverage market participants. Furthermore, the alcoholic beverage industry is highly competitive. We will compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. In addition:\n\u25cf We may not be able to adequately distinguish our alcohol products from our non-alcohol products. Our inability to create the proper differentiation could result in customer confusion and could have adverse regulatory consequences.\n\u25cf We may not be able establish the proper infrastructure to support the supply chain from the manufacturing of the product to the ultimate purchase by the end consumer.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, we may be unsuccessful in expanding our business to include alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, attempting such an expansion will require a substantial investment of resources and management time, which could materially adversely affect our more established non-alcoholic beverage business as well. Accordingly, we can offer no assurance that if we expand our business beyond NARTD teas, we will be able to effectively develop, produce, market and distribute such beverages. Such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date. Any future decisions regarding dividends will be made by our board of directors. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future, but expect to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business. Therefore, any return on investments will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nA robust public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained, which could affect your ability to sell our common stock or depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on NASDAQ, but we cannot assure you that our common stock will continue to trade on this market or another national securities exchange. In addition, we are unable to predict whether an active trading market for our common stock will develop or will be sustained.\nThe trading price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price and volume of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Our stock has traded at a low of $3.73 to a high of $12.55 in since January 1, 2016. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the beverage industry and the financial markets generally;\n\u25cf the political, economic and social situation in the U.S.;\n\u25cf actual or expected variations in operating results;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, or other business developments;\n\u25cf adoption of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf operations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u25cf litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf purchase or sales of blocks of our common stock; and\n\u25cf operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.\nThere can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. You should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our common stock is low, as it historically has been.\nOur outstanding warrants and options will increase the number of shares outstanding and available for sale in the public markets, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe presently have outstanding (i) stock options to purchase 862,964 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $4.77 per share held by certain of our executive officers, directors and employees, (ii) warrants to purchase up to 404,475 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share that were issued in the private placements described herein, (iii) warrants to purchase up to 34,573 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share that were issued to Network 1 and its designees as compensation for acting as the placement agent for such private placements, and (iv) warrants to purchase up to 31,522 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share that were issued to Network 1 and its designees as compensation for acting as the placement agent for the Public Offering, and (v) warrants to purchase up to 165,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.18 per share that were issued to a stockholder in consideration of a commitment to fund the Company. If and to the extent these warrants and options are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings and/or it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock also may be adversely affected, if and to the extent the shares registered for resale pursuant to this prospectus are sold in the public markets.\nThe substantial number of shares that are eligible for sale pursuant to our resale registration statement could cause the market price for our common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future.\nWe have an effective registration statement registering the resale by certain of our stockholders of up to 4,348,889 shares of our common stock. Expectations that shares of our common stock may be sold by the selling stockholders could create an \u201coverhang\u201d that may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect on the market price of our common stock from time to time as a result of (i) sales by the stockholders of some or all of the 4,348,889 shares of our common stock under our resale registration statement, (ii) the availability of such shares of common stock for sale by the selling stockholders, or (iii) the perception that such shares may be offered for sale by the selling stockholders. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity securities more difficult. Any sale, or perceived impending sale, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe have the ability to issue additional shares of common stock and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of the common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue 35,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock. We have 25,108,400 authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance after appropriate reservation for our outstanding options and warrants. The issuance of additional common stock may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, the terms of such preferred stock may materially adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of the common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nOur senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully manage a publicly traded company.\nNot all of our senior executive officers or directors have extensive experience managing a publicly traded company, and they may not be successful in doing so. The demands of managing a publicly traded company, like ours, is much greater as compared to those of a private company, and some of our senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully meet those increased demands.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely, or may rely, on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, the price of our common stock may be reduced, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nIn addition, under the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2020, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. For as long as we take advantage of the reduced reporting obligations, the information that we provide stockholders may be different from information provided by other public companies.\nObligations associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the \u201cExchange Act,\u201d and the other rules and regulations of the SEC, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources, make certain activities more time-consuming and cause us to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In order to comply with these obligations, we may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, expand or outsource our internal audit function, and hire additional accounting and finance staff. Because our resources are limited compared to many public companies, these requirement may impose a disproportionate financial burden on us. Furthermore, our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties in complying with these reporting and other requirements and prevent us from focusing on executing our business strategy. In addition, if we are unable to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d we intend to continue to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and other scaled disclosure requirements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In general, we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2020, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, and will remain a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for each fiscal year where our public float remains below $75 million as of the last day of the second fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year. We intend to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions and reduced reporting requirements until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and/or a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d at which time, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with these additional requirements.", "PERMNO": 16175, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "LBCC"}
