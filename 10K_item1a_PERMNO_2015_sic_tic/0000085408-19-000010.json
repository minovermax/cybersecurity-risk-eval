{"cik": "85408", "company": "ROWAN COMPANIES PLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of significant factors that might cause our future operating results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company.\nOur business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by declines in oil or gas prices and reduced demand for oil and gas products.\nOur business depends heavily on a variety of economic and political factors and the level of oil and gas activity worldwide. Sustained declines in oil or natural gas prices, combined with market expectations of a prolonged weakened global market, have caused oil and gas companies to significantly reduce their exploration, development and production activities, thereby decreasing demand for offshore drilling services and leading to lower rig utilization and day rates for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been very volatile, and our drilling operations have in the past suffered through long periods of weak market conditions.\nDemand for our drilling services depends on many factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide demand for and prices of oil and natural gas, and expectations regarding future energy prices;\n\u2022\nthe supply of drilling units in the worldwide fleet versus demand;\n\u2022\nthe level of exploration and development expenditures by energy companies and their ability to raise capital;\n\u2022\nthe willingness and ability of the OPEC to limit production levels and influence prices;\n\u2022\nthe level of production in non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nthe effect of economic sanctions that affect the energy industry;\n\u2022\nthe general economy, including inflation, interest rates and changes in the rate of economic growth;\n\u2022\nthe condition of global capital markets;\n\u2022\nadverse sea, weather and climate conditions in our principal operating areas, including possible disruption of exploration and development activities due to loop currents, hurricanes and other severe sea and weather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nenvironmental and other laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolicies of various governments regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nnationalization of assets or workforce and/or confiscation of assets;\n\u2022\nworldwide tax policies and treaties;\n\u2022\npolitical and military conflicts in oil-producing areas and the effects of terrorism;\n\u2022\nincreased supply of oil and gas from onshore development and relative cost of offshore drilling versus onshore oil and gas production;\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels and energy sources including the growing demand, often government-mandated, for electric powered vehicles; and\n\u2022\nmerger, divestiture, restructuring and consolidation of our customers and competitors and their assets.\nAdverse developments affecting the industry as a result of one or more of these factors, including declines in oil or gas prices or the failure of oil or gas prices to increase, a global recession, declines in demand for oil and gas products, increased oversupply\nof drilling units, and increased regulation of drilling and production, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to secure contracts for our drilling units at sufficient day rates. Depressed oil and gas prices and an oversupply of drilling units have led to weak rig utilization and day rates, which may materially impact our profitability.\nOur ability to meet our cash flow obligations depends on our ability to secure ongoing work for our drilling units at sufficient day rates. As of February 13, 2019, we had two jack-up drilling units that are currently cold-stacked; seven with contract terms ending in 2019; two with contract terms ending in 2020; one with a contract term ending in 2021; and nine leased to ARO with leases ending in 2021. Additionally, one of our four drillships is without a contract; two have a contract ending in 2019 and one has a contract ending in 2020. Given current market conditions, future demand for offshore drilling units may continue at low day rate levels, possibly for an extended period of time. Failure to secure profitable contracts for our drilling units could negatively impact our operating results and financial position, impair our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditures and/or meet our other obligations.\nPrior to the downturn in the drilling sector, the industry experienced a significant increase in construction activity. The resulting increase in supply of newbuild drilling units, combined with the decrease in demand for offshore drilling services, has led to an oversupply of drilling units and levels of utilization and day rates that are expected to remain weak for some time. According to industry sources, there were 451 marketed jack-up rigs worldwide as of February 13, 2019, an additional 77 units that are under construction or on order and 196 marketed floaters (drillships and semi-submersible) worldwide, with an additional 31 units that are under construction or on order. A decline in utilization and day rates would further impact our revenue and profitability.\nA decline in the market for contract drilling services could result in additional asset impairment charges.\nWe recognized asset impairment charges on our jack-up drilling units aggregating approximately $34 million in 2016, or approximately 0.5% of our fixed asset carrying values. Prolonged periods of low utilization and day rates, the cold-stacking of idle assets, or the sale of assets below their then carrying value could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges on our drilling units if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. See \u201cImpairment of Long-lived Assets\u201d in Note 2 of the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nWe are subject to operating risks that could result in environmental damage, property loss, personal injury, death, business interruptions and other losses.\nOur drilling operations are subject to many operational hazards such as blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, punch-throughs (i.e., when one leg of a jack-up rig breaks through the hard crust of the ocean floor, placing stress on the other legs), mechanical or technological failures, navigation errors, or equipment defects that could increase the likelihood of accidents. Accidents can result in:\n\u2022\nserious damage to or destruction of property and equipment;\n\u2022\npersonal injury or death;\n\u2022\ncostly delays or cancellations of drilling operations;\n\u2022\ninterruption or cessation of day rate revenue;\n\u2022\nuncompensated downtime;\n\u2022\nreduced day rates;\n\u2022\nsignificant impairment of producing wells, leased properties, pipelines or underground geological formations;\n\u2022\ndamage to fisheries and pollution of the marine and coastal environment; and\n\u2022\nfines and penalties.\nOur drilling operations are also subject to marine hazards, whether at drilling sites or while equipment is under tow, such as a vessel capsizing, sinking, colliding or grounding. In addition, raising and lowering jack-up rigs and drilling into high-pressure formations are complex, hazardous activities, and we periodically encounter problems. Any ongoing change in weather or sea patterns or climate conditions could increase the adverse impact of marine hazards.\nIn past years, we have experienced some of the types of incidents described above, including punch-throughs and towing accidents resulting in lost or damaged equipment and high-pressure drilling accidents resulting in lost or damaged formations. Any future such events could result in operating losses and have a material impact on our business.\nThe global nature of our operations involves additional risks, particularly in certain jurisdictions.\nOur operations are diversified geographically although we have a concentrated presence in certain locations. Foreign operations are often subject to additional political, economic and other uncertainties, such as with respect to taxation policies, customs restrictions, local content requirements, regulatory requirements, currency convertibility and repatriation restrictions, security threats including terrorism, piracy, and the risk of asset expropriation. Political unrest and regulatory restrictions could halt operations or impact us in other unforeseen ways, especially in areas of concentrated presence (see Note 14 of the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report).\nMany countries have regulations or policies requiring or rewarding the participation of local companies and individuals in petroleum-related activities. Such participation requirements can include, without limitation, the ownership of oil and gas concessions, the hiring of local agents and partners, the procurement of goods and services from local sources, and the employment of local workers. The requirements can also include co-ownership of our drilling units, in whole or in part, by home country companies or citizens and /or require reflagging of our drilling units under the flag of the home country. The governments of many of these countries have become increasingly active in requiring higher levels of local participation which may increase our costs and risks of operating in these regions, thereby limiting our ability to enter into, relocate from, or compete in these regions.\nIn addition, our inability to obtain visas and work permits for our employees in the jurisdictions in which we operate on a timely basis could delay or interrupt our operations resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Further, governmental restrictions in some jurisdictions may make it difficult for us to move our personnel, assets and operations in and out of these regions without delays or downtime.\nIn certain jurisdictions where legal protections may be less available to us, we assume greater risk that our customer may terminate contracts without cause on short notice, contractually or by governmental action. Additionally, operations in certain areas, such as the North Sea and US GOM, are highly regulated and have higher compliance and operating costs in general.\nAlthough we are a U.K. company, a significant majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in USD, which is our functional currency. However, in certain countries in which we operate, local laws or contracts may require us to receive some portion of payment in the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk to the extent the amount of our monetary assets denominated in the foreign currency differs from our obligations in that foreign currency. In order to mitigate the effect of exchange rate risk, we attempt to limit foreign currency holdings to the extent they are needed to pay liabilities denominated in the foreign currency. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to convert into USD or utilize such foreign currency holdings due to controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. For more information, see \u201cAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\u201d in Note 8 of the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe offshore drilling industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.\nThe offshore contract drilling industry is a highly competitive and cyclical business characterized by numerous competitors, high capital and operating costs and evolving capability of newer rigs. Drilling contracts are often awarded on a competitive-bid basis, and intense price competition, rig availability, location and suitability, experience of the workforce, efficiency, safety performance record, technical capability and condition of equipment, operating integrity, reputation, industry standing, and client relations are all factors in determining which contractor is awarded a contract. Our future success and profitability will partly depend upon our ability to keep pace with our customers\u2019 demands with respect to these factors.\nIn addition to intense competition, our industry has historically been cyclical. The contract drilling industry is currently in a period of low demand for offshore drilling services and excess rig supply, resulting from a prolonged period of weak oil and gas prices and reduced worldwide drilling activity. These conditions have intensified the competition in the industry and put significant downward pressure on day rates. As a result, we may be unable to secure profitable contracts for our drilling units, we may have to contract our rigs at substantially lower rates for long periods of time, enter into nontraditional fee arrangements, accept less favorable contract terms or idle or cold-stack some of our drilling units, all of which would adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and financial position.\nWe may experience reduced profitability if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our drilling contracts, and our backlog of drilling revenue may not be fully realized.\nWe may be subject to the increased risk of our customers seeking to terminate or renegotiate their contracts. Our customers\u2019 ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts with us may also be adversely affected by their own financial position, restricted credit markets and the current industry downturn. If our customers cancel or are unable to renew some of their contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, if contracts are disputed or suspended for an extended period of time, or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, such events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our term drilling contracts may be canceled by the customer without penalty upon the occurrence of events beyond our control such as the loss or destruction of the drilling unit, or the suspension of drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment. While most of our contracts require the customer to pay a termination fee in the event of an early cancellation without cause, early termination payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract and could result in the drilling unit becoming idle or cold-stacked for an extended period of time. If we or our customers are unable to perform under existing contracts for any reason or replace terminated contracts with new contracts having less favorable terms, our backlog of estimated revenue would decline, adversely affecting our financial results.\nWe must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain and upgrade our drilling fleet.\nOur business is highly capital intensive and dependent on having sufficient cash flow and or available sources of financing in order to fund capital expenditure requirements. We can provide no assurance that we will have access to adequate or economical sources of capital to fund necessary capital and operating expenditures.\nWe have and will likely continue to have certain customer concentrations, and the loss of a significant customer would adversely impact our financial results.\nA concentration of customers increases the risks associated with any possible (i) termination or nonperformance of drilling contracts, (ii) failure to renew contracts or award new contracts, or (iii) reduction of our customers' drilling programs. In 2018, four customers accounted for 56% of our consolidated revenue (Saudi Aramco - 28%; Anadarko - 14%; ARO Drilling - 14%; BP Trinidad and Tobago - 10%). The loss or material reduction of business from a significant customer would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, our drilling contracts subject us to counterparty risks. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control such as the overall financial condition of the counterparty. Should a significant counterparty fail to honor its obligations under an agreement with us, we could sustain losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we or our customers are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for drilling operations, we may be forced to suspend or cease our operations, and our profitability may be reduced.\nCrude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations require numerous permits and approvals for us and our customers from governmental agencies in the areas in which we operate. In addition, many governmental agencies have increased regulatory oversight and permitting requirements in recent years. If we or our customers are not able to obtain necessary permits and approvals in a timely manner, our operations will be adversely affected. Obtaining all necessary permits and approvals may necessitate substantial expenditures to comply with the requirements of these permits and approvals. Future changes to these permits or approvals or any adverse change in the interpretation of existing permits and approvals could result in further unexpected, substantial expenditures. In addition, such regulatory requirements and restrictions could also delay or curtail our operations, require us to make substantial expenditures to meet compliance requirements, and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations and may create a risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to function as planned.\nFor example, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and BSEE, have implemented significant environmental and safety regulations applicable to drilling operations in the US GOM. These regulations have at times adversely impacted the ability of our customers to obtain necessary permits and approval on a timely basis and/or to continue operations uninterrupted under existing permits.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of the ARO joint venture and it may introduce additional risks to our business.\nIn November 2016, Rowan and Saudi Aramco announced plans to form a 50/50 joint venture with Rowan and Saudi Aramco each selling existing drilling units and contributing capital as the foundation of the new company. The new entity, ARO, commenced operations on October 17, 2017, and is expected to add up to 20 newbuild jack-up rigs to its fleet over ten years commencing as early as 2021. There can be no assurance that the new jack-up rigs will begin operations as anticipated or we will realize the\nexpected return on our investment. We may also experience difficulty jointly managing the venture, and integrating our existing employees, business systems, technologies and services with those of Saudi Aramco in order to operate the joint venture efficiently. Further, in the event ARO has insufficient cash from operations or is unable to obtain third party financing, we may periodically be required to make additional capital contributions to ARO, up to a maximum aggregate contribution of $1.25 billion, which could affect our liquidity position. As a result of these risks, it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from ARO or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated. Additionally, if we are unable to make any required contributions, our ownership in ARO could be diluted which could hinder our ability to effectively manage ARO and harm our operating results or financial condition.\nOperating through ARO, in which we have a shared interest, may also result in us having less control over many decisions made with respect to projects and internal controls relating to projects. ARO may not apply the same internal controls and internal control reporting that we follow. As a result, internal control issues may arise, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to establish or preserve our relationship with our joint venture partner, we may agree to risks and contributions of resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we could receive, which could reduce our income and return on our investment in ARO compared to what we may traditionally require in other areas of our business.\nIncreases in regulatory requirements could significantly increase our costs or delay our operations.\nMany aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulation, including equipping and operating vessels, drilling practices and methods, and taxation. For example, operations in certain areas, such as the US GOM and the North Sea, are highly regulated and have higher compliance and operating costs in general. We may be required to make significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that such laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or result in a reduction of revenue associated with downtime required to implement regulatory requirements.\nOil and gas operations in many of the locations in which we operate are subject to regulation with respect to well design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system, or SEMS. New regulations continue to be implemented, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well-control systems and lifesaving systems, as well as rules regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third-party audits of SEMS programs. Such new regulations may require modifications or enhancements to existing systems and equipment, or require new equipment, and could increase our operating costs and cause downtime for our units if we are required to take any of them out of service between scheduled surveys or inspections, or if we are required to extend scheduled surveys or inspections to meet any such new requirements. Additional governmental regulations concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of our operations and could reduce exploration activity in the areas in which we operate.\nGovernments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas, and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. These governmental regulations may limit or substantially increase the cost of drilling activity in an operating area generally. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities. In addition, the offshore drilling industry is highly dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas industry and accordingly, regulations of the production and transportation of oil and gas generally could impact demand for our services.\nRegulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.\nGovernments around the world are increasingly focused on enacting laws and regulations regarding climate change and regulation of greenhouse gases. Lawmakers and regulators in the jurisdictions where we operate have proposed or enacted regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and the restriction thereof. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues and impose reductions of hydrocarbon-based fuels. Laws or regulations incentivizing or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy have also been enacted in certain jurisdictions. Numerous large cities globally and a few countries have mandated conversion from internal combustion engine powered vehicles to electric-powered vehicles and placed restrictions on non-public transportation, thereby reducing future demand for oil which could have a material impact on our business. Laws, regulations, treaties and international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may unfavorably impact our business, our suppliers and our customers, and result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions and could reduce drilling in the offshore oil and gas industry, all of which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur drilling units are subject to damage or destruction by severe weather, and our drilling operations may be affected by severe weather conditions.\nOur drilling rigs are located in areas that frequently experience hurricanes and other forms of severe weather conditions. These conditions can cause damage or destruction to our drilling units. Further, high winds and turbulent seas can cause us to suspend operations on drilling units for significant periods of time. Even if our drilling units are not damaged or lost due to severe weather, we may experience disruptions in our operations due to evacuations, reduced ability to transport personnel or necessary supplies to the drilling unit, or damage to our customers\u2019 platforms and other related facilities. Additionally, our customers may not choose to contract our rigs for use during hurricane season, particularly in the US GOM. Future severe weather could result in the loss or damage to our rigs or curtailment of our operations, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTaxing authorities may challenge our tax positions, and we may not be able to realize expected benefits.\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations and treaties in many jurisdictions. Changes to these laws or interpretations could affect the taxes we pay in various jurisdictions. Our tax positions are subject to audit by relevant tax authorities who may disagree with our interpretations or assessments of the effects of tax laws, treaties, or regulations, or their applicability to our corporate structure or certain of our transactions we have undertaken. We could therefore incur material amounts of income tax cost in excess of currently recorded amounts if our positions are challenged and we are unsuccessful in defending them.\nChanges in or non-compliance with tax laws and changes to our income tax estimates could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn 2012, we changed our legal domicile to the U.K. There have been legislative proposals in the U.S. that attempted to treat companies that have undertaken similar transactions as U.S. corporations subject to U.S. taxes or to limit the tax deductions or tax credits available to U.S. subsidiaries of these corporations. The realization of the expected tax benefits of our redomestication could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other tax authorities. Changes in our effective tax rates as determined from time to time, the inability to realize anticipated tax benefits, or the imposition of additional taxes could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in applicable regulations and accounting principles.\nChanges in our recorded tax estimates (including estimated reserves for uncertain tax positions) may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We do not provide for deferred income taxes on certain undistributed earnings of non-U.K. subsidiaries. If facts and circumstances cause a change in the expectations regarding future tax consequences, the resulting tax impact could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Act. The U.S. Tax Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws including but not limited to (i) reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% starting January 1, 2018, (ii) requiring a one-time transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of certain unremitted non-U.S. earnings as of December 31, 2017, (iii) changing how non-U.S. subsidiaries are taxed in the U.S. as of January 1, 2017, (iv) eliminating the carryback abilities and establishing an 80% limitation on the annual utilization of net operating losses after December 31, 2017, (v) establishing new limitations on interest deductions as of January 1, 2018, and (vi) requiring additional U.S. tax on certain payments by U.S. subsidiaries to non-U.S. subsidiaries if such payments are subject to reduced rates of U.S. withholding tax under a treaty after December 31, 2017. In 2017, the Company applied the guidance in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118) that allowed provisional estimates for the tax effects of the U.S. Tax Act. During 2018, the accounting for this matter has been finalized. For more information see Note 13 of the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nPolitical disturbances, war, or terrorist attacks and changes in global trade policies and economic sanctions could adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations are subject to political and economic risks and uncertainties, including instability resulting from civil unrest, political demonstrations, mass strikes, or an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas, which may result in extended business interruptions, suspended operations and danger to our employees, or result in claims by our customers of a force majeure situation and payment disputes. We are also subject to risks of terrorism, piracy, political instability, hostilities, expropriation, confiscation or deprivation of our assets or military action impacting our operations, assets or financial performance in many of our areas of operations. Finally, our business may be impacted by changes to trade policies or economic sanctions in places where we conduct or could conduct business.\nOperating and maintenance costs of our drilling units may be significant and could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. In addition, operational interruptions or maintenance or repair work may cause our customers to suspend or reduce payment of day rates until operation is resumed, which may lead to loss of revenue or termination or renegotiation of the drilling contract.\nMost of our drilling contracts provide for the payment of a fixed day rate during periods of operation and reduced day rates during periods of other activities. Given current market conditions, we may not be able to negotiate day rates sufficient to cover increased or unanticipated costs. Our operating expenses and maintenance costs can be unpredictable and depend on a variety of factors including: crew costs, costs of provisions, equipment, insurance, maintenance and repairs, customer and regulatory requirements, and shipyard costs, many of which are beyond our control. Our profit margins may therefore vary over the terms of our contracts, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers may be entitled to pay a waiting, or standby, rate lower than the full operational day rate if a drilling unit is idle for reasons that are not related to the ability of the rig to operate. In addition, if a drilling unit is taken out of service for maintenance and repair for a period of time exceeding the scheduled maintenance periods set forth in the drilling contract, we may not be entitled to payment of day rates until the unit is able to work. If the interruption of operations were to exceed a determined period, our customers may have the right to pay a rate that is significantly lower than the waiting rate for a period of time, and, thereafter, may terminate the drilling contracts related to the subject rig. Suspension of drilling contract payments, prolonged payment of reduced rates or termination of any drilling contract as a result of an interruption of operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur rig operating and maintenance costs include fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and day rates.\nWe do not expect our rig operating and maintenance costs to decline proportionately when rigs are not in service or when day rates decline. Fixed costs continue to accrue during out-of-service periods (such as shipyard stays and rig mobilizations preceding a contract), which represented approximately 9.3% of our available rig days in 2018. Operating revenue may fluctuate as rigs are recontracted at prevailing market rates upon termination of a contract, but costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only slightly variable regardless of the day rate being earned. Additionally, if our rigs are idle between contracts, we typically continue to incur operating and personnel costs because the crew is retained to prepare the rig for its next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate as some crew members may be required to assist in the rig's removal from service. Moreover, as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs may increase significantly.\nOur cost reduction initiatives might have unintended consequences and could negatively impact our business.\nIn response to changes in our industry, we have implemented and are considering implementing initiatives to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies. If we do not successfully manage these cost reduction activities, the expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or may not be realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. In addition, there is the risk that such measures could negatively impact our business by reducing our ability to respond to a significant increase in demand for our services, erroneously omitting operational or financial controls, reducing our pool of talent, adversely affecting employee morale, distracting management, or slowing improvements in our services, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining insurance in the future, and some of our losses may not be covered by insurance.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for damage to our drilling rigs, third-party liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other types of loss or damage. There are some losses, however, for which insurance may not be available or only available at much higher prices. For example, we do not currently maintain named windstorm physical damage coverage on any of our drilling units located in the US GOM.\nWe can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from potential consequences and damages, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future. A significant event which is not adequately covered by insurance and /or the failure of one or more of our insurance providers to meet claim obligations or losses or liabilities resulting from uninsured or underinsured events could have material adverse affects on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur contractual indemnification provisions may not be sufficient to cover our liabilities.\nOur drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification and allocation of liabilities between the parties with respect to liabilities resulting from various hazards associated with the drilling industry, such as loss of well control, well-bore pollution and damage to subsurface reservoirs and injury or death to personnel. The degree of indemnification we may receive from operators varies from contract to contract based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated, and recovery is dependent on the customer's financial condition. Our drilling contracts generally indemnify us for injuries and death of our customers\u2019 employees and loss or damage to our customers\u2019 property. Our service agreements generally indemnify us for injuries and death of our service providers\u2019 employees. However, the enforceability of our indemnities may be subject to differing interpretations, or further limited or prohibited under applicable law, particularly in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, punitive damages or punitive fines and/or penalties. The failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations, or losses or liabilities resulting from events excluded from or unenforceable under contractual indemnification obligations would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nWe depend heavily on technologies, systems and networks that we manage, and others that are managed by our third-party service and equipment providers or customers, to conduct our business and operations. In addition, we rely on our employees to vigilantly follow the Company\u2019s policies with respect to the use of these systems. Cybersecurity risks and threats to such systems have been encountered and continue to grow and may be difficult to anticipate, prevent, identify or mitigate. If any of our, our service providers' or our customers' security systems prove to be insufficient or our employees are not sufficiently vigilant, we could be adversely affected by having our business and financial systems compromised or made inoperable, our companies\u2019, employees\u2019, vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our (or our customers\u2019) business operations, financial systems or safety procedures disrupted, degraded or damaged. A breach or failure could also result in injury (financial or otherwise) to people, loss of control of, or damage to, our (or our customers\u2019) assets, harm to the environment, reputational damage, breaches of laws or regulations, litigation and other legal liabilities. In addition, we may incur significant costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity risks or events and to defend against any investigations, litigation or other proceedings that may follow such events. Such a failure or breach of our systems could adversely and materially impact our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws could result in fines, criminal penalties and drilling contract terminations and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to governmental officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operated and may in the future operate in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Any failure to comply with the FCPA, UK Bribery Act, or other anti-corruption laws due to our own acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of others, including our partners, agents or vendors, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which would adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participation in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling units or other assets.\nFailure to retain highly skilled personnel could hurt our operations.\nWe require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our rigs and provide technical services and support for our operations. In the past, during periods of high demand for drilling services and increasing worldwide industry fleet size, shortages of qualified personnel have occurred. The recent prolonged industry downturn may further reduce the number of qualified personnel available in the future. Such shortages could result in our loss of qualified personnel to competitors, impair the timeliness and quality of our work and create upward pressure on costs. If we are unable to retain or train skilled personnel, our operations and quality of service could be adversely impacted.\nWe are involved in litigation and legal proceedings from time to time that could have a negative effect on us if determined adversely.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings, which may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury, environmental, toxic tort, employment, tax and securities litigation, governmental investigations or proceedings, and litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. Although we intend to defend any of these matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter. Our profitability may be adversely affected by the outcome of claims or contract disputes, including any inability to collect receivables or resolve significant contractual or day rate disputes, and any purported nullification, cancellation or breach of contracts with customers or other parties. Litigation\nmay have an adverse effect on us because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with defending the lawsuits, the diversion of resources, reputational damage, and other factors.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to access the credit and debt capital markets.\nOur ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to meet our financial and operating needs is dependent upon our future performance, operating cash flows, and our access to credit and debt capital markets. In turn, our level of liquidity and access to credit and debt capital markets depends on general economic conditions, industry cycles, financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, as well as our credit ratings. Tightening in the credit markets due to the economic environment, concerns about the offshore drilling industry and our credit ratings may restrict our access to the credit and debt capital markets in the future and increase the cost of such indebtedness. As a result, our future cash flows and access to capital may be insufficient to meet all of our capital requirements, debt obligations and contractual commitments, and any insufficiency could have an adverse impact on our business.\nCertain credit rating agencies have downgraded our credit ratings below investment grade and may further downgrade our credit ratings at any time. A further downgrade in our ratings could have adverse consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following:\n\u2022\nRestrict our ability to access credit and debt capital markets;\n\u2022\nCause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions;\n\u2022\nNegatively impact current and prospective customers\u2019 willingness to transact business with us;\n\u2022\nImpose additional insurance, guarantee and collateral requirements; or\n\u2022\nLimit our access to bank and third-party guarantees, surety bonds and letters of credit.\nTechnology disputes could negatively impact our operations or increase our costs.\nDrilling rigs use proprietary technology and equipment which can involve potential infringement of a third party\u2019s rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our jack-ups and drillships are owned by us or our suppliers or sub-suppliers, however, in the event that we or one of our suppliers or sub-suppliers becomes involved in a dispute over infringement rights relating to equipment owned or used by us, we may lose access to repair services or replacement parts, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or forced to modify our jack-ups or drillships. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment. Technology disputes involving us, or our suppliers or sub-suppliers could adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nUnionization efforts and labor regulations in certain countries in which we operate could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nCertain of our employees and contractors in various regions such as Trinidad and Norway are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation. Further, efforts may be made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce. In addition, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs, reduce our revenue or limit our operations.\nSupplier capacity constraints or shortages in parts or equipment, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenue and adversely impact our operations.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment used in our drilling operations could expose us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain specialized parts and equipment we use in our operations may be available only from a single or small number of suppliers. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, defects or quality-control issues, recalls or other decreased availability or servicing of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers, adversely impact our operations and revenue by resulting in uncompensated downtime, reduced day rates or the cancellation or termination of contracts, or increase our operating costs. Our reliance on one or more of these third-party suppliers could further exacerbate such issues.\nThe enforcement of civil liabilities against Rowan plc may be more difficult.\nBecause Rowan plc is a public limited company incorporated under English law, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against Rowan plc in U.S. courts than would be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S.\ncompany. In addition, it may be more difficult to bring some types of claims against Rowan plc in courts in the U.K. than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.\nOur articles of association include mandatory offer provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing hostile takeovers, including those that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our shares, and discouraging, delaying or preventing changes in control or management.\nAlthough Rowan plc is not currently subject to the U.K. Takeover Code, certain provisions similar to the mandatory offer provisions and certain other aspects of the U.K. Takeover Code are included in our articles of association. As a result, among other matters, a Rowan plc shareholder, that together with persons acting in concert, acquired 30 percent or more of our issued shares without making an offer to all of our other shareholders that is in cash or accompanied by a cash alternative would be at risk of certain Board sanctions unless they acted with the consent of our Board or the prior approval of the shareholders. The ability of shareholders to retain their shares upon completion of a mandatory offer may depend on whether the offeror subsequently causes us to propose a court-approved scheme of arrangement that would compel minority shareholders to transfer or surrender their shares in favor of the offeror or, if the offeror has acquired at least 90 percent of the relevant shares, the offeror requires minority shareholders to accept the offer under the \u2018squeeze-out\u2019 provisions in our articles of association. The mandatory offer provisions in our articles of association could have the effect of discouraging the acquisition and holding of interests of 30 percent or more of issued shares and encouraging those shareholders who may be acting in concert with respect to the acquisition of shares to seek to obtain the consent of our Board before effecting any additional purchases. In addition, these provisions may adversely affect the market price of our shares or inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could otherwise result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\nAs a result of shareholder approval requirements required under U.K. law, we may have less flexibility than a Delaware corporation with respect to certain aspects of capital management.\nUnlike most U.S. state corporate law, English law provides that a board of directors may generally only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders, which such authorization may only extend for a maximum period of five years. English law also generally provides shareholders preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash unless such rights are waived by the shareholders.\nEnglish law also generally prohibits us from repurchasing our shares on the open market and prohibits us from repurchasing our shares by way of \u201coff-market purchases\u201d without the prior approval of shareholders, which approval may only extend for a maximum period of five years.\nAt our 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders, our Board was authorized to allot a certain amount of shares, exclude certain preemptive rights in shares for cash offerings and effect off market purchases, in each case without further shareholder approval. However, these authorizations expire in May 2019. As such, we will be unable to issue new shares or repurchase shares unless and until we receive renewed shareholder approval. In addition, even if approved by shareholders, our ability to issue and repurchase shares may be substantially more restricted than a U.S. company.\nEnglish law requires that we meet certain additional financial requirements before we declare dividends and return funds to shareholders.\nUnder English law, a public company may only declare dividends and make other distributions to shareholders (such as a share buyback) if the company has sufficient distributable reserves and meets certain net asset requirements. If we do not have sufficient distributable reserves or cannot meet the net asset requirements, we may be limited in our ability to timely pay dividends and effect other distributions to our shareholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected by the actions of activist shareholders.\nCertain of our shareholders may from time to time advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our business. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders could disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause customer and employee concerns, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Such perceived uncertainties could negatively affect the trading price and volatility of our common stock.\nThe U.K.\u2019s referendum to exit from the E.U. will have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as Brexit). The terms of Brexit and the resulting U.K./E.U. relationship are uncertain for companies doing business both in the U.K. and the overall global economy. In addition, our business and operations may be impacted by any subsequent vote in Scotland to seek independence from the U.K. Risks related to Brexit that we may encounter include:\n\u2022\nadverse impact on macroeconomic growth and oil and gas demand;\n\u2022\ncontinued volatility in currencies including the British pound and USD that may impact our financial results;\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our services in the U.K. and globally;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of doing business in the U.K. and in the North Sea;\n\u2022\nuncertain impact of regulatory changes arising from an exit from the E.U.;\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory costs and challenges for operating our business in the North Sea;\n\u2022\nvolatile capital and debt markets, and access to other sources of capital;\n\u2022\nrisks related to our global tax structure and the tax treaties upon which we rely;\n\u2022\nbusiness uncertainty resulting from prolonged political negotiations; and\n\u2022\nuncertain stability of the E.U. and global economy if other countries exit the E.U.\nWe and Ensco will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Transaction is pending that could adversely affect each party's business and operations.\nIn connection with the proposed Transaction, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we or Ensco have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions, or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us or Ensco as a result of the Transaction, which could negatively affect our or Ensco\u2019s respective financial positions, operating results or cash flows, as well as the market price of our shares and Ensco\u2019s shares, regardless of whether the Transaction is completed.\nUnder the terms of the Transaction Agreement, we and Ensco are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completing the Transaction, which may adversely affect our and Ensco\u2019s ability to execute certain business strategies. Such limitations could negatively affect each party\u2019s businesses and operations prior to the completion of the Transaction. Furthermore, the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the post-transaction period may divert management\u2019s attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on each party. These uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us or Ensco to seek to change existing business relationships with such party, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.\nWe or Ensco may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the Transaction.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Transaction on our employees or Ensco\u2019s employees may impair the companies' ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the Transaction is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Transaction, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles with the combined organization. In addition, we or Ensco may have to provide additional compensation in order to retain employees. If our employees or Ensco\u2019s employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become employees of the combined company, the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction could be adversely affected.\nThe Transaction is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Transaction, or significant delays in completing the Transaction, could negatively affect the trading price of our shares and our future business and financial results.\nThe completion of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions beyond our and Ensco\u2019s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion, including the approval of governmental agencies. Neither we nor Ensco can predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied.\nIf the Transaction is not completed, we will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\ncertain damages for which we may be liable to Ensco under the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement;\n\u2022\nnegative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the price of our shares due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the Transaction will be completed;\n\u2022\ncertain significant costs relating to the Transaction, including, in certain circumstances, the payment by us of $15 million for Ensco\u2019s expenses and a termination fee payable by us of $24 million less any previous expense reimbursements; and\n\u2022\ndiverted attention of our management to the Transaction rather than our own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.\nWe and Ensco will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Transaction.\nWe and Ensco expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Transaction, combining the operations of the two organizations and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs will be substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial, accounting and other advisors, retention, severance and other integration-related costs, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business and Ensco\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.\nIf completed, the Transaction may not achieve its intended results, and we and Ensco may be unable to successfully integrate our operations. Failure to successfully combine our business and Ensco\u2019s business in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined organization and, consequently, the value of Ensco's shares that our shareholders receive as the Transaction consideration.\nWe and Ensco entered into the Transaction Agreement with the expectation that the Transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, expanding our geographic presence and customer base and creating synergies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of us and Ensco can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Because our shares are being exchanged for Ensco's shares in the Transaction, our stock price may be adversely affected by a decline in Ensco's stock price and any adverse developments in\nEnsco's business, either of which may result from a variety of factors beyond our control.\nIt is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect the combined company's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction. The combined company's results of operations could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either company's operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur prior to the completion of the Transaction. The companies may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect the combined company's future business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nA downgrade in our or our subsidiaries\u2019 credit ratings following the Transaction could impact the combined entity\u2019s access to capital and cost of doing business.\nFollowing the Transaction, rating agencies may re-evaluate our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated downgrades in such credit ratings could limit our ability to access credit and capital markets, or to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. As a result of any such downgrades, future financings or refinancings may result in higher borrowing costs and require more restrictive terms and covenants, including obligations to post collateral with third parties, which may further restrict operations and negatively impact liquidity.\nCredit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the rated entity. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current credit ratings.\nCompletion of the Transaction will trigger change of control or other provisions in certain agreements to which we are a party.\nThe completion of the Transaction will trigger change of control or other provisions in certain agreements to which we are a party. In particular, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2025 Notes, the combined company will be required to make an offer to purchase all of each holder\u2019s notes at an amount equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such holder\u2019s notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, if there is a ratings downgrade by both Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody's\") and S&P Global Rating (\"S&P\") between the public notice of the Transaction and 60 days after the consummation of the Transaction (or any extended period if either Moody's or S&P publicly announces a possible downgrade). As a result, the combined company could be required to repay up to an aggregate $500 million principal amount of senior notes plus approximately $5 million in associated premiums.\nIn addition, the completion of the Transaction will constitute a change of control under the Existing Credit Facility and the New Credit Facility. As a result, the commitments will be terminated and the outstanding balances under each of the Existing Credit Facility and the New Credit Facility will be accelerated and become due and payable by us in connection with the completion of the Transaction. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under either the Existing Credit Facility and the New Credit Facility.\nIf a governmental authority asserts objections to the Transaction, we and Ensco may be unable to complete the Transaction or, in order to do so, we and Ensco may be required to comply with material restrictions or satisfy material conditions.\nThe completion of the Transaction is subject to the condition that there is no order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint by a governmental authority in effect restraining, preventing or prohibiting the Transaction contemplated by the Transaction Agreement. If a governmental authority asserts objections to the Transaction, we or Ensco may be required to divest assets or accept other remedies in order to complete the Transaction. There can be no assurance as to the cost, scope or impact of the actions that may be required to address any governmental authority objections to the Transaction. If we or Ensco takes such actions, it could be detrimental to us or to the combined company following the consummation of the Transaction. Furthermore, these actions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Transaction or imposing additional costs on or limiting the operating results or cash flows of the combined company following the consummation of the Transaction.\nIn addition, in some circumstances, a third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the Transaction, before or after it is completed. We or Ensco may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.\nThe Transaction may be completed even though material adverse changes subsequent to the announcement of the Transaction, such as industry-wide changes or other events, may occur.\nIn general, either party can refuse to complete the Transaction if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party. However, some types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Transaction, even if such changes would have a material adverse effect on either of the parties. For example, a worsening of our or Ensco\u2019s financial condition or results of operations due to a decrease in commodity prices or general economic conditions would not give the other party the right to refuse to complete the Transaction. If adverse changes occur that affect either party but the parties are still required to complete the Transaction, our share price, business and financial results after the Transaction may suffer.", "PERMNO": 45495, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "RDC"}
