RISK FACTORS\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nWe are dependent on Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd. and on four other customers for a large portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders in any period from any of these major customers may reduce our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe telecommunications systems market is concentrated with approximately ten global network equipment manufacturing companies having collectively more than 90% market share. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., together with its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd. (collectively \u201cHuawei\u201d) accounted for approximately 41%, 46% and 40% of our revenue, respectively. Revenue generated from one other customer in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was greater than 10% of our revenue. We have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our top five customers represented 84%, 87%, and 78% of our revenue respectively. The loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of these major customers would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability, impair our ability to compete in international markets, or restrict our sales to certain customers. In particular, U.S. governmental export control actions have impacted our sales to Huawei, which has had (and may continue to have) a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to export and import control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products. In some cases, it is possible that export licenses would be required from the U.S. or other government agencies outside the U.S. such as, but not limited to, Japan or China for some of our products in accordance with various statutes or regulations. In addition, various countries regulate the export or import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis, or at all, or any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products or to obtain any required licenses would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn May 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, added Huawei and certain affiliates to the BIS Entity List (\"Entity List\"). Absent a license, this action prevents Huawei from purchasing products, software and technology that are subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). To ensure compliance, we immediately suspended shipments to Huawei and began a systematic assessment of our products sold to Huawei to determine\nhow these products are, or are not, subject to the restrictions resulting from the Entity List. This suspension had an immediate impact on our products shipments to Huawei in the second quarter of 2019, which significantly affected our revenue for the second quarter and the remainder of 2019. We have consulted closely with legal and technical experts, in order to determine which of our products and associated technology, notably our foreign-manufactured products, are not subject to EAR or have de minimis content subject to EAR and may be lawfully sold to Huawei and its affiliates. Each product and associated technology must be reviewed individually in a detailed, specific and time consuming process. Consequently, we have reset our business approach with and shipments to Huawei to consist of only products that have been determined to be not subject to the EAR regulations or that have de minimis content subject to EAR regulations.\nOn or shortly after June 29, 2019, U.S. government officials allowed companies to apply for temporary export licenses for products subject to EAR and that these licenses might be granted if the product was deemed not to be a risk to national security. We have submitted license applications for certain products and associated technology having elements subject to EAR; to date, we have received a license for limited, but not material, volumes of U.S. origin lasers. There can be no assurance as to which products or technology may qualify for a license, or that any such licenses will be granted in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will not challenge our determination of which products and associated technology are not subject to the EAR regulations.\nEven if licenses are obtained, or if the EAR restrictions are lifted or modified to allow us to sell the same types of products we have sold historically, Huawei may decide not to purchase these products for various reasons, including to reduce its own risks of being exposed to disruptions of its supply chain.\nA significant reduction in orders from Huawei as a result of these U.S. export control actions would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share.\nThe communications networks industry is highly competitive. Our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in niche products.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater name brand recognition, technical, financial, and marketing resources, and greater manufacturing capacity, as well as better-established relationships with customers, than we do. Some of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire, and more experience in developing or acquiring, new products and technologies. Some of our competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or which provide more functionality than ours. In addition, some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at below-market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively and result in a loss of sales or market share or cause us to lower prices for our products.\nWe also face competition from some of our customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally, including Huawei. Due to the fact that such customers are not seeking to make a comparable profit directly from the manufacture of these products or for other reasons, they may have the ability to provide competitive products at a lower total cost than we would charge such customers. As a result, these customers may purchase less of our products and there would be additional pressure to lower our selling prices which, accordingly, would negatively impact our revenue and gross margin.\nIn December 2017, the Chinese Government Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced a five-year optical component technology roadmap with the aim to reduce China\u2019s dependency on non-domestic companies for high-end optical chips and sub-components, including some products manufactured and sold by us. This announcement continues an ongoing trend in China to build domestic industry in this area and, while we believe local Chinese component suppliers do not currently have the capability to supply the highest performance optical chips and sub-components, those companies may over time develop such capability and negatively impact our revenue and financial performance if we do not continue to innovate and maintain our lead in the highest speed and performance optical components. This trend may accelerate as a result of the current Huawei listing on the Entity List and U.S.-China trade tensions.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our revenue growth outlook in China.\nFiber optics telecommunication growth in China is an important contributor to our success. We expect a major portion of our revenue to come from companies supporting China infrastructure spending in wireline and wireless networks, notably from the three largest China telecom carriers, China Mobile Communications Corporation, China Telecommunications Corporation and China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd. If the anticipated Chinese spending and carrier tender\nawards do not increase as anticipated, or if there are further unanticipated and/or prolonged delays in the Chinese initiative, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be further adversely affected.\nContinued tension in U.S.-China trade relations may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nBeyond the BIS actions affecting our sales to Huawei, the U.S. government has taken certain actions that change U.S. trade policies, including recently-imposed tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in China. Some products manufactured by our Chinese affiliates are subject to tariffs if imported into the United States. In addition, the China government has taken certain reciprocal actions, including recently imposed tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in the United States. Certain of our products manufactured in our U.S. operations have been included in the tariffs imposed on imports into China from the United States. Going forward, we expect these tariffs, as currently applied, will increase our cost of goods sold by about one percentage point for as long as the tariffs remain in place. It is unknown whether and to what extent additional new tariffs (or other new laws or regulations) will be adopted that increase the cost of importing products to or from the United States, or from China to the United States. Further, it is unknown what effect that any such new tariffs or retaliatory actions would have on us or our industry and customers. As additional new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if China or other affected countries take retaliatory trade actions, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNatural disasters, major health events, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations and our financial results.\nOur worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters, major health events and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, our corporate headquarters and wafer fabrication facility in Silicon Valley, California and our Tokyo, Japan facility are located near major earthquake fault lines, and our manufacturing facilities are located in Shenzhen and Dongguan, China, areas that are susceptible to typhoons. Our operations in China, as well as our R&D center in Wuhan, could be impacted by the novel coronavirus. We are not insured against many natural disasters, including earthquakes, or against major public health events.\nSimilarly, our worldwide operations could be subject to secondary effects of natural disasters, major health events or other catastrophic events. Even if our facilities are not directly affected, any of these types of events could substantially disrupt the business of our suppliers or customers, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the country. This has affected our manufacturing facilities in China as well as the facilities of our suppliers and customers. The extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in order to pursue our business strategies or maintain our operations, and we may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash flows from our operating activities and funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we operate in an industry that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. If this occurs, we may need additional financing to continue operations or execute on our current or future business strategies, including to:\n\u2022\ninvest in our research and development efforts, including by hiring additional technical and other personnel;\n\u2022\nmaintain and expand our operating or manufacturing infrastructure;\n\u2022\nacquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies; or\n\u2022\notherwise pursue our strategic plans and respond to competitive pressures.\nWe do not know with certainty what forms of financing, if any, will be available to us. If financing is not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, enhance our research and development and sales and marketing functions, develop and enhance our products, respond to unanticipated events, including unanticipated opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be adversely impacted.\nIf we incur additional indebtedness through arrangements such as credit agreements or term loans, such arrangements may impose restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to respond appropriately to market conditions, make capital investments or take advantage of business opportunities. In addition, any additional debt arrangements we may enter into would likely require us to make regular interest payments, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur future results of operations may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and Japanese Yen (JPY) exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks. Foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenue and our costs and expenses, and hence our results of operations. A substantial portion of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries based in China, whose functional currency is the RMB and Japan, whose functional currency is the JPY. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies and the value of the JPY against the U.S. dollar and other currencies fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions.\nTo the extent that transactions by our subsidiaries in China and Japan are denominated in currencies other than the RMB and JPY, we bear the risk that fluctuations in the exchange rates of the RMB and JPY in relation to other currencies could decrease our revenue or increase our costs and expenses, therefore having an adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nWhile we generate a significant portion of our revenue in U.S dollars, a significant portion of our cost of goods sold are in RMB and JPY. Therefore appreciation in RMB and JPY against the U.S. dollar would negatively impact our cost of goods sold upon translation to U.S. dollars.\nFrom mid-2016 to mid-2018, we entered into hedging transactions to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations. During the second half of 2018, we discontinued entering into foreign currency forward contracts. This may increase the risks to us arising from the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations. If we resume using hedging transactions to reduce our risks in this area, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure. In addition, our currency exchange variations may be magnified by Chinese exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency.\nManufacturing problems and supply constraints could impact manufacturing yields or result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue, competitive position and reputation.\nWe may experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or supply chain constraints, which could adversely impact manufacturing volumes, yields or delay product shipments. As a result, we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross margin, and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue, competitive position and reputation.\nAdditionally, manufacturing of new products and manufacturing yields more generally depend on a number of factors, including the stability and manufacturability of the product design, manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes, the quality and consistency of component parts and the nature and extent of customization requirements by customers. Capacity constraints, raw materials shortages, logistics issues, labor shortages, volatility in utilization of manufacturing operations, supporting utility services and other manufacturing supplies, the introduction of new product lines, rapid increases in production demands and changes in customer requirements, manufacturing facilities or processes, or those of some third party contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components have historically caused, and may in the future cause, reduced manufacturing yields, negatively impacting the gross margin on, and our production capacity for, those products.\nOur ability to maintain sufficient manufacturing yields is particularly challenging with respect to PICs due to the complexity and required precision of a large number of unique manufacturing process steps. Manufacturing yields for PICs can also suffer if contaminated materials or materials that do not meet highly precise composition requirements are inadvertently utilized. Because a large portion of our PIC manufacturing costs are fixed, PIC manufacturing yields can have a substantial effect on our gross margin. Lower than expected manufacturing yields could also delay product shipments and decrease our revenue.\nFurther, our products contain purchased components including electronic components. It is possible that such purchased items could contain quality defects, manufacturing defects, performance problems or even counterfeit substitutes,\neach of which could result in manufacturing issues. As a result, we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross margin, and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue, competitive position and reputation.\nCustomer demand is difficult to accurately forecast and, as a result, we may be unable to optimally match production with customer demand.\nWe make planning and spending decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers, and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products, reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. A sudden reduction in customer demand due to market downturns or other reasons would have a material adverse effect on our operating results, as occurred in 2017, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed.\nOn the other hand, on occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, cause our manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages, necessitate higher or more restrictive procurement commitments, increase our manufacturing yield loss and scrapping of excess materials, result in delayed shipments and/or reduce our gross margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our customers, and we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing operations on a timely basis to meet increasing customer demand. Additionally, one or more of our suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. Any inability to meet customer demands for rapid increases in production in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our gross margins.\nThe communications networks industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time as technological advances increase price and performance and put pressure on existing products. We have reduced the prices of many of our products in the past, most often during annual end-of-year price negotiation. We expect pricing pressure for our products to continue, including from our major customers. To maintain or increase their market share, our competitors also reduce prices of their products each year. In addition, our customers may seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge, which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices. If we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume, reducing our costs or introducing new products, our gross margin would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth and our business could suffer.\nOur success and ability to implement our business strategy depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and others, including senior management in foreign subsidiaries and our technical and operations employees in all locations. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our senior management and others. The loss of services of members of our senior management team or key personnel or the inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Competition for highly skilled technical and operations people where we operate is extremely intense, and we continue to face challenges identifying, hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business.\nWe have had a history of losses which may recur in the future.\nWe have had a history of losses and we may incur additional losses in future periods. As of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was $414.5 million. We continue to review our expenditures related to the ongoing operations of our business for their effectiveness. These include expenditures related to the sales, marketing and development of our products and to maintain our manufacturing facilities and research and development operations. Operations and assets that are deemed to be less effective may be subject to restructuring, which could lead to increased operating losses in future periods when and if restructuring charges are incurred.\nWe depend upon outside contract manufacturers for a portion of the manufacturing process for some of our products. Our operations and revenue related to these products could be adversely affected if we encounter problems with any such contract manufacturer.\nWhile many of our products are manufactured internally, we also rely upon contract manufacturers in Thailand, China, Japan and other Asia locations to provide back-end manufacturing and production of some of our products. Our reliance on contract manufacturers for some of our products makes us vulnerable to possible production capacity constraints, reduced control over their supply chains, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, manufacturing quality/controls and costs. If one of our contract manufacturers is unable to meet all of our customer demand in a timely fashion, whether due to their direct operating control or due to their supply chain, this could have a material adverse effect on the revenue from our products.\nThe majority of our customer contracts do not commit customers to specified buying levels, and many of our customers may decrease, cancel or delay their buying levels at any time with little or no advance notice to us.\nOur products are typically sold pursuant to individual purchase orders or by use of a vendor-managed inventory, or VMI, model, which is a process by which we ship agreed quantities of products to a customer-designated location and those products remain our inventory and we retain the title and risk of loss for those products until the customer takes possession of the products. Our customers are typically not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place, which may impact our level of business.\nWe may be exposed to costs or losses from product lines that we intend to exit or may undertake divestiture of portions of our business that require us to continue providing substantial post-divestiture transition services and support, which may cause us to incur unanticipated costs and liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a strategy to exit products that have been declining in revenue and have lower gross margins than our other higher speed products. For instance, in January 2017, we completed the sale of assets and transfer of certain liabilities of our access network and low speed transceiver product lines (the \u201cLow Speed Transceiver Products\u201d) and in January 2019 we announced the end-of-life of certain client transceiver modules and discontinued the manufacture and sale of those products after completing final production in May 2019. We may incur additional costs in connection with the sale or end-of-life of these products, or other products and/or facilities in the future, and our revenues and net income could be negatively affected, particularly in the short term, in connection with the end-of-life or sales of such products and/or facilities. It is also possible that we could incur continued costs or liabilities after the end-of-life process is completed, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nSpending for communications networks is cyclical in nature, and any future downturn may reduce demand for our products and revenue.\nOur future success as a provider of components, modules and subsystems to leading network equipment vendors depends on continued capital spending on global communications networks. Network traffic has experienced rapid growth driven primarily by bandwidth-intensive content, including cloud services, mobile video and data services, wireless 4G/LTE and now 5G services, social networking, video conferencing and other multimedia. This growth is intensified by the proliferation of fixed and wireless devices that are enabling consumers to access content at increasing data rates anytime and anywhere. Our future success depends on continued demand for high-bandwidth, high-speed communications networks and the ability of network equipment vendors and carrier data center operators to fulfill this demand. While we believe the long term prospects for growth in data traffic remain strong, especially in Cloud and data center markets, our business and financial results will suffer if growth does not occur as expected.\nThe markets for communications networks may be cyclical and characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving standards and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. In the past, including recently to varying degrees in China, the U.S. and Europe, these markets have experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, the maturation of product cycles for both manufacturers\u2019 and their customers\u2019 products or in response to over or under purchasing of inventory by our customers relative to ultimate carrier demand, and with declining general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Our historical results of operations have been subject to substantial fluctuations as a result of market downturns and changes in capital spending, and we may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future results of operations.\nOur solutions for the Cloud and data center market segments may not achieve broader market acceptance, which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share.\nPart of our overall strategy is to continue to expand our optoelectronic solutions for the highest speed Cloud and data center market segments. If we fail to achieve broader acceptance of our products in the Cloud and data center markets, there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue, gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability. Our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to produce optoelectronic solutions for 100G to 800G and beyond that compete favorably against other solutions on the basis of price, quality, reliability and performance;\n\u2022\nour ability to timely introduce and complete new designs and timely qualify and certify our products;\n\u2022\nwhether major Cloud and hyper-scale data center operators will adopt our solutions, which are based on a new network architecture and have a limited history in these market segments;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop products that comply with applicable standards and regulatory requirements, as well as potential in-country manufacturing requirements; and;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and maintain successful relationships with our customers and suppliers.\nIf the Cloud and data center market segments fail to grow as expected, or if demand for our solutions in these segments fails to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would suffer.\nRisks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales in various markets, and we have substantial operations in China, Japan and Thailand in addition to the U.S. Our international revenue and operations are subject to a number of material risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing, managing and supporting operations across different jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nfewer legal protections for intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ninternational trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining any necessary governmental authorizations for the export of our products to certain foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nimposition of export restrictions on sales to any of our major foreign customers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign economies and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;\n\u2022\nmajor health events, such as outbreaks of contagious disease;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic or political changes, hostilities and other disruptions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and trade standards, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international labor standards.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in China, Japan, Thailand or other countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difficulties in producing and delivering our products, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, higher labor costs and a higher cost of doing business.\nIn addition, although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur revenues and costs will fluctuate over time, making it difficult to predict our gross margins and future results of operations.\nOur revenue, gross margin and results of operations have varied significantly and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. We may not be able to maintain or\nimprove our gross margins because of slow introductions of new products, pricing pressure from increased competition, failure to effectively reduce the cost of existing products, failure to improve our product mix, future macroeconomic or market volatility reducing sales volumes, changes in customer demand (including a change in product mix among different areas of our business) or other factors. Our gross margins can also be adversely affected for reasons including, but not limited to, fixed manufacturing costs that would not be expected to decrease in proportion to any decrease in revenues; unfavorable production yields or variances; increases in costs of input parts and materials; the timing of movements in our inventory balances; warranty costs and related returns; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; possible exposure to inventory valuation reserves; and other increases in our costs and expenses, including as a result of rising labor costs in China. Such significant increases in costs without corresponding increases in revenue would materially and adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition and our gross margins.\nOur revenues are typically subject to seasonality.\nOur first quarter revenue is typically seasonally lower than the rest of the year primarily due to annual price negotiations with customers that occur at the end of the prior year and lower capacity utilization during the annual new year holidays in China. This historical pattern typically adversely affects our revenues in the first quarter of each year and impacts the typical annual distribution of revenue from quarter to quarter through the year. That said, our first quarter revenue varies markedly year to year so should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. In 2020, this seasonality may be even higher due to the China central government extending the annual new year holidays in China in an effort to contain impact of the novel coronavirus.\nIf our customers do not qualify our products for use, then our results of operations may suffer.\nPrior to placing volume purchase orders with us, most of our customers require us to obtain their approval called qualification in our industry of our new and existing products, and our customers often audit our manufacturing facilities and perform other vendor evaluations during this process. The qualification process involves product sampling and reliability testing and collaboration with our product management and engineering teams in the design and manufacturing stages. If we are unable to qualify our products with customers, then our revenue would be lower than expected and we may not be able to recover the costs associated with the qualification process which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, due to evolving technological changes in our markets, a customer may cancel or modify a design project before we have qualified our product or begun volume manufacturing of a qualified product. It is unlikely that we would be able to recover the expenses for cancelled or unutilized custom design projects.\nCovenants in our borrowing arrangements may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions.\nWe have lending arrangements with several financial institutions, which generally require us to maintain certain financial covenants and limit our ability to take certain actions such as incurring some kinds of additional debt, paying dividends, or engaging in certain transactions like mergers and acquisitions, investments and asset sales without the lenders\u2019 consent. These restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities, competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions. In addition, a breach of any of these covenants, or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the acceleration of our indebtedness.\nWe may be involved in intellectual property disputes, which could divert management\u2019s attention, cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology.\nParticipants in the markets in which we sell our products have experienced frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous patents in these industries are held by others, including our competitors. In addition, from time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be time consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us, whether or not such claims are valid. While we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon intellectual property rights of other parties and/or meritorious defense would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, we cannot be certain that our products would not be found infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nIn January 2010, Finisar Corporation, or Finisar (which was acquired by II-VI, Inc. in September 2019), filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and three other co-defendants. In the complaint, Finisar alleged infringement of certain of its U.S. patents arising from the co-defendants\u2019 respective manufacture, importation, use, sale of or offer to sell certain optical transceiver products in the U.S. In March 2010, we filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims, asserting two claims of patent infringement and additional claims asserting that Finisar has violated state and federal competition laws and violated its obligations to license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. In May 2010, the Court dismissed without prejudice all co-defendants (including us) except Source Photonics, Inc., on grounds that such claims should have been asserted in four separate lawsuits, one against each co-defendant. This dismissal without prejudice does not prevent Finisar/II-VI from bringing a new similar lawsuit against us. In May 2012, we and Finisar agreed to toll our respective claims until the refiling of certain of the previously asserted claims from this dispute. As a result, Finisar/II-VI is permitted to bring a new lawsuit against us if it chooses to do so, and we may bring new claims against Finisar upon seven days written notice prior to filing such claims.\nAlthough we believe that we would have meritorious defenses to the infringement allegations and intend to defend any new similar lawsuit vigorously, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense. Even if we are successful, we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs in defending the lawsuit. Further, a new lawsuit, if brought by either party, would be likely to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patent registrations in the U.S. and in other foreign countries, some of which have been issued. We cannot guarantee that our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities.\nSimilarly we must protect all company data as it pertains to customers, products and product designs, technology and technology related trade secrets, plus customer and supplier and personal data of suppliers, customers and personnel. We rely on a combination of these important data elements to establish and protect multiple aspects of our business, and loss of data, breaching of data or stealing of such data could hard the company.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation, unauthorized use or other infringement of our intellectual property rights. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protections, and where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as U.S. or Japan law. Particularly, our U.S. patents do not afford any intellectual property protection in China, Japan, Canada, Russia or other Asia locations.\nIn the future, we may need to take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed or misappropriated, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner, customer and employee personal data. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIt could be discovered that our products contain defects that may cause us to incur significant costs, divert our attention, result in a loss of customers and result in product liability claims.\nOur products are complex and undergo quality testing as well as formal qualification, both by our customers and by us. For various reasons, such as the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty components or design, problems in manufacturing or other unforeseen reasons. As a result, we could incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. Any significant product failure could result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products, as well as customer relations problems and litigation, which could harm our business.\nFurther, our products contain purchased components including electronic components. It is possible that such purchased items could contain quality defects, manufacturing defects, performance problems or even counterfeit substitutes. Any significant product failure that is the result of such defects could result in lost future sales as well as customer relations problems and litigation, which could harm our business.\nThe communications networks industry has long product development cycles requiring us to incur product development costs without assurances of an acceptable investment return.\nLarge volumes of communications equipment and support structures are installed with considerable expenditures of funds and other resources, and long investment return period expectations. At the component supplier level, these cycles create considerable, typically multi-year, gaps between the commencement of new product development and volume purchases. Due to changing industry and customer requirements, we are constantly developing new products, including seeking to further integrate functions on PICs and developing and using new technologies in our products. These development activities necessitate significant investment of capital. Our new products often require a long time to develop because of their complexity and rigorous testing and qualification requirements. Accordingly, we and our competitors often incur significant research and development and sales and marketing costs for products that, initially, will be purchased by our customers long after much of the cost is incurred and, in some cases, may never be purchased due to changes in industry or customer requirements in the interim.\nIf we fail to obtain the right to use the intellectual property rights of others which are necessary to operate our business, and to protect their intellectual property, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time we may choose to, or be required to, license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products. Failure to obtain a necessary third-party license required for our product offerings or to develop new products and product enhancements could adversely affect our business.\nSimilarly from time to time others may endeavor to infringe on our intellectual property or encroach on our trademarks or other intellectual property. Our failure to identify, recognize and/or action to product such intellectual property could adversely affect our business.\nParticipation in standards setting organizations may subject us to intellectual property licensing requirements or limitations that could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nIn the course of our participation in the development of emerging standards for some of our present and future products, we may agree to grant to all other participants a license to our patents that are essential to the practice of those standards on reasonable and non-discriminatory, or RAND, terms. If we fail to limit to whom we license our patents, or fail to limit the terms of any such licenses, we may be required to license our patents or other intellectual property to others in the future, which could limit the effectiveness of our patents against competitors.\nAny potential dispute involving our products, services or technology could also include our customers using our products, which could trigger our indemnification obligations to them and result in substantial expenses to us.\nIn any potential dispute involving allegations that our products, services or technology infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our customers could also become the target of litigation. Because we often indemnify our customers for intellectual property claims made against them for products incorporating our technology, any claims against our customers could trigger indemnification obligations in some of our supply agreements, which could result in substantial expenses such as increased legal expenses, product recalls, damages for past infringement or royalties for future use.\nRapidly changing standards and regulations could make our products obsolete, which would cause our revenue and results of operations to suffer.\nWe design our products to conform to regulations established by governments and to standards set by industry standards bodies worldwide, such as The American National Standards Institute, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the International Telecommunications Union and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Various industry organizations are currently considering whether and to what extent to create standards for elements used in 100Gbps and beyond systems. Because certain of our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards, if competing or new standards emerge that are preferred by our customers, we would have to make significant expenditures to develop new products and our revenue and results of operations would suffer.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.\nPreparing our consolidated financial statements involves a number of complex manual and automated processes, which are dependent upon individual data input or review and require significant management judgment. One or more of these elements may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, our business and operating results may be harmed and we may fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. If material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any failure of our internal controls could adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock may decline.\nWe may be unable to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our income taxes, which could adversely affect our future financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for U.S. federal and state tax purposes of $290.4 million and $52.1 million, respectively. As these net operating losses have not been utilized and may not be utilized prior to their expiration in the future. The utilization of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to a substantial limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions. We recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, for the NOL carryforwards currently available after considering the existing Section 382 limitation. If we incur an additional limitation under Section 382, then the NOL carryforwards, as disclosed, could be reduced by the impact of any future limitation that would result in existing NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards expiring unutilized and increases in future tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could subject us to liabilities, increase our costs, or restrict our business or operations in the future.\nOur manufacturing operations and our products are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products. Our failure to comply with present and future environmental, health or safety requirements, or the identification of contamination, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, monetary fines, civil or criminal penalties, or curtailment of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHG, may also impact us. Additional climate change or GHG control requirements are under consideration at the federal level in the U.S. and in China. Additional restrictions, limits, taxes, or other controls on GHG emissions could increase our operating costs and, while it is not possible to\nestimate the specific impact any final GHG regulations will have on our operations, there can be no assurance that these measures will not have significant additional impact on us.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in China\nOur business operations conducted in China are critical to our success. A significant portion of our revenue was recognized from customers for whom we shipped products to a location in China. Additionally, a substantial portion of our net property, plant and equipment, approximately 24% as of December 31, 2019, was located in China. We expect to make further investments in China in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are to a significant degree subject to economic, political, legal, and social events and developments in China.\nAdverse changes in economic and political policies in China, or Chinese laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on business conditions and the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe Chinese government exercises significant control over China\u2019s economy by way of the allocation of resources, control over foreign currency-denominated obligations and monetary policy and provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Moreover, the laws, regulations and legal requirements in China, including the laws that apply to foreign-invested enterprises are relatively new and are subject to frequent changes. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws is uncertain. Any adverse changes to these laws, regulations and legal requirements, including tax laws, or their interpretation or enforcement, or the creation of new laws or regulations relating to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, any slowdown or economic downturn, whether actual or perceived, in China could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nUncertainties with respect to China\u2019s legal system could adversely affect the legal protection available to us.\nOur operations in China are governed by Chinese laws and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. China has not developed a fully-integrated legal system to fully address its transition to a more market-oriented economy, and recently-enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. Uncertainties in the Chinese legal system may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into with our distributors, business partners, customers and suppliers. In addition, protections of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in China may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries or regions with more developed legal systems. All of these uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nChanges in China\u2019s international trade policies may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe China government has recently made statements and taken certain actions that change trade policies, including recently-imposed tariffs affecting products manufactured in the U.S. Certain of our products manufactured in our U.S. operations have been included in the tariffs imposed on imports into China from the United States. We expect these tariffs, as currently applied, will increase our cost of goods sold by approximately one percentage point. It is unknown if any additional such tariffs or retaliatory actions will be imposed or what impact they would have on us or our industry and customers. As new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated between China and the U.S. or other affected countries, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, in response to such trade tensions, the Chinese government and/or individual Chinese customers may take steps to reduce their supply chain dependence on products from U.S. suppliers through their own internal developments or the selection of non U.S. suppliers, placing us at a commercial disadvantage and potentially affecting our business.\nA considerable portion of our business involves selling High Speed optical components in China and any move to local Chinese vendors for these products might adversely affect our results.\nIn December 2017, the Chinese Government Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has announced a five-year optical component technology roadmap with the aim to reduce China\u2019s dependency on non-domestic companies for high-end optical chips and sub-components, including some products manufactured and sold by us. This announcement continues an\nongoing trend in China to build domestic industry in this area. While we believe local Chinese component suppliers do not currently have the capability to supply the highest performance optical chips and sub-components, those companies may over time develop such capability and negatively impact our revenue and financial performance if we do not continue to innovate and maintain our lead in the highest speed and performance optical components.\nOur subsidiaries in China may be subject to restrictions on dividend payments, on making other payments to us or any other affiliated company, and on borrowing or allocating tax losses among our subsidiaries.\nCurrent Chinese regulations permit our subsidiaries in China to pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations, which are different than U.S. accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our subsidiaries in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective\naccumulated profits each year, if any, to fund their statutory common reserves until such reserves have reached at least 50% of their respective registered capital. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Chinese subsidiaries\u2019 common reserves had not reached this threshold and, accordingly, these entities are required to continue funding such reserves with accumulated net profits. Accordingly, we may not be able to move our capital easily, which could harm our business.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use our cash effectively.\nIn China, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, administers restrictions on currency exchange. These restrictions may limit our ability to use cash held in RMB to fund any business activities we may have outside China or to make dividend payments in U.S. dollars. SAFE or other Chinese regulatory authorities may impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB, especially with respect to foreign exchange transactions. If such restrictions are imposed, our ability to adjust our capital structure or engage in foreign exchange transactions may be limited.\nIf the Chinese government determines that we failed to obtain approvals of, or registrations with, the requisite Chinese regulatory authority with respect to our current and past import and export of technologies, or failed to obtain the necessary licenses to file patent applications outside China for inventions made in China, we could be subject to sanctions, which could adversely affect our business.\nChina imposes controls on technology import and export. The term \u201ctechnology import and export\u201d is broadly defined to include, without limitation, the transfer or license of patents, software and know-how, and the provision of services in relation to technology. Depending on the nature of the relevant technology, the import and export of technology to or from China requires either approval by or registration with, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities. Additionally, the Chinese government requires the patent application for any invention made at least in part in China to be filed first in China, then undergo a government secrecy review and obtain a license before such application is filed in other countries.\nIf the Chinese government determines that we failed to follow required procedures and obtain the appropriate license before filing a patent application outside China for an invention made at least in part in China, our China patents on such products may be invalidated, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations.\nChina regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to China entities may delay or prevent us from using our cash proceeds to make loans or additional capital contributions to our China subsidiaries.\nFrom time to time, we may make loans or additional capital contributions to our China subsidiaries. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to our future loans or capital contributions to our China subsidiaries. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to capitalize our China subsidiaries may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business.\nDividends paid to us by our Chinese subsidiaries may be subject to Chinese withholding tax.\nThe Enterprise Income Tax Law and the implementation regulations provide that a 10% withholding tax may apply to dividends payable to investors that are \u201cnon-resident enterprises,\u201d to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within China and in the absence of any tax treaty that may reduce such withholding tax rate.\nOur contractual arrangements with our subsidiaries in China may be subject to audit or challenge by the Chinese tax authorities, and a finding that our subsidiaries in China owe additional taxes could substantially reduce our net income and the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment.\nUnder the applicable laws and regulations in China, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the Chinese tax authorities. We would be subject to adverse tax consequences if the Chinese tax authorities were to determine that the contracts with or between our subsidiaries were not executed on an arm\u2019s length basis, and as a result the Chinese tax authorities could require that our Chinese subsidiaries adjust their taxable income upward for Chinese tax purposes. Such an adjustment could adversely affect us by increasing our tax expenses.\nWe may have difficulty maintaining adequate management, legal and financial controls in China, which we are required to do in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and securities laws, and which could cause a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, the trading price of our common stock and our business.\nOur subsidiaries in China are generally subject to our overall obligations to maintain strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. We may have difficulty hiring and retaining employees in China with experience and expertise relating to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and U.S. public-company reporting requirements. These issues could make it more difficult for us to establish and maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting, which could then result in errors that could cause a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties and we make significant sales in China. China also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to discourage these practices by our employees, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or anti-corruption laws in other countries may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile due to fluctuation of our financial results from quarter-to-quarter and other factors.\nOur quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing, volume and product mix of sales of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing and sales policies, particularly in the first quarter of the year, or changes in the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to design, manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner and that meet customer requirements;\n\u2022\nquality control, yield or other output-related problems in our manufacturing operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to timely obtain adequate quantities of the components used in our products;\n\u2022\nlength and variability of the sales cycles of our products;\n\u2022\nunanticipated increases in costs or expenses; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations in the future. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our internal manufacturing, research and development, sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. Moreover, our results of operations may not meet our announced financial\noutlook or the expectations of research analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other factors beyond our control, such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us.\nThe stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, sovereign debt or liquidity issues, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022\nnot providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.", "PERMNO": 12559, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "NPTN"}
