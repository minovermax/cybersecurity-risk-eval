In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nThe Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the NJDOBI, our chartering authority, by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits, and by the CFPB, with respect to consumer protection laws. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to shareholders, restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares, the classification of our assets and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, compliance and privacy issues, BSA and AML compliance, and approval of merger transactions. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on the Bank, the Company and our operations.\nThe potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders. New laws, regulations, and other legal and regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nIf the bank regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares could be adversely affected.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 544% of Bank total risk-based capital at December 31, 2019, however our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by only 16% during the preceding 36 months.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans we hold, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares would be adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If actual results differ significantly from our assumptions, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Bank regulators also periodically review our loan portfolio, the allowance for loan losses, and our assumptions underlying the determinations we have made regarding the allowance for loan losses, and as a result can require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.\nThe FASB has issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The CECL model may create more volatility in the provision as well as the level of our allowance for loan losses.\nBecause we intend to continue to increase our commercial originations, our credit risk will increase.\nAt December 31, 2019, our portfolio of multi-family, commercial real estate, C&I and construction loans totaled $15.86 billion, or 73.1% of our total loans. We intend to continue to increase our originations of multi-family, commercial real estate, C&I and construction loans, which generally have more risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market, local economy or the management of the business or property. In addition, our commercial borrowers may have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Because we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses because of the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings.\nSignificant portions of our multi-family loan portfolio and commercial real estate portfolio and nearly all of our C&I loan portfolio are unseasoned. It is difficult to judge the future performance of unseasoned loans.\nOur multi-family loan portfolio has increased to $7.81 billion at December 31, 2019 from $6.26 billion at December 31, 2015. Our commercial real estate portfolio has increased to $4.83 billion at December 31, 2019 from $3.83 billion at December 31, 2015. Our C&I loan portfolio has increased to $2.95 billion at December 31, 2019 from $1.04 billion at December 31, 2015. Consequently, a large portion of our multi-family loans and commercial real estate loans and nearly all of our C&I loans are unseasoned. It is difficult to assess the future performance of these recently originated loans because of their relatively limited payment history from which to judge future collectability, especially in the economic environment since 2015. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nWe continue to expand our commercial lending efforts and footprint, which may expose us to increased lending risks and may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nIn an effort to diversify our loan portfolio, we have expanded our commercial lending team to include leveraged lending and equipment finance teams, as well as a healthcare lending team that originate loans nationally. We will continue to explore other markets within commercial lending. These types of loans generally have a higher risk of loss compared to our one- to four-family residential real estate loans and multi-family loans, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, some of our equipment finance portfolio relies on the residual values of the underlying equipment and therefore could be negatively impacted by a change in valuation. Because we are not as experienced with these new loan products and areas, we may incur losses or require additional time and resources for offering and managing such products effectively.\nWe will be required to transition from the use of LIBOR in the future.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The continuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed after 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. The Company has approximately $5.00 billion in financial instruments which are indexed to USD-LIBOR. If LIBOR rates are no longer available and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates, we may incur expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and security holders over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In the interim, we have established a cross-functional team to develop initial transition plans to address potential revisions to documentation, as well as customer management and communication, internal training, financial, operational and risk management implications, and legal and contract management. In addition, we have engaged with our regulators and with industry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for transitioning away from LIBOR.\nOur liabilities reprice faster than our assets and future increases in interest rates will reduce our profits.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe interest income we earn on our assets and the interest expense we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, because market interest rates change over time. In periods of rising and/or flattening interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. An increase in interest rates can also result in decreased prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates may cause increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of our total securities portfolio was $3.89 billion. Unrealized net losses on debt securities available-for-sale are reported as a separate component of equity. To the extent interest rates increase and the value of our available-for-sale portfolio decreases, our stockholders\u2019 equity will be adversely affected.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity using models that estimate net interest income sensitivity and the change in our economic value of equity over a range of interest rate scenarios. The economic value of equity analysis is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. At December 31, 2019, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates increase evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no action to mitigate the effect of such change, the model projects that we would experience a 5.1% or $34.2 million decrease\nin net interest income. In a 200 basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates scenario, the model projects a 10.8% or $400.1 million decrease in economic value of equity.\nA flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nDuring the past several years it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at historically lower levels. A flat yield curve combined with low interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it tends to limit our ability to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs. Sustained periods of time with a flat yield curve coupled with low interest rates, or an inversion of the yield curve, could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and earnings.\nWe may not be able to continue to grow our business, which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur total assets have grown from approximately $20.89 billion at December 31, 2015 to $26.70 billion at December 31, 2019. Our business strategy calls for continued growth. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to successfully attract deposits, identify favorable loan and investment opportunities, acquire other banks and non-bank entities and enhance our market presence. In the event that we do not continue to grow, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to grow successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality, remain in good standing with our regulators, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends. If we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition.\nPublic funds deposits are an important source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits and liquidity position.\nPublic funds deposits are a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At December 31, 2019, $4.89 billion, or 27.4% of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities, predominately domiciled in the state of New Jersey, such as townships, school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and other municipalities, which are collateralized by letters of credit from the FHLB and investment securities. Given our use of these high-average balance public funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our public funds deposits are primarily interest-bearing demand deposit accounts or short-term time deposits and are therefore more sensitive to interest rate risks. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to resort to other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net income.\nPublic funds deposits are an important source of funds for us and legislation concerning a State-chartered bank in New Jersey could challenge our overall strategies and potentially reduce the level of public fund deposits.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $4.89 billion in municipal deposits from various municipalities and other governmental entities. Such deposits are generally used to fund our loans and investments. In addition, the State of New Jersey is considering creating a State Bank, whose purpose would be to promote economic development, commerce, and industry in the State. It intends to permit State funds, including funds from State institutions and any State public source, to be held by the State Bank. Given the degree of our funding reliance on New Jersey-based municipal deposits and the potential lending ability of the proposed State Bank, we are uncertain of the impact this proposal may have on us. The possible loss of public funds on deposit may increase the costs of our funding needs, which could have a negative impact on our net income and negatively impact liquidity. The proposed legislation was first introduced in 2018, and in 2019, the Governor of New Jersey signed an executive order establishing an implementation board to develop criteria for establishing a State Bank. At this time, there is no assurance that a State Bank will be established or what its powers or authority may be.\nWe could be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers due to breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell into the secondary market a portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate. The whole loan sale agreements we enter into in connection with such loan sales require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event there is a breach of any of representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. We have established a reserve for estimated repurchase and indemnification obligations on the residential mortgage loans that we sell. We make various assumptions\nand judgments in determining this reserve. If our assumptions are incorrect, our reserve may not be sufficient to cover losses from repurchase and indemnification obligations related to our residential loans sold. Such event would have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nFHLB funds are an important source of funding for the Company and a reduced level may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe borrow directly from the FHLB and various financial institutions. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are unable to secure alternative funding or need to rely on more expensive funding sources, our operating margins, profitability and liquidity would be negatively impacted.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $82.5 million recorded as goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including declines in the market price of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business, could result in impairments to goodwill. We operate in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If our analysis results in impairment to goodwill, we would be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such change could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA worsening of national or local economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDeteriorating economic or business conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our on-going operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and unemployment levels, particularly in New York and New Jersey given our concentration in this region, may result in greater loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming, criticized and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The majority of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in New York and New Jersey.\nThe performance of our multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolios could be adversely impacted by recent or proposed changes in laws and regulation.\nOn June 14, 2019, the State of New York enacted legislation increasing restrictions on rent increases in a rent-regulated apartment building, including, among other provisions, (i) repealing the \u201cvacancy bonus\u201d and \u201clongevity bonus\u201d, which allowed a property owner to raise rents as much as 20% each time a rental unit became vacant, (ii) eliminating high rent vacancy deregulation and high-income deregulation, which allowed a rental unit to be removed from rent stabilization once it crossed a statutory high-rent threshold and became vacant, or the tenant\u2019s income exceeded the statutory amount in the preceding two years, and (iii) eliminating an exception that allowed a property owner who offered preferential rents to tenants to raise the rent to the full legal rent upon renewal. As a result of this new legislation as well as previously existing laws and regulations, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank, the value of the collateral for our multi-family loans or the future cash flow of such properties could be impaired. It is possible that rental income might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, etc.). In addition, if the cash flow from a collateral property is reduced or constrained, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral for the loan may be impaired.\nOur inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect our earnings.\nWe have expanded our presence throughout our market area and may pursue further expansion through de novo branching or the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income.\nGrowing by acquisition entails integration and certain other risks.\nAlthough we have successfully integrated business acquisitions in recent years, failure to successfully integrate systems subsequent to the completion of any future acquisitions could have a material impact on the operations of the Bank.\nFuture acquisition activity could dilute book value.\nBoth nationally and in our region, the banking industry is undergoing consolidation marked by numerous mergers and acquisitions. From time to time we may be presented with opportunities to acquire institutions and/or bank branches and we may engage in discussions and negotiations. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values, and therefore, may result in the dilution of our book value per share.\nCapital requirements for financial institutions have increased in recent years, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn 2015, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board instituted a new rule which substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. This rule implemented the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe rule included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4% under prior rules); (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital, and resulted in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 10.5%. The required minimum capital conservation buffer increased in annual increments to 2.5% on January 1, 2019, which is the fully phased in conservation buffer. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of these more stringent capital requirements for the Bank and the Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations.\nThe Tax Act had both positive and negative effects on our financial performance. The new legislation resulted in a reduction in our federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, which had a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. However, the new legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions, such as the deduction of FDIC deposit insurance premiums and executive compensation, which partially offset the anticipated increase in net earnings from the lower tax rate. In addition, under ASC 740, Income Taxes, companies are required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. As a result of the lower corporate tax rate, the resulting impact of the re-measurement of the Company\u2019s deferred tax balances was $49.2 million, which was recorded as a tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from the foregoing, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations or in assumptions that we have made, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, and other actions that we may take as a result of the Tax Act. Similarly, the Bank\u2019s customers are likely to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the Tax Act and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole. We are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance.\nWe currently utilize incentive-based payment arrangements with our employees as compensation practices. Potential regulatory changes to this practice could have an impact on our current practices and impact our results of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services and non-bank industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. In addition, we compete with numerous online financial service providers who compete in the new digital fintech marketplace and who may not be subject to our regulatory requirements. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger bank and non-bank competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources\nand deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. For additional information see \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nAny future increase in FDIC insurance premiums will adversely impact our earnings.\nAs a \u201clarge institution\u201d within the meaning of FDIC regulations (i.e., greater than $10 billion in assets), the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premium is determined differently than smaller banks. Small banks are assessed based on a risk classification determined by examination ratings, financial ratios and certain specified adjustments. Large institutions are subject to assessment based upon a more detailed scorecard approach involving (i) a performance score determined using forward-looking risk measures, including certain stress testing, and (ii) a loss severity score, which is designed to measure, based on modeling, potential loss to the FDIC insurance fund if the institution failed. The total score is converted to an assessment rate, subject to certain adjustments, with institutions deemed riskier paying higher assessments.\nWe may eliminate dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we pay quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders, stockholders are not entitled to receive dividends. Downturns in domestic and global economies and other factors could cause our board of directors to consider, among other things, the elimination of or reduction in the amount and/or frequency of cash dividends paid on our common stock.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nWe continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthen our controls and ensure compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations. A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us.\nOur failure to effectively deploy capital may have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe invested 50% of the net proceeds from our second step conversion offering in the Bank; provided funding to our Employee Stock Ownership Plan for the purchase of 6,617,421 shares of common stock sold in the offering; and contributed $20.0 million to Investors Charitable foundation by issuing 1,000,000 shares and a $10.0 million cash contribution. A substantial portion of the net proceeds were used to pay off short-term borrowings as they matured and invest in securities. We continue to utilize the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, among other items, paying cash dividends and repurchasing shares of our common stock. Our failure to deploy the capital effectively may reduce our profitability and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nIn December 2019, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Blue Harbour, pursuant to which we repurchased from Blue Harbour the 27,318,628 shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Blue Harbour, at a purchase price of $12.29 per share, representing aggregate cost of approximately $335.7 million.\nOur recruitment efforts may not be sufficient to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations.\nAs we continue to grow, we may find our recruitment efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating experienced or qualified personnel, we may not be able to continue to successfully implement our business strategy.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.\nThe Bank collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both the Bank and third-party service providers. Our operational and security systems, infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our business. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct or malfeasance, or failure or breach of third- party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with our own systems.\nWe handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions every day. Our financial, accounting, data processing, check processing, electronic funds transfer, loan processing, online and mobile banking, automated teller machines, or ATMs, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. This could\nadversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and cyber attacks. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and cause reputational harm.\nA cyber attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third-party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or manage our exposure to risk, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. We rely on digital technologies, computer, database and email systems, software, and networks to conduct our operations. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment.\nFinancial services institutions have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the institution, its employees or customers or of third parties, or otherwise materially disrupt network access or business operations. For example, denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial institutions and several large retailers have disclosed substantial cyber security breaches affecting debit and credit card accounts of their customers. We have experienced cyber security incidents in the past, although not material, and we anticipate that, as a larger bank, we could experience further incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyber attacks or other information or security breaches.\nMisconduct by employees could also result in fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential information. The Bank may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions the Bank takes to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject the Bank to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. The recent massive breach of the systems of a credit bureau presents additional threats as criminals now have more information about a larger portion of the population of the United States than past breaches have involved, which could be used by criminals to pose as customers initiating transfers of money from customer accounts. Although the Bank has policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of its customers, the Bank cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to our reputation.\nAs cyber threats and other fraudulent activity continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Any of these matters could result in our loss of customers and business opportunities, significant disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs. In addition, any of the matters described above could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business. An interruption or cessation of an important service by any third-party could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent for the majority of our technology, including our core operating system, on third-party providers. If these companies were to discontinue providing services to us, we may experience significant disruption to our business. In addition, each of these third parties faces the risk of cyber attack, information breach or loss, or technology failure. If any of our third-party service providers experience such difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to find alternative sources of such services. We are dependent on these third-party providers securing their information systems, over which we have limited control, and a breach of their information systems could adversely affect our ability to process transactions, service our clients or manage our exposure to risk and could result in the disclosure of sensitive, personal customer information, which could have a material adverse impact on our business through damage to our reputation, loss of business, remedial costs, additional regulatory scrutiny or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Assurance cannot be provided that we could negotiate terms with alternative service sources that are as favorable or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all, thereby resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nSevere weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nWeather-related events have adversely impacted our market area in recent years, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the metropolitan New York area and Northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Global market fluctuations may affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.", "PERMNO": 90952, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "ISBC"}
