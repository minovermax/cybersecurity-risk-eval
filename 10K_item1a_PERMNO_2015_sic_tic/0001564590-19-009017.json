Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors are the important factors of which we are aware that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. We operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results, performance or achievements. We cannot assure you that our projected results or events will be achieved or will occur.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Industry\nWe may not be successful in executing our DXL strategy and growing our market share.\nThrough the end of fiscal 2018, we have opened 231 DXL retail and outlet stores in the United States and Canada while closing many of our Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores. The pace of our store openings has slowed over the past two fiscal years with an increased focus on growing our direct business, developing a wholesale business and improving the overall efficiency and profitability of the Company. For us to be successful in the future and maintain growth, we must be able to continue increasing our share of the big & tall men\u2019s apparel market. Our growth is dependent on our ability to continue to build upon our DXL brand, maintain and convert our existing Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing customers to DXL, and to continue to attract new customers. Our failure to execute successfully our strategy could prevent us from growing our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, including if we were unable to:\n\u2022\ngrow our DXL e-commerce business;\n\u2022\npredict and respond to fashion trends, while offering our customers a broad selection of merchandise in an extended selection of sizes;\n\u2022\nmaintain an effective marketing program to build brand, store and digital awareness as well as increase store traffic;\n\u2022\nmaintain our existing customer base;\n\u2022\nattract and retain new customers;\n\u2022\nhire qualified store management and store associates, especially in light of low unemployment rates;\n\u2022\neffectively open and close stores within established cost parameters;\n\u2022\ncontinue to grow and then sustain number of transactions, units-per-transaction and share of wallet; and\n\u2022\noperate at appropriate operating margins.\nOur marketing programs and efforts in maintaining and building our brand awareness, driving traffic and converting that traffic into an increased loyal customer base are critical to achieving market share growth within the big & tall men\u2019s apparel market and may not be successful.\nOur ability to increase our share of the big & tall men\u2019s apparel market is largely dependent on building and maintaining favorable brand recognition for our DXL stores and digital channels and effectively marketing our merchandise to all of our target customers in several diverse market segments so that they will become loyal shoppers who spend a greater portion of their wallet on our product offerings. In order to grow our brand recognition and our market share, we depend on the successful development of our brand through marketing and advertising in a variety of ways, including television and radio advertising, advertising events, loyalty programs, catalogs, digital marketing, including social media, e-commerce and customer prospecting. Our business is directly impacted by the success of these efforts and those of our vendors. Future marketing efforts by us, our vendors or our other licensors, may be costly and, if not successful, may negatively affect our ability to meet our sales goals and gain market share.\nThe recent launch of our wholesale segment may not be successful.\nAs part of our strategic growth plan, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced the launch of a wholesale segment focused on product development and distribution relationships with key retailers. We intend to develop and distribute both private label and co-branded big & tall men\u2019s apparel lines. The success of this strategic initiative depends on a number of factors, including our ability to grow our wholesale customer base, develop a cost-effective infrastructure, and sustain adequate liquidity to meet the longer lead times associated with the wholesale business. In addition, because our wholesale customers order merchandise on a \u201cpurchase order\u201d basis, as our wholesale business grows, any decision by one of our customers to decrease their order volume or cease purchasing from us could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIf we are unable to develop and implement our omni-channel initiatives successfully, our market share and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur customer\u2019s shopping behavior continues to evolve across multiple channels and we are working to meet his needs. While we consider ourselves an omni-channel retailer, we continue to make ongoing investments in our information technology systems to support evolving omni-channel capabilities.\nOmni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and our success depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives.\nIf the investment in our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, our systems are unable to support such initiatives, or if our competitors are more successful, our financial results and our market penetration may be adversely affected.\nOur direct business is a significant component of our growth strategy, and the failure to develop our e-commerce and internet infrastructure could disrupt our business and negatively impact our sales.\nWe continue to have increasing levels of sales made through online shopping and via mobile devices. We have made significant investments in capital spending and labor to develop these channels and invested in digital media to attract new customers. Growth of our overall sales is dependent on customers\u2019 continuing to expand their online purchases in addition to in-store purchases. We cannot accurately predict the rate at which online purchases will expand.\nOur success in growing our direct business will depend in part upon our development of an increasingly sophisticated e-commerce experience and infrastructure. Increasing customer sophistication requires that we provide additional website features and functionality, in order to be competitive in the marketplace and maintain market share. We continually update our website features, but we cannot predict future trends and required functionality or our adoption rate for customer preferences. In addition, we are vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with e-commerce sales, including security breaches, cyber-attacks, consumer privacy concerns, changes in state tax regimes and government regulation of internet activities. Our failure to respond to these risks and uncertainties successfully could reduce our direct sales, increase our costs and diminish our growth prospects, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur business is seasonal and is affected by general economic conditions.\nOur business is seasonal. Historically, a significant portion of our operating income has been generated during our fourth quarter (November-January). If, for any reason, we miscalculate the demand for our products during our fourth quarter, our sales in that quarter could decline, resulting in higher labor costs as a percentage of sales, lower margins and excess inventory, which could cause our annual operating results to suffer. In addition, our operations may be negatively affected by local, regional or national economic conditions, such as levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence. Due to our seasonality, the possible adverse impact from such risks is potentially greater if any such risks occur during our fourth quarter.\nOur ability to operate and expand our business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will depend on the availability of adequate capital.\nThe operation of our business, the rate of our expansion and our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends on cash flow generated by our business and, if necessary, the availability of equity or debt capital. We will also need sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations under our existing debt agreements.\nThe amount that we are able to borrow and have outstanding under our credit facility at any given time is determined using an availability formula based on eligible assets. As a result, our ability to borrow is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as advance rates and the amount and quality of inventory, which could reduce the funds available to us under our credit facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations or cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot ensure that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOur business may be adversely affected by economic and political issues abroad and changes in U.S. economic policies.\nEconomic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source merchandise for our global sourcing program, as well as shipping and docking issues, could adversely affect the availability and cost of such merchandise. Disruptions in the global transportation network, such as political instability, the financial instability of our suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, labor and port strikes, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. In the event of disruptions or delays in deliveries due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. These and other issues affecting our suppliers could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWhile current tariffs have not had a material impact on our business, any further enactment of any new legislation in the U.S. that would impact current international trade regulations, exports or imports or tax policy with respect to foreign activities, or executive action affecting international trade agreements, including the uncertainty concerning the trading status of certain countries and/or retaliatory duties, taxes, quotas or other trade sanctions, could increase the cost of merchandise purchased from suppliers in such countries and could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nThe loss of, or disruption in, our centralized distribution center could negatively impact our business and operations.\nThe majority of our merchandise for our stores and e-commerce operations is received into our centralized distribution center in Canton, Massachusetts, where it is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores or directly to our customers. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of the distribution center. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and well-positioned to support our strategic plans, events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, employee matters or shipping problems, could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores or directly to our customers.\nWith all of our management information systems centralized in our corporate headquarters, any disruption or destruction of our system infrastructure could materially affect our business. This type of disaster is mitigated by our offsite storage and disaster recovery plans, but we would still incur business interruption that may impact our business for several weeks.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance, we cannot be sure that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, in the event our distribution center is shut down for any reason or if we incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption from our distribution center.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the failure to identify suitable store locations and acceptable lease terms.\nWe currently lease all of our store locations. Identifying and securing suitable store locations at acceptable lease terms is critical to our store base and positioning. We generally have been able to negotiate acceptable lease rates and extensions, as needed. However, we cannot be certain that desirable locations at acceptable lease rates and preferred lease terms will continue to be available. Once we decide on a prospective new store or new market and find a suitable location, any delays in opening new stores could impact our financial results. In addition, if we need to pay higher occupancy costs in the future to secure ideal locations, the increased cost may adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity. Recent trends toward increased landlord consolidation could also negatively affect our ability to obtain and retain locations.\nOur business is highly competitive, and competitive factors may reduce our revenues and profit margins.\nThe United States big & tall men\u2019s apparel market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, mass merchandisers, specialty apparel retailers, discount stores and online retailers offering a broad range of apparel products similar to the products that we sell. Besides retail competitors, we consider any manufacturer of big & tall men\u2019s merchandise operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor. It is also possible that another competitor, either a mass merchant or a men\u2019s specialty store or specialty apparel catalog, could gain market share in big & tall men\u2019s apparel due to more favorable pricing, locations, brand and fashion assortment and size availability. Many of our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do.\nThe presence in the marketplace of various fashion trends and the limited availability of shelf space also can affect competition. We may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors in the future and could lose brand recognition and market share. A significant loss of market share would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, we maintain exclusivity arrangements with several of the brands that we carry. If we were to lose any of these exclusivity arrangements or brands altogether, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges.\nPeriodically, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Specifically, if an individual store location is unable to generate sufficient future cash flows, we may be required to record a partial or full impairment of that store\u2019s assets. In addition, significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets (such as store relocations or closures) may also result in impairment charges. Any such impairment charges, if significant, could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the manufacture of the merchandise we sell.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and are therefore entirely dependent on third parties to manufacture the merchandise we sell. Without adequate supplies of merchandise to sell to our customers in the merchandise styles and fashions demanded by our particular customer base, sales would decrease materially and our business would suffer. We are dependent on these third parties\u2019 ability to fulfill our merchandise orders and meet our delivery terms. In the event that manufacturers are unable or unwilling to ship products to us in a timely manner or continue to manufacture products for us, we would have to rely on other current manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new manufacturers. We might not be able to identify or qualify such manufacturers for existing or new products in a timely manner and such manufacturers might not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Our inability to secure adequate and timely supplies of private label merchandise would negatively impact proper inventory levels, sales and gross margin rates, and ultimately our results of operations.\nIn addition, even if our current manufacturers continue to manufacture our products, they may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality and may not continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards. If we were forced to rely on manufacturers who produce products of inferior quality, then our brand recognition and customer satisfaction would likely suffer. These manufacturers may also increase the cost to us of the products we purchase from them.\nA significant portion of our merchandise is imported directly from other countries, and U.S. domestic suppliers who source their goods from other countries supply most of our remaining merchandise. While current tariffs have not had a material impact on our business, if the U.S. Government imposes any further tariffs or other restrictions on foreign imports, we may need to increase our prices, which could adversely affect our revenues and merchandise margins.\nFurthermore, in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, we may not be able to maintain adequate inventory levels of important merchandise on a consistent basis, which would negatively impact our sales and potentially erode the confidence of our customer base, leading to further loss of sales and an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used in the manufacturing of our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin or on our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands. The prices for fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. To the extent that we cannot offset these cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies, such higher costs will need to be passed on to our customers. Such increased costs could lead to reduced customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.\nOur success depends significantly on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain additional personnel.\nOur future success is dependent on the personal efforts, performance and abilities of our key management, which includes our executive officers as well as several significant members of our senior management. The loss of any of our senior management may result in a loss of organizational focus, poor operating execution, an inability to identify and execute strategic initiatives, an impairment in our ability to identify new store locations, and an inability to consummate possible acquisitions. The competition is intense for the type of highly skilled individuals with relevant industry experience that we require and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain new employees of the caliber needed to achieve our objectives.\nOur business may be negatively impacted and we may be liable if third parties misappropriate proprietary information of our customers and breach our security systems.\nWe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information. During fiscal 2018, approximately 86% of our sales were settled through credit and debit card transactions. While our Board of Directors has a Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Committee to oversee the monitoring and management of cyber risk and data privacy for our Company, and we have not had any security breaches to date, any breach could expose us to risks of loss, litigation and liability and could adversely affect our operations as well as cause our shoppers to stop shopping with us as a result of their lack of confidence in the security of their personally identifiable information, which could have a negative impact on our sales and\nprofitability. Like many retailers, we have seen an increase in cyberattack attempts, predominantly through phishing and social engineering scams, and in particular, ransomware. While none of these attempts has been successful, there can be no assurance that our continued security measures will be effective or sufficient in the future. If third parties are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate the personal information or credit card information of our customers or if third parties gain unauthorized and improper access to such information, we could be subject to liability. These liabilities could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims, or claims for other misuses of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes, and could ultimately result in litigation. Liability for misappropriation of this information could be significant.\nFurther, if a third party were to use this proprietary customer information in order to compete with us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and could result in litigation.\nWe may be unable to predict fashion trends and customer preferences successfully.\nCustomer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and tend to change rapidly. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to predict effectively and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands and to translate market trends to appropriate saleable product offerings. If we are unable to predict or respond to changing styles or trends successfully and misjudge the market for products or any new product lines, our sales will be impacted and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. In response, we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which would decrease our revenues and margins. In addition, the failure to satisfy consumer demand, specifically in our DXL stores and websites, could have serious longer-term consequences, such as an adverse impact on our brand value and the loss of market share to our competitors.\nThe loss of any of our key trademarks or licenses could adversely affect demand for our products.\nWe own and use a number of trademarks and operate under several trademark license agreements. We believe that certain of these trademarks have significant value and are instrumental in our ability to create and sustain demand for and to market our products. We cannot be certain that these trademarks and licensing agreements will remain in effect and enforceable or that any license agreements, upon expiration, can be renewed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, any future disputes concerning these trademarks and licenses may cause us to incur significant litigation costs or force us to suspend use of the disputed trademarks.\nOur business depends on our ability to meet our labor needs.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store managers and sales associates, who understand and appreciate our product offerings and are able to represent our products to our customers adequately. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the retail industry is high. If we are unable to hire and retain sales associates capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, our business could be materially adversely affected. Although none of our employees is currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, our employees may elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could increase our labor costs. Additionally, competition for qualified employees requires us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of adequate employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may cause problems for our stores or outlets. Any such delays, any material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or outlets or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nFailure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance.\nOur business is subject to federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, such as state and local wage and hour laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), securities laws, import and export laws (including customs regulations), privacy and information security regulations, unclaimed property laws, the Affordable Care Act and many others. The effect of some of these laws and regulations may be to increase the cost of doing business and may have a material impact on our earnings. In addition, the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to legal and regulatory requirements and increased enforcement. In addition, as a result of operating in the U.K. and Canada, we must comply with laws and regulations of those countries, which may differ substantially from, and may conflict with, corresponding U.S. laws and regulations. We may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry, country or practice. If we fail to comply with laws, rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, we may be subject to government enforcement action, class action litigation or other litigation, damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, and increased cost of regulatory compliance, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile due to many factors.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may increase or decrease rapidly in the future depending on news announcements and changes in general market conditions. The following factors, among others, may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price:\n\u2022\noverall changes in the economy and general market volatility;\n\u2022\nnews announcements regarding our quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nquarterly comparable sales;\n\u2022\nacquisitions;\n\u2022\ncompetitive developments;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation (such as increased wage and paid benefits laws);\n\u2022\nlitigation affecting us; or\n\u2022\nmarket views as to the prospects of the retail industry generally.\nRights of our stockholders may be negatively affected if we issue any of the shares of preferred stock, which our Board of Directors has authorized for issuance.\nWe have available for issuance up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue any or all of these shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without any further action on the part of stockholders. The rights of our stockholders may be negatively affected if we issue a series of preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or distribution upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nIn addition, the issuance of preferred stock by our Board of Directors pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, as amended, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of the outstanding voting stock of our Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, limits transfers of our common stock and may, along with state law, inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains provisions that restrict any person or entity from attempting to purchase our stock, without prior permission from the Board of Directors, to the extent that such transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a five-percent shareholder of our stock, or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing five-percent shareholder. These provisions provide that any transfer that violates such provisions shall be null and void and would require the purported transferee to, upon demand by us, transfer the shares that exceed the five percent limit to an agent designated by us for the purpose of conducting a sale of such excess shares. These provisions would make the acquisition of our Company more expensive to the acquirer and could significantly delay, discourage, or prevent third parties from acquiring our Company without the approval of our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain provisions of Delaware law, which could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including, without limitation, discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock. The provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 11379, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "DXLG"}
