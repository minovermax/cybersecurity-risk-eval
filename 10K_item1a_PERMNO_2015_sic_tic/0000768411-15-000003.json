{"cik": "768411", "company": "CYBEROPTICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our financial results, and the accuracy of the forward looking statements we make in this Form 10-K. We make statements regarding anticipated product introductions and performance, changes in markets, customers and customer order rates, expenditures in research and development, growth in revenue and improvement in profits, taxation levels, the effects of pricing, and competition, all of which represent our expectations and beliefs about future events. Our actual results may vary from these expectations because of a number of factors that affect our business, the most important of which include the following:\n\u2022\nWe are currently in the process of introducing a number of products based upon our new 3D MRS technology and the failure of this technology to perform up to our expectations would materially adversely affect our anticipated operating results. We believe our MRS technology is unique in the marketplace based upon its ability to inhibit reflections and offer microscopic quality images at production line speeds, and we have high expectations about the prospect for longer-term sales of products based on this technology. We have incorporated the MRS technology into several of the products that we are currently introducing or are about to introduce, including our new 3D AOI offering, the SQ3000, the CyberGage 360 product we intend to launch for the 3D scanning market in the second quarter, and products for OEM customers, including KLA-Tencor. We also expect to use this technology in the next generation of other inspection products and in products for new applications. Although we believe the MRS technology has performed well in pre-release or \u201cbeta\u201d versions of some of these products, it has not been used by customers in a commercially released form that has been purchased by the customer, and has not been used long-term in a full-scale production environment. New technologies often encounter issues in application and new products often contain operational issues that are resolved only after use. If the performance of the MRS technology does not meet our expectations, if the products we are introducing based upon the MRS technology do not operate up to specifications, or if the market otherwise does not find this technology attractive, our operating results for the current year, and our expectations for longer term growth, would be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nOur business has been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the global economy and uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy makes it more likely that our actual results will differ materially from expectations. In 2009, the world economy experienced the worst economic recession since the great depression of the 1930\u2019s. The severe economic conditions were brought about by extreme disruptions in global credit and financial markets including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Further political instability or uncertainty could cause new tightening of credit in financial markets, may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, and may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. The OEMs to which we sell our sensors supply SMT manufacturers, and those manufacturers, as well as the circuit board manufacturers that purchase our SMT inspection system products directly, are largely dependent on continued demand for consumer and commercial electronics, including cell phones, smart phones and computers. Demand for electronics is a function of the health of the economies in the United States and around the world. Sales of our semiconductor products and 3D scanning solutions are also dependent upon the health of the global economy. Our results would be adversely affected in the future, if these economies were to move into recession.\n\u2022\nWorld events beyond our control may affect our operations. Our operations and markets could be negatively affected by world events that effect economies and commerce in the specific countries, such as China, Singapore and Japan, in which we do business. Natural disasters, such as the tsunami and earthquake that hit Japan and the floods that hit Thailand in 2011, have affected travel patterns and accessibility in these countries in the past and other natural occurrences, such as a bird flu outbreak, could affect the business we do in these countries in the future. Terrorist activity or other armed conflicts that could occur in countries in which we do business, labor disputes that impact complex international shipping arrangements, or other unanticipated actions by local populations could affect our ability to do business in specific geographies. Many of the countries in which we do business can be affected by economic forces that are different from the forces that affect the United States and change the amount of business we conduct.\n\u2022\nOur operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly, from quarter to quarter, causing volatility in our stock price. Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter, causing volatility in our stock price. Some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to price and volume fluctuations include changes in customer demand for our sensors, inspection systems and 3D scanning solutions, which is influenced by economic conditions in these industries and the overall health of the global economy, demand for products that use circuit boards and semiconductors, market acceptance of our products and those developed by our customers, competition, seasonal variations in customer demand, the timing, cancellation or delay of customer orders, shipments and acceptance, product development costs, including increased research, development, engineering and marketing expenses associated with our introduction of new products and product enhancements.\n\u2022\nThe markets for capital equipment in the electronics assembly and semiconductor industries in which we operate are cyclical and we cannot predict with precision when market downturns will occur. We operate in a cyclical market-the electronics assembly capital equipment market-that periodically adjusts independent of global economic conditions. We have been unable to predict with accuracy the timing or magnitude of periodic downturns in this market. These downturns, particularly the severe downturns in electronics production markets from 2001 through 2003, and from 2008 through 2009, have severely affected our operations and generated several years of unprofitable operations. Ultimately, we have difficulty determining the duration or severity of any market downturns, the strength of any subsequent recoveries, and the long-term impact that the market may have on our business.\n\u2022\nOur operating results and financial position could be negatively affected by acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of Laser Design, Inc. On March 14, 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Laser Design, Inc. (LDI), a 3D metrology company located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for aggregate consideration of $3.1 million cash, plus the assumption of certain current liabilities. If the LDI business does not perform as anticipated, we may be forced to incur additional expense to enhance its development, sales or marketing capabilities, negatively impacting our earnings and financial position. In addition, we may be unable to successfully complete integration of LDI or other businesses that we choose to acquire in the future in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner. Business acquisitions present a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operational matters, current products and customers;\n\u2022\nlack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies;\n\u2022\nfailure to commercialize or meet the expected performance of the new technology or business;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key employees and customer or supplier relationships;\n\u2022\nlower-than-expected market opportunities or market acceptance of any new products; and\n\u2022\nunexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products.\nOur failure to realize the intended benefits of one or more acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities.\n\u2022\nSales to our two largest OEM customers constituted a significant portion of our revenue in 2014 and loss of either of these customers, or a decline in the customer\u2019s business, would have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations. Sales to our two principal OEM sensor customers constituted 25% of our total revenue in 2014. Although we do not anticipate any impact on the level of business we conduct with them, our two largest OEM customers have completed or are nearing completion of business combination transactions that could impact our business relationships. If the order rates of these customers are negatively impacted by global economic events beyond their control, competitive factors, or if they or new owners or management choose sensors or inspection systems manufactured by other suppliers, or otherwise terminate their relationships with us, our long-term results of operations would be significantly adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe generate approximately three quarters of our revenue from export sales that are subject to risks of international operations. Our export sales are subject to many of the risks of international operations including:\n\u2022\ncurrency controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in local market business requirements and increased cost and development time required to modify and translate our products for local markets;\n\u2022\ninability to recruit qualified personnel in a specific country or region;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing and maintaining relationships with local vendors;\n\u2022\ndiffering foreign technical standards;\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nexport restrictions and controls, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax assessments; and\n\u2022\nterrorism, disease, or other events that may affect local economies and access.\n\u2022\nOur development and assembly operations in Singapore, and our sales operations in Asia, are subject to unique risks because of the remote nature of the operations. Our Singapore development and manufacturing operations, and our Asian sales operations, present a number of risks related to the retention of personnel, management of product development and operations, management and access to customer and distributor interactions, control over administrative and business processes, regulatory and legal issues we may encounter and other matters relating to foreign operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain software development and management personnel in Singapore, and sales personnel in other territories, who are reliable and who will accept employment terms that are attractive. Although most components for our system products are more readily available in Singapore, some of the hardware components used in our system products necessary for manufacture in Singapore may be difficult to import at efficient rates. Our financial performance, ability to serve our customers and ability to manufacture and sell products could be negatively impacted if we are unable to retain our Asian based employees, if it costs more than expected to retain these employees or hire other experienced employees in a timely manner, if we are unable to manage these employees appropriately, or if we are unable to locate suitable sources of supply for our products manufactured in Asia.\n\u2022\nWe price our products in U.S. dollars, and as a result, our products may have difficulty competing in periods of increasing strength of the dollar. Most of our international export sales are negotiated, invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, currency fluctuations do not affect our revenue per unit. However, significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an impact on the price competitiveness of our products relative to foreign competitors, which could impact the willingness of customers to purchase our products and have an impact on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nBecause of our significant operations in Singapore, our costs are negatively impacted when the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the Singapore dollar. A significant portion of our cost of revenues, research and development and sales and marketing costs are denominated in the Singapore dollar. In addition, other sales and marketing costs are denominated in British Pounds Sterling and the Chinese Yuan, resulting from our sales offices located in the UK and China. Our costs will increase, and our results will be negatively impacted in future periods, if the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the currencies of these countries.\n\u2022\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies associated with our subsidiary in Singapore, which may result in losses. At December 31, 2014, our open foreign exchange forward contracts were in an unrealized loss position equal to $352,000 on a pre-tax basis due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Singapore dollar in 2014. If the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Singapore dollar were to remain unchanged over the next twelve months, we would realize this loss through our consolidated statement of operations. However, because we do not fully hedge all of our future anticipated cash flows in Singapore dollars, the portion of our costs that we do not hedge would be lower in relation to recent quarters. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken in future periods in relation to the Singapore dollar, the unrealized loss on our open foreign exchange forward contracts would be reduced, but costs that are not hedged would increase. The ultimate impact of any fluctuation in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and Singapore dollar is dependent on the level of Singapore denominated cash flows in future periods.\n\u2022\nOur products could become obsolete. Our current products, as well as the products we have under development, are designed to operate with the technology that we believe currently exists or may exist for electronic components, printed circuit boards, memory modules and semiconductor manufacturing. The products we develop to meet customer needs and requirements are subject to rapid technological change, and because it takes considerable time to develop new products, we must anticipate industry trends, as well as technological developments, in order to effectively compete. Further, because we do not have unlimited development resources, we might choose to forgo the pursuit of what becomes a leading technology or market and devote our resources to technologies and markets that are less successful. If we incorrectly anticipate technology developments or market trends, or have inadequate resources to develop our products to deal with changes in technology and markets, our products could become obsolete.\n\u2022\nAdvances in the SMT electronics assembly alignment sensor market have eliminated some of the advantages of our sensors. Our SMT electronic assembly alignment sensor products compete with products made by larger machine vision companies, other optical sensor companies, and by solutions internally developed by our customers. Advances in machine vision technology in recent years have eliminated some, but not all, of the advantages that have differentiated our products from some of these competitors, and advances in other technologies could eliminate other advantages.\n\u2022\nThe market for surface mount capital equipment has become more mature and price competitive, negatively impacting our margins. The electronics capital equipment market for surface mount technologies is becoming more mature, resulting in increased price pressure on suppliers of equipment. Consequently, our SMT electronic assembly inspection systems and alignment sensor products have become subject to increased levels of price competition and competition from other suppliers and technologies, including suppliers in Asia who have specifically designed their products to compete favorably against our products.\n\u2022\nBecause of the high cost of changing equipment, customers in our markets are sometimes resistant to purchasing our products even if they are superior. We believe that, because of the high cost of installation and integration of new inspection equipment into production lines, once an SMT customer has selected a vendor\u2019s capital equipment, the customer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor\u2019s equipment. Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh the expense of installing and integrating new systems, it may be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to a customer that currently uses a competitor\u2019s equipment.\n\u2022\nOur ability to compete in the market for SMT inspection systems is dependent upon the sales skills of our channel of independent sales representatives, value added resellers and distributors. Our ability to successfully compete in the market for SMT inspection systems is dependent upon the ability of our channel partners to sell our products. To the extent our competitors have relationships with stronger channel partners, it may be difficult for us to achieve significant sales, even if our products are technologically superior.\n\u2022\nCompetitors in Asia may be able to compete favorably with us based on lower production, employee costs and in some cases, governmental support. We compete with large multinational companies when selling our inspection system products, many of which are able to take advantage of greater financial resources and larger sales distribution networks. We also compete with new Asian based suppliers, many of which may have lower overall production and employee costs and are willing to offer their products at lower selling prices to customers. Further, we believe some competitors receive government sponsored research and manufacturing assistance that can cause their relative cost of development of new products to be lower, and are under less market pressure to forgo the short-term income impact of concentrated investment in research and development.\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to credit risk through sales to our OEM customers and distributors of our stand-alone system products. We sell our products through three key OEM customers, and usually have significant credit exposure with respect to these customers. In addition, we sell our stand-alone inspection system products through a network of international distributors. These distributors tend to be smaller in size with limited financial resources and access to capital. Although these distributors do not hold our products in inventory for re-sale, we are exposed to credit risk and would incur losses if they are unable to pay for the products they have purchased from us.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent upon outside suppliers for components of our products, and delays in or unavailability of those components would adversely affect our results. We use outside contractors to manufacture the components used in many of our products and some of the components we order require significant lead times that could affect our ability to sell our products if not available. In addition, if these components do not meet stringent quality requirements or become subject to obsolescence, there could be delays in product availability, and we could be required to make significant investments in designing replacement components.\n\u2022\nFuture sales of MX600 will require a significant upfront investment in working capital. The materials handling equipment for our MX600 system for post-singulation memory inspection, which constitutes the vast majority of the content and cost of the system, is manufactured by a third-party contractor. We are required to make significant upfront inventory investments with that contractor to facilitate future sales of the MX600 system, and we cannot be assured that, if significant orders of the system were received, the contractor would be able to satisfy our production needs. If for some reason our supplier for these systems should fail to appropriately complete their work in a timely manner, or if our end customer should ultimately fail to accept and pay for these systems, we could incur losses.\n\u2022\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors may be able to duplicate and enhance what we have created. We own or have licensed a number of patents, and have filed applications for additional patents. Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future. In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. Further, third parties may also design around these patents. In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology. We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties. Even though these agreements are in place there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition. Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.\n\u2022\nProtection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights. We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights. Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties. From time to time, we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties. These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products stopped by an injunction. Infringement claims could also cause product delays or require us to redesign our products and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues. We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party\u2019s proprietary rights. We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our products, or make the sale of these products more expensive.\n\u2022\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S., and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad. Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries. If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.\n\u2022\nBreaches of our network security could expose us to losses. We manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. There has been an increasing incidence of unauthorized access to the computer networks of various technology companies, and we are not immune to attempted unauthorized access. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. These parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. Attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses, compromise our competitive advantages and damage our reputation with customers.\n\u2022\nThe absence of significant market liquidity in our common stock could impact the ability of our shareholders to purchase and sell larger blocks, the attractiveness of our stock to institutional shareholders, and the market value of our common stock. There were 6,643,851 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Although our common stock is traded in the NASDAQ Global Market, in part because of the number of shares we have outstanding and available for trading, the daily trading volume in our stock is low, averaging less than 50,000 shares per day. Shareholders wishing to purchase or sell larger blocks of stock may not be able to do so quickly, and disposal by any shareholder of a significant block of stock could adversely affect the sale price in the marketplace. Further, institutional investors often have policies against investment in stock that is illiquid, and many institutional investors may elect not to purchase or hold our stock because of the inability to dispose of it. The reduced institutional interest, as well as the lack of current evaluations by securities analysts, has had and can be expected to continue to have a further adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 11825, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "CYBE"}
