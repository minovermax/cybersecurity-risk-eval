{"cik": "1004989", "company": "SPAR Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in SGRP's common stock (\"SGRP Common Stock\") is subject to a number of Risks that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected or otherwise expected in any forward-looking statements or other information (see Forward-Looking Statements immediately preceding Part I, above).\nYou should carefully review and consider the following Risks, but you should not place undue reliance on any of them. All forward-looking statements and other information attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly subject to and qualified by all such Risks.\nThose Risks reflect our expectations, views and assumptions only as of the date of this Annual Report, and the Company does not intend, assume any obligation, or promise to publicly update or revise any such Risk or information (in whole or in part), whether as a result of new information, new or worsening Risks or uncertainties, changed circumstances, future events, recognition, or otherwise.\nOur results of operations were adversely affected in 2020 globally by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the adverse impact continued through 2021 in certain international countries. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue through 2022 and beyond.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company\u2019s financial condition and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on its financial condition, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce.\nIn 2020, many of our clients were impacted by temporary retail closures, reduced in-store hours, in-store customer limits and product shipping delays. As a result, the Company implemented several cost-saving measures which included a reduction in the use of contracted workers, furloughing employees, reducing hours and a reduction in other corporate and non-critical expenses.\nIn 2021, most of our clients whose business was shut down or reduced capacity earlier in 2020 returned to normal operations, and the overall business has improved as the fiscal year of 2021 ended. However, many international countries continue to be impacted. Although the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the continuing pandemic, we do not anticipate a continual material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe markets we operate in are cyclical and subject to the effects of economic downturns.\nThe markets in which the Company operates are cyclical and subject to the effects of economic downturns. The current political, social and economic conditions, including the impact of terrorism and COVID-19 on consumer and business behavior, make it difficult for the Company, its vendors and its clients to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Substantially all of the Company's key clients are either retailers, manufacturers or those seeking to do product merchandising at retailers. Should the retail or manufacturing industries experience a significant economic downturn, the resultant reduction in product sales could significantly decrease the Company's revenues. The Company also has risks associated with its clients changing their business plans and/or reducing their marketing budgets in response to economic conditions, which could also significantly decrease the Company's revenues. Such revenue decreases could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition.\nWe can be adversely affected if governments pass legislation that mandates an increase in wages, changes labor laws or otherwise drives market behavior that negatively impacts the business or operations of SPAR Group or our clients.\nBecause the Company has operations in 9 distinct countries and relies on independent contractors as well as other third-party providers to perform work, there is risk that any government legislation that restricts travel, changes labor laws, impacts wages or otherwise incentivizes behavior that negatively impacts our business or our clients, could impact our business.\nThe continued legislative trend to increase minimum wages is one of these risks. The minimum wage in states, cities and municipalities in the United States has been steadily increasing over the last several years. A similar risk is the trend of legislatures and courts to apply those minimum wages and other benefits to ever increasing pools of workers. We monitor these increases and trends and plan for future known changes as we manage our business and establish agreements with clients.\nThe Company continues to analyze various aspects of potential business impact driven by any legislation in all of the countries we operate. While we do not foresee any material impact in the short-term, the Company will continue to monitor and manage the business accordingly.\nOur business depends on variable client projects that can shift from period to period, be delayed, be canceled or otherwise require us to assume higher costs to perform the work.\nThe Company has experienced and, in the future, may experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results and cash flow. Factors that may cause the Company's quarterly operating results and cash flow to vary from time to time and may result in reduced revenue and profits include: (i) the number of active client projects; (ii) seasonality of client products; (iii) client delays, changes and cancellations in projects; (iv) staffing requirements, indemnifications, risk allocations, primary insurance coverages, intellectual property claims and other contractual provisions and concessions demanded by clients that are unilateral, unreasonable and very time consuming to review and attempt to negotiate; (v) the timing requirements of client projects; (vi) the completion of major client projects; (vii) the timing of new engagements; (viii) the timing of personnel cost increases; (ix) service locations and conditions with higher than contemplated personnel costs (remote areas, higher minimum wages, higher skill sets required, etc.); and (x) the loss of major clients. In addition, the Company is subject to revenue or profit uncertainties resulting from factors such as unprofitable client work and the failure of clients to pay. These revenue fluctuations could materially and adversely affect the Company or its performance or condition, whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nOur business could be adversely affected if retailers and manufacturers elect to perform merchandising and marketing services with their own resources or if they have less stores that need our services.\nThe business and growth of the Company depends in part on the continued outsourcing of merchandising and marketing services, which the Company believes has increased from the consolidation of retailers and manufacturers, as well as the desire to seek outsourcing specialists to reduce fixed operation expenses and concentrate internal staff on customer service and sales. There can be no assurance that this outsourcing will continue, as companies may elect to perform such services internally.\nIn addition, retailers with physical store locations are facing increasing consolidation and competition from eCommerce/virtual stores. The Company's business and growth depends in part on the continuing need for in-store merchandising of products and the continuing success of retailers with physical store locations. There can be no assurance that the in-store merchandising of products will increase or even continue at current levels or that retailers with physical store locations will continue to compete successfully in those stores, and some retailers are shifting their sales focus to their virtual online stores.\nA significant decrease in such need for in-store merchandising or success of such physical stores could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and such decreased revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition, whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nWe do work with furniture and other related assembly services at stores, in homes and in offices.\nThe Company's technicians assemble furniture and other products in the stores, homes and offices of customers. Working at a customer's store, home or office could give rise to claims against the Company for errors, omissions or misconduct by those technicians, including (without limitation) harassment, personal injury, death, damage to or theft of customer property, or other civil or criminal misconduct by such technicians. Claims also could be made against the Company as a result of its involvement in such assembly services due to (among other things) product assembly errors and omissions, product defects, deficiencies, breakdowns or collapse, products that are not merchantable or fit for their particular purpose, products that do not conform to published specifications or satisfy customer expectations, or products that cause personal injury, death or property damage, in each case whether actual, alleged or perceived by customers, and irrespective of how much time may have passed since such assembly. If such claims are asserted and adversely determined against the Company, then to the extent such claims are not covered by indemnification from the product's seller or manufacturer or by insurance, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition.\nWe depend upon third-party independent contractors and the services they provide.\nThe success of the Company's Domestic business is dependent upon the successful execution and administration of its domestic field services through the services of Field Specialists, and a significant portion of them are provided to the Company and are engaged by the Independent Field Vendor and located, scheduled, deployed and administered domestically through the services of Field Administrators. The inability to identify, engage and successfully administer its domestic field services through qualified Field Specialists and Field Administrators could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition.\nA significant portion of the services of the Field Specialists provided to the Company are supplied by the Independent Field Vendor. It is possible that the appropriateness of the treatment of those Field Specialists as independent contractors by the Independent Field Vendor will be periodically subject to legal review or challenge by various states and others. The Company, in its discretion, may review and decide each request by its Independent Field Vendor for reimbursement of its legal defense expenses on a case-by-case basis, including the relative costs and benefits to the Company of doing so, but the Company has no obligation to do so.\nTo the Company's knowledge, its Independent Field Vendor is not involved in any material proceeding involving the misclassification of its independent contractors. However: (i) if the Company approves its reimbursement of any material legal defense costs of the Independent Field Vendor; (ii) if the Company somehow becomes liable for any legal expenses incurred by the Independent Field Vendor, any related party or any third party in defending any claim or satisfying any judgment against such parties; (iii) if the Company somehow becomes liable through any judicial determination for any judgment against the Independent Field Vendor, the Independent Field Administrator, or any related party or other vendor or service provider (in whole or in part); or (iv) if any such proceeding or matter causes: (A) any decrease in the Independent Field Administrator's or the Independent Field Vendor's performance (quality or otherwise); (B) any inability by the Independent Field Administrator or the Independent Field Vendor to execute the services for the Company or to continue with its present business model; or (C) any increase in the Company's use of employees (rather than independent contractors) as its domestic Field Specialists; then any of the foregoing, in whole or in part, could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition.\nThere can be no assurance that plaintiffs or someone else will not claim that the Company is liable (under applicable law, through reimbursement or indemnification, or otherwise) for any judgment or similar amount imposed against any provider of Field Specialists or Field Administrators to the Company, which the Company would defend vigorously if pursued. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to successfully defend any such claim. Any imposition of liability on the Company for any such judgment or amount could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition.\nHowever, the claims of the Significant Stockholders (defined below) that the Company was somehow liable for claims against their companies for their provision of Field Specialists and Field Administrators to the Company through July 2018 have been resolved and released pursuant to the Change of Control, Voting and Restricted Stock Agreement (\u201cCIC Agreement\u201d) See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Overview, below.\nAdditionally, the Company believes that its business model of executing a significant portion of its services domestically (other than in California, where the Company is using its own employees) through independent contractors provided by others is equally effective but inherently less costly than doing so with employees, both under applicable tax and employment laws and otherwise. However, the Company continues to reevaluate its business model of using third party independent contractors as Field Specialists outside of California in light of changing client requirements and legal and regulatory environments.\nWe rely on our systems and third-party vendors.\nThe Company relies on its proprietary systems for (among other things) the scheduling, tracking, coordination and reporting of its merchandising and marketing services. In addition to proprietary software and applications of the Company, the systems use and rely upon software (including operating system, office, exchange, data base and server programs) licensed and hardware purchased or leased from third parties and telecommunication services provided by third parties, which third-party software, hardware and telecommunication services may not continue to be available at all or (if available) with the necessary access, uptime, speeds or bandwidth, at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms. Any defect, error or other performance failure in such third-party software, hardware or service also could result in a defect, error or performance failure in our client services. Systems can experience excess traffic and related inefficiencies, from increased demand or otherwise, as well as increased cyberattacks by hackers and other saboteurs. To the extent that systems experience increased demands on current capacity and for additional capacity from (among other things) an increase in the numbers of users, frequency or duration of use, bandwidth requirements of software, applications and users (including the increasing demand from the Company's clients for data-intensive as-serviced pictures from the Field Specialists), or cyberattacks, there can be no assurance that the Company's technological systems and third-party software, hardware and telecommunication providers will continue to be able to support the demands placed on them by such increased demand or negative events.\nThe Company relies on third-party vendors to provide its telecommunication network access and other services used in its business, and the Company has no control over such third-party providers. Additionally, a cybersecurity breach that results in unauthorized access to sensitive consumer or corporate information contained in these systems may adversely affect the Company's reputation and lead to claims against it. Such claims could include identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims and claims related to violations of applicable data privacy laws. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to the Company's operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to the Company's data, or results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to the Company's reputation, affect its relationships with its customers, lead to claims against it and ultimately harm its business. In addition, the Company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nAny such software, hardware or service unavailability or unreasonable pricing or terms, defect, error or other performance failure in such third-party software, hardware or service, increased capacity demands, disruption in services, security breach or protective measures could increase the Company's costs of operation and reduce its efficiency and performance, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition, whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nOur stock is subject to volatility and general market risk.\nThe market price of SGRP Common Stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the sale price of SGRP Common Stock fluctuated from $1.01 to $3.86 per share. The Company believes that its Common Stock is subject to wide price fluctuations due to (among other things) the following:\n\u25cf\nThe relatively small public float and corresponding thin trading market for SGRP Common Stock, attributable to (among other things) the large block of voting shares beneficially owned by the Company's Majority Stockholders (as defined below) and generally low trading volumes, and that thin trading market may cause small trades to have significant impacts on SGRP Common Stock price.\n\u25cf The substantial beneficial ownership of the Company's voting stock and potential control by Mr. Robert G. Brown and Mr. William H. Bartels and related parties (the \"Majority Stockholders\"). See Our significant stockholders may take actions, subject to the restrictions of the Change of Control, Voting and Restricted Stock Agreement (\u201cCIC Agreement\u201d) and our By-Laws, Item 3 -- Legal Proceedings, below, Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions Domestic Related Party - (including Change of Control, Voting and Restricted Stock Agreement), below.\n\u25cf\nAny announcement, estimate or disclosure by the Company, or any projection or other claim or pronouncement by any of the Company's competitors or any financial analyst, commentator, blogger or other person, respecting: (i) any new service created or improved, significant contract, business acquisition or relationship, or other publicized development by the Company or any of its competitors; or (ii) any change, fluctuation or other development in the Company's actual, estimated or desired affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition or in those of any of the Company's competitors, in each case irrespective of accuracy or validity and whether or not adverse or material.\n\u25cf\nThe general volatility of stock markets, consumer and investor confidence, and the general state of the economy (which often affect the prices of stock issued by the Company and many others without regard to financial results or condition).\nIf the Company issues (other than at fair market value for cash) or the Majority Stockholders sell a large number of shares of SGRP Common Stock, or if the market perceives such an issuance or sale is likely or imminent, the market price of SGRP Common Stock could decline and that decline could be significant.\nThe Company currently has in place a Repurchase Program (as defined and described in Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, below). Those repurchases could adversely affect the market liquidity of the SGRP Common Stock.\nIn addition, the volatility in the market price of SGRP Common Stock could lead to class action securities litigation that could in turn impose substantial costs on the Company, divert management's attention and resources from the day-to-day operations of the Company's business and harm the Company's stock price, the Company or its performance or condition.\nAs a small company with stock price volatility, our stock may be de-listed from NASDAQ.\nSGRP received a notification letter from Nasdaq dated April 23, 2020 (the \"Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter\"), stating that SGRP had failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share for shares of the SGRP Common Stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days preceding the Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter (i.e., March 11, 2020 - April 22, 2020) as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Rule\"). The Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter provided that SGRP had until December 28, 2020 as a grace period to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by maintaining a closing bid price of $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. On December 28, 2020, Nasdaq sent SGRP a letter stating in part that SGRP had regained compliance during the extended grace period with Nasdaq's minimum Bid Price Rule and that such matter was closed.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply in the future with Nasdaq's Board Independence Rule, Audit Committee Composition Rule, Bid Price Rule or other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. See Our Significant Stockholders May Take Unilateral Actions, below. If the Company fails to satisfy the applicable continued listing requirement again in the future, Nasdaq may commence delisting procedures against the Company (during which the Company may have additional time of up to six (6) months to appeal and correct its non-compliance). If the SGRP Common Stock shares were ultimately delisted by Nasdaq, trading of the SGRP Common Stock could be limited to \"over-the-counter\" trades and the market liquidity of the SGRP Common Stock could be adversely affected, which could result in a decrease in the market price of the SGRP Common Stock due to (among other things) the potential for increased spreads between bids and asks, lower trading volumes and reporting delays in over-the-counter trades and the negative implications and perceptions that could arise from such a delisting.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if the SGRP Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is traded on the over-the-counter market, the \"penny stock\" rules, if applicable, could adversely affect the market price of the SGRP Common Stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has adopted specific rules regulating \"penny stock\", including additional risk disclosure requirements by broker dealers. If applicable in the future, the penny stock rules may also restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell the SGRP Common Stock and may adversely affect the ability of investors to sell their shares.\nWe have inherent risk of failure to maintain effective internal controls.\nEstablishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosures are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial and other reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted and applicable securities and other laws in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial and other reporting are not intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company could prevent or detect a misstatement of its financial statements or other reports or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial and disclosure reporting could limit the Company's ability to report its financial results and file its other reports accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial or disclosure reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial or other reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and a decline in the market price of the SGRP Common Stock.\nOur business is dependent on client payments, business performance and broad economic shifts, and we may be at risk of liquidity constraints and not satisfying all of our credit facility covenants.\nOur business and cash flow can be adversely affected by adverse changes in our client payments, our business performance and broad economic shifts. There can be no assurances that in the future the Company will not violate covenants of its current or future credit facilities; and if it does violate them, that the Company's lenders will waive any violations of such covenants affecting the Company's ability to maintain adequate lines of credit or sufficient availability under its lines of credit. Accordingly, minimal profitability by the Company, additional one-time charges and changes in the composition and quality of its borrowing base, as well as any failure to maintain sufficient availability or lines of credit from the Company's lenders (which may involve their subjective judgement), could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition, whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nOur business and stock liquidity and market value could be adversely affected if we settle outstanding litigation by making payments or issuing common stock.\nThe timing, size and success of litigation settlement efforts and any associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted. Future litigation settlements may be financed by issuing shares of the SGRP Common Stock, cash or a combination thereof. If the SGRP Common Stock does not maintain a sufficient market value, or if potential litigants are otherwise unwilling to accept the SGRP Common Stock as part of the consideration for the settlement of their litigation, the Company may be required to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings. To the extent the SGRP Common Stock is used for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid for legal settlements, dilution may be experienced by existing stockholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing it may need for litigation settlements on terms that the Company deems acceptable. Failure to obtain such capital would materially and adversely affect the Company or its performance or condition. There also can be no assurance that the other parties in any settlement will abide by the terms or any settlement or any related releases. See Item 3 -- Legal Proceedings, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Overview, and Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions Domestic Related Party Services (including Change of Control, Voting and Restricted Stock Agreement), below.\nOur business performance is connected to the experience and retention of key executives.\nThe business strategy, client relationships and operating knowledge are critical to the Company\u2019s long-term success. We believe we have attracted and developed the most experienced and proven executive leadership team in the industry. However, we work in a competitive industry where talent is visible and other companies may approach and attract our key executives. We continuously review the terms and incentives for our executives to retain them and competitively compensate them to deliver industry leading results on behalf of all shareholders.\nOur significant stockholders may take actions, subject to the restrictions of the Change of Control, Voting and Restricted Stock Agreement (\u201cCIC Agreement\u201d) and our By-Laws.\nThe Company's co-founders, Mr. Robert G. Brown and Mr. William H. Bartels, are significant stockholders (\u201cSignificant Stockholders\u201d) and Directors of SGRP and together with certain related parties (collectively, the \"Majority Stockholders\") beneficially own approximately 43.4% of the SGRP Common Stock and could acquire more. That amount was calculated using their respective individual beneficial ownership, excluding affiliates shares, on January 28, 2022, as they represented in the CIC Agreement and the total outstanding ownership (approximately 21.3 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock on a non-diluted basis as of December 31, 2021. Assuming no other purchases or sales, after the vesting of their Series B Preferred Stock and its conversion into SGRP Common Stock in accordance with the CIC Agreement, the Significant Stockholders will together beneficially own approximately 50.4% of the SGRP Common Stock, excluding affiliates shares. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Overview, below.\nAs significant stockholders, the Majority Stockholders can have an impact on the election of directors and the passage of other shareholder meeting proposals.\nThere is inherit business risk for a joint venture business structure.\nThe Company's growth strategy for the international markets has been to join forces with local investors having merchandising service expertise, and combine their knowledge of the local market with the Company's proprietary software and expertise in the merchandising business through joint venture business structure. Currently, of the 9 countries the Company conducting businesses in, 6 of the countries are under a joint venture business structure (Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, China, Australia and India). The Company also has begun to use the model in the United States in recent years and formed two joint ventures, National Merchandising Services, LLC (NMS) and Resource Plus Inc. (RPI), domestically.\nThe Company owns 51% of these joint ventures in all cases; the principal of our local minority investors generally is the Chief Executive Officer, and each joint venture is governed by a Board comprised of directors from both parties. All joint ventures are also governed under the Company\u2019s policies and guidelines.\nThe Company believes its relationship with the joint venture partners are strong. However, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage through inherent business risk due to significant misalignment of business objectives. Any cancellation, nonperformance or material changes of the joint venture partnership could have a material adverse effect of the Company.\nWe have inherent risks operating international businesses.\nThe Company operates in 9 countries around the world. There can be no assurances that the respective business environments will remain favorable. In the future, the Company's International operations and sales may be affected by the following risks, which may adversely affect United States companies doing business in foreign countries:\n\u25cf Political and economic risks, including terrorist attacks and political instability;\n\u25cf Various forms of protectionist trade legislation that currently exist or have been proposed;\n\u25cf Expenses associated with customizing services and technology;\n\u25cf Local laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u25cf Dependence on local vendors and potential for undisclosed related party transactions;\n\u25cf Multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations and enforcement;\n\u25cf Potentially adverse tax and employment law consequences;\n\u25cf Local accounting principles, practices and procedures;\n\u25cf Local legal principles, practices and procedures, local contract review and negotiation, and limited familiarity with contract issues (excessive warranties, extra-territoriality, sweeping intellectual property claims and the like);\n\u25cf Limited familiarity or an unwillingness to comply with, or wrongly believing the inapplicability of, generally accepted accounting principles in the USA (\"GAAP\"), applicable corporate controls and policies of the Company (including its ethics code), or applicable law in the USA (including Nasdaq rules, securities laws, anti-terrorism law, Sarbanes Oxley and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) by Local Investors;\n\u25cf Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the export of funds;\n\u25cf Substantial communication barriers, including those arising from language, culture, custom and time zones; and\n\u25cf Supervisory challenges arising from agreements, distance, physical absences and such communication barriers.\nIf any developments should occur with respect to any of those international risks and materially and adversely affect the Company's applicable international subsidiary, such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition.", "PERMNO": 83303, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "SGRP"}
