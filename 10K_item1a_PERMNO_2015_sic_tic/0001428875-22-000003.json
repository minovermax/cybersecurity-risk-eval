RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors are important to understanding the contents of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and of other reports. Our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones relevant to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into five groups: risks related to our business and our industry, risks related to our indebtedness, risks related to our common stock, risks related to COVID-19 and risks related to the proposed acquisition by Rentokil.\nThe materialization of any risks and uncertainties set forth below or identified in forward-looking statements contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur industry is highly competitive. Competition could reduce our market share and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Changes in the source and intensity of competition within the industry may impact the demand for our services and may also result in additional pricing pressure. Regional and local competitors operating in a limited geographic area may have lower labor, teammate benefits and overhead costs than us. The principal methods of competition in our business include quality and speed of customer service, brand awareness and reputation, technology and systems, customer satisfaction, fairness of contract terms, including price and promotions, professional sales forces, contractor network and referrals. We may be unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and the competitive pressures that we face may result in reduced share, reduced pricing or an adverse impact to our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeakening general economic conditions, especially as they may affect home sales, unemployment or consumer confidence or spending levels, may adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations are dependent upon consumer spending. Deterioration in general economic conditions and consumer confidence, particularly in California, Texas and Florida, which collectively represented approximately one-third of our revenue in 2021, could affect the demand for our services. Consumer spending and confidence tend to decline during times of declining economic conditions. A worsening of macroeconomic indicators, including weak home sales, higher home foreclosures, declining consumer confidence or rising unemployment rates, could adversely affect consumer spending levels, reduce demand for our services and adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTermite damage claims and lawsuits related thereto could increase our legal expenses and may adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to a significant number of damage claims related to termite activity in homes for which we provide termite control services, often accompanied by a termite damage warranty. Our termite damage warranty is a differentiator in the industry that has enabled us to become the market leader of this product line. Damage claims include circumstances when a customer notifies us that they have experienced damage and we reach an agreement to remediate that damage (a \u201cNon-litigated Claim\u201d); and circumstances when we do not reach an agreement with a customer to remediate the damage and that customer initiates litigation or arbitration proceedings (a \u201cLitigated Claim\u201d). Recently we have experienced higher Non-litigated Claim activity concentrated in our branches in Mobile, Alabama and Gulf Shores, Alabama, which comprise all of our customers in the area, (collectively, the \u201cMobile Bay Area\u201d) related to Formosan termites, an invasive species, which has driven higher Non-litigated Claims expense. In addition, since the beginning of 2017, we have been served with an increasing number of Litigated Claims, again primarily concentrated in the Mobile Bay Area and related to Formosan termite activity, which has driven higher Litigated Claims expense. Some plaintiffs have sought to demonstrate a pattern and practice of fraud in connection with Litigated Claims and have sought awards, in addition to repair costs, which included punitive damages and damages for mental anguish. We defend these Litigated Claims vigorously, and we are taking decisive actions to mitigate increasing claims costs, however, we cannot give assurance that these mitigation actions will be effective in reducing claims or costs related thereto, nor can we give assurance that lawsuits or other proceedings related to termite damage claims will not materially affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn November 2020, the Company entered into the Consent Judgment and Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement\u201d) with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Alabama (the \u201cAL AG\u201d) and other Alabama state regulators, primarily related to our termite renewal pricing changes we made in the Mobile Bay area in 2019 and certain other termite inspection and treatment practices regarding the control of Formosan termites in that area that allegedly violated the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act (the \u201cADTPA\u201d). The Settlement provides for: immediate remediation measures to be provided directly to current and former customers in the Mobile Bay Area, including refunds of certain price increases, rebates to certain former customers, the establishment of a $25 million consumer fund and a related receiver to oversee our compliance with these commitments and to act as an arbitrator for certain Non-litigated Claims; the reimbursement of certain investigative and monitoring costs incurred by the AL AG\u2019s office and the Department of Agriculture and Industries; and a university endowment intended to support termite and pest management research with an emphasis on Formosan termite research. The Company has also paid the state of Alabama $19 million. In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded charges of $4 million and $49 million, respectively, and a reduction of revenue of $4 million was recorded in December 2020 related to these remediation measures.\nPursuant to the Settlement, we have also agreed to provide the opportunity to reinstate service for customers who canceled their services during certain specified timeframes as well as the retreatment of certain customer premises and a commitment to certain specified response and remediation timeframes for future termite damage claims. The financial impact of these remedies did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe entered into the Settlement, in part, because after consultation with Alabama legal counsel and a review of the relevant statutes and case law, the Settlement provides us with a preclusivity position to negate punitive damage awards related to future Litigated Claims in the Mobile Bay Area. The validity of the preclusivity position related to future Litigated Claims of fraud, misrepresentation, deceit, suppression of material facts or fraudulent concealment arising out of any act, occurrence or transaction related to our Formosan termite business practices in the Mobile Bay Area has experienced limited testing in legal proceedings with our fact scenarios and could fail to negate awards of punitive damages in future legal proceedings.\nWe remain in compliance with the Settlement and do not expect to incur additional material expenses related to the settlement in future periods.\nOn April 22, 2021, the State of Mississippi brought litigation against us related to our termite inspection and treatment practices. The Company disputes the claims made in the litigation and intends to defend the matter vigorously. However, given the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the case, and the legal standards that must be met for success on the merits, the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of the Mississippi litigation.\nWe may not successfully implement our business strategies, including achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may not be able to fully implement our business strategies or realize, in whole or in part within the expected time frames, the anticipated benefits of various growth or other initiatives. Our business strategies and initiatives, including growth of our customer base, introduction of new service and product offerings, geographic expansion and enhancement of profitability, are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe will incur certain costs to achieve efficiency improvements, systems implementations and growth in our business, and we may not meet anticipated implementation timetables or stay within budgeted costs. As these efficiency improvements, system implementations and growth initiatives are implemented, we may not fully achieve expected cost savings and efficiency improvements, system implementations or growth rates, or these initiatives could adversely impact customer retention or our operations. Also, our business strategies may change in light of our ability to implement new business initiatives, competitive pressures, economic uncertainties or developments or other factors.\nAdverse credit and financial market events and conditions could, among other things, impede access to or increase the cost of financing, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDisruptions in credit or financial markets could make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our proposed indebtedness, or cause the proposed lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and not give technical or other waivers under credit facility or other agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future, thereby causing us to be in default. Market changes in the real estate segment could also affect the demand for our services as home buyers elect not to purchase our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions and seasonality affect the demand for our services and our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe demand for our services and our results of operations are affected by weather conditions, including, without limitation, potential impacts, if any, from climate change, known and unknown, and by the seasonal nature of our termite and pest management services. Adverse weather conditions (e.g., cooler temperatures or droughts), whether created by climate change factors or otherwise, can impede the development of termite swarms and lead to lower demand for our termite control services. Extreme or unpredictable weather conditions could materially adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in raw material prices, fuel prices and other operating costs could adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by increases in the level of our operating expenses, such as fuel, chemicals, raw materials, wages and salaries, teammate benefits, health care, vehicle maintenance, building materials, contractor costs, self-insurance costs and other insurance premiums, as well as various regulatory compliance costs, all of which may be subject to inflationary pressures.\nFuel prices are subject to market volatility. Our fleet has been negatively impacted by significant increases in fuel prices in the past and could be negatively impacted in the future. Previous increases in fuel prices increased our costs of operating vehicles and equipment. There can be no assurances that rates will not fluctuate materially in future years. We cannot predict what effect global events could have on fuel prices, but it is possible that such events could lead to higher fuel prices. Although we hedge a significant portion of our fuel costs, we do not hedge all of those costs. We expect to use approximately 9.5 million to 11 million gallons of fuel in 2022. Fuel price increases can also result in increases in the cost of chemicals and other materials used in our business. We cannot predict the extent to which we may experience future increases in costs of fuel, chemicals, and equipment, parts, raw materials, wages and salaries, teammate benefits, health care, vehicle maintenance, contractor costs, self-insurance costs and other insurance premiums, as well as various regulatory compliance costs and other operating costs. To the extent such costs increase, we may be prevented, in whole or in part, from passing these cost increases through to our existing and prospective customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified key executives or transition smoothly to new leadership, which could adversely impact us and our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nThe execution of our business strategy and our financial performance will continue to depend in significant part on our executive management team and other key management teammates. Any inability to attract in a timely manner qualified executives, retain our leadership team and recruit other important teammates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with, or violation of, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws pertaining to the use of pesticides, could result in significant costs that adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nInternational, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters affect us in several ways. In the U.S., products containing pesticides generally must be registered with the EPA, and similar state agencies before they can be sold or applied. The failure to obtain, or the cancellation of, any such registration, or the withdrawal from the marketplace of such pesticides, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on the products involved, whether other products could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. The pesticides we use are manufactured by independent third parties and are evaluated by the EPA as part of its ongoing exposure risk assessment. The EPA may decide that a pesticide we use will be limited or will not be re-registered for use in the U.S. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the EPA\u2019s continuing evaluations.\nIn addition, the use of certain pesticide products is regulated by various international, federal, state, provincial and local environmental and public health agencies. Although we strive to comply with such laws and regulations and have processes in place designed to achieve compliance, given our dispersed locations, distributed operations and numerous teammates and franchise associates, we may be unable to prevent violations of these or other laws and regulations from occurring. Even if we are able to comply with all such laws and regulations and obtain all necessary registrations and licenses, the pesticides or other products we apply or use, or the manner in which we apply or use them, could be alleged to cause injury to the environment, to people or to animals, or such products could be banned in certain circumstances. The laws and regulations may also apply to third-party vendors who are hired to repair or remediate property and who may fail to comply with environmental laws, health and safety laws and regulations and subject us to risk of legal exposure. The costs of compliance, non-compliance, investigation, remediation, combating reputational harm or defending civil or criminal proceedings, products liability, personal injury or other lawsuits could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nInternational, federal, state, provincial and local agencies regulate the disposal, handling and storage of waste, discharges from our facilities and the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur significant costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, fines, penalties and civil or criminal sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, these laws and regulations. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nOn January 20, 2017, Terminix International USVI, LLC (\u201cTMX USVI\u201d) and The Terminix International Company Limited Partnership (\u201cTMX LP\u201d), each an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a revised Plea Agreement (the \u201cPlea Agreement\u201d) in connection with the investigation initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice Environmental Crimes Section (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) into allegations that a local Terminix branch used methyl bromide as a fumigant at a resort in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. Under the terms of sentencing handed down on November 20, 2017, in addition to fines paid and reimbursement of clean-up costs, both TMX USVI and TMX LP will serve a five-year probation period ending in November 2022.\nPublic perceptions that the products we use and the services we deliver are not environmentally friendly or safe may adversely impact the demand for our services.\nIn providing our services, we use, among other things, pesticides and other chemicals. Public perception that the products we use and the services we deliver are not environmentally friendly or safe or are harmful to humans or animals, whether justified or not, or our improper application of these chemicals, could reduce demand for our services, increase regulation or government restrictions or actions, result in fines or penalties, impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brand names and otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nLaws and government regulations applicable to our business and lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities could increase our legal and regulatory expenses, and impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to significant international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection, wage and hour requirements, franchising, the employment of immigrants, labor relations, permitting and licensing, building code requirements, workers\u2019 safety, the environment, insurance coverages, sales tax collection and remittance, teammate benefits, marketing (including, without limitation, telemarketing) and advertising, the application and use of pesticides and other chemicals. In particular, we anticipate that various international, federal, state, provincial and local governing bodies may propose additional legislation and regulation that may be detrimental to our business or may substantially increase our operating costs, including increases in the minimum wage; environmental regulations related to chemical use, climate change and other environmental matters; health care coverage; or \u201cdo-not-call\u201d or other marketing regulations.\nWe are also subject to various consumer protection laws and subject to receiving inquiries or investigative demands by regulatory bodies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state attorneys general and other state agencies. It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and changes to such requirements may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if we were to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer harm to our reputation, suffer the loss of licenses or incur penalties that may affect how our business is operated, which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on labor availability at our customer care centers and branches.\nOur ability to conduct our operations is in part affected by our ability to increase our labor force, including on a seasonal basis at our customer care centers, which may be adversely affected by a number of factors. The ongoing labor shortage is challenging for all companies in the U.S. and we could be forced to increase wages to attract and retain teammates, which would result in higher operating costs and reduced profitability and could make it more difficult for us in responding to customer calls in a timely fashion or delivering our services in a high-quality or timely manner. Long wait times by customers during peak operating times could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDecisions and rules by the National Labor Relations Board, including \u201cexpedited elections\u201d and restrictions on appeals, could lead to increased organizing activities at our subsidiaries or franchisees. If these labor organizing activities were successful, it could further increase labor costs, decrease operating efficiency and productivity in the future, or otherwise disrupt or negatively impact our operations. In addition, potential competition from key teammates who leave Terminix could impact our ability to maintain our share in certain geographic areas.\nOur franchisees, subcontractors, third-party distributors and vendors could take actions that could harm our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, $12 million of our consolidated revenue was received in the form of franchise revenues while $11 million of our consolidated revenue was received in the form of franchise revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We estimate customer level revenue of our franchisees was $386 million, $369 million and $372 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our franchisees, subcontractors, third-party distributors and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them. However, franchisees, subcontractors, third-party distributors and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control, and who own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses. As a result, the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with regulatory standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and our brands\u2019 image and reputation could be harmed. Similarly, if third-party distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third-party distributors, subcontractors, vendors and franchisees. In addition, our relationship with our franchisees, third-party distributors, subcontractors and vendors could become strained (including resulting in litigation) and these strains in our relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints, disputes or questions about our practices and standards. If franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us, we would vigorously defend against the claims in any such proceeding, but our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted and the price of our common stock could decline.\nDisruptions or failures in our information technology systems could create liability for us or limit our ability to effectively monitor, operate and control our operations and adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor, operate and control our operations. Changes or modifications to our information technology systems could cause disruption to our operations or cause challenges with respect to our compliance with laws, regulations or other applicable standards. As the development and implementation of our information technology systems (including our operating systems) evolve, we may elect to modify, replace or abandon certain technology initiatives, which could result in write-downs.\nAny disruption in our information technology systems, including capacity limitations, instabilities, or failure to operate as expected, could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, including by limiting our capacity to monitor, operate and control our operations effectively. Failures of our information technology systems could also lead to violations of privacy laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices related to our customers and teammates. If our disaster recovery plans do not work as anticipated, or if the third-party vendors to which we have outsourced certain information technology, customer care center or other services fail to fulfill their obligations to us, our operations may be adversely affected, and any of these circumstances could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience difficulties implementing our new customer experience platform.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new system that will integrate all legacy operating systems onto a single platform accessible by all. The new system will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the system, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the system could adversely affect our ability to process work orders, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. In addition, our efforts to centralize various business processes within our organization in connection with this implementation may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the services we deliver or the products we use could affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and future plans.\nOur financial performance is affected by changes in the services and products we offer to customers, including termite warranties. There can be no assurance that our strategies or product offerings will succeed in increasing revenue and growing profitability. An unsuccessful execution of strategies, including the rollout or adjustment of our new services or products, the effectiveness of sales and marketing plans and our handling of cases and claims for termite damages, particularly in the Mobile Bay Area, could cause us to reevaluate or change our business strategies and could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and future plans.\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, teammates and third parties, we could be subject to interruption of our business operations, private litigation, reputational damage and costly penalties.\nWe rely on, among other things, commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information of customers, teammates and third parties, such as payment cards and personal information. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are central to meeting standards set by the payment card industry (\u201cPCI\u201d). We continue to evaluate and modify these systems and protocols for PCI compliance purposes, and such PCI standards may change from time to time. Activities by third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of these systems. Any compromises, breaches or errors in applications related to these systems or failures to comply with standards set by the PCI could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations, including customers\u2019 ability to pay for services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations, orders, industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs, penalties and liabilities. We are subject to risks caused by data breaches and operational disruptions, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists. The frequency of data breaches of companies and governments have increased in recent years as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to proprietary information, service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names, Terminix, Copesan, Assured Environments, Gregory, McCloud and Nomor. We have not sought to register or protect every one of our marks either in the U.S. or in every country in which they are or may be used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the U.S. If we are unable to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights, including brand names, it could cause a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products, services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights.\nFuture acquisitions or other strategic transactions could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may pursue strategic transactions in the future, which could involve acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets. Any future strategic transaction could involve integration or implementation challenges, business disruption or other risks, or change our business profile significantly. Any inability on our part to consolidate and manage growth from acquired business or successfully implement other strategic transactions could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any acquisition that we make may not provide us with the benefits that were anticipated when entering into such acquisition. The process of integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen difficulties and expenses, including the diversion of resources needed to integrate new businesses, technologies, products, teammates or systems; the inability to retain teammates, customers and suppliers; the assumption of actual or contingent liabilities (including those relating to the environment); failure to effectively and timely adopt and adhere to our internal control processes and other policies; write-offs or impairment charges relating to goodwill and other intangible assets; unanticipated liabilities relating to acquired businesses; and potential expense associated with litigation with sellers of such businesses. Any future disposition transactions could also impact our business and may subject us to various risks, including failure to obtain appropriate value for the disposed businesses, post-closing claims being levied against us and disruption to our business during the sale process or thereafter.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges.\nWe have significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, such as trade names. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment, including:\n\uf0b7significant adverse changes in the business climate, including economic or financial conditions;\n\uf0b7significant adverse changes in expected operating results;\n\uf0b7adverse actions or assessments by regulators;\n\uf0b7unanticipated competition;\n\uf0b7loss of key teammates; and\n\uf0b7a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of.\nBased upon future economic and financial market conditions, the operating performance of the Company and other factors, including those listed above, we may incur impairment charges in the future. It is possible that such impairment, if required, could be material. Any future impairment charges that we are required to record could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various restrictive covenants that could materially adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we enter into noncompetition agreements or other restrictive covenants (e.g., exclusivity, take or pay and non-solicitation obligations), including in connection with business dispositions or strategic contracts, that restrict us from entering into lines of business or operating in certain geographic areas into which we may desire to expand our business. We also are subject to various non-solicitation and no-hire covenants that may restrict our ability to solicit potential customers or teammates. If we do not comply with such restrictive covenants, or if a dispute arises regarding the scope and interpretation thereof, litigation could ensue, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, to the extent that such restrictive covenants prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nOur business process outsourcing initiatives have increased our reliance on third-party vendors and may expose our business to harm upon the termination or disruption of our third-party vendor relationships.\nOur strategy to increase profitability, in part, by reducing our costs of operations includes the implementation of certain business process outsourcing initiatives. Any disruption, termination or substandard performance of these outsourced services, including possible breaches by third-party vendors of their agreements with us, could adversely affect our brands, reputation, customer relationships, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Also, to the extent a third-party outsourcing provider relationship is terminated, there is a risk of disputes or litigation and that we may not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider in a timely manner or on terms that we consider favorable, and even if we find an alternate provider, or choose to insource such services, there are significant risks associated with any transitioning activities. In addition, to the extent we decide to terminate outsourcing services and insource such services, there is a risk that we may not have the capabilities to perform these services internally, resulting in a disruption to our business, which could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We could incur costs, including teammate and equipment costs, to insource previously outsourced services like these, and these costs could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could impact our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $899 million of total consolidated long-term indebtedness, including the current portion of long-term debt, outstanding, and $22 million of letters of credit outstanding and $378 million of available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility maturing November 4, 2024 (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). The agreements governing our $600 million Term Loan Facility maturing November 4, 2026 (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) and the Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to (i) transfer or sell assets, (ii) create liens and (iii) enter into agreements restricting dividends or other distributions by our subsidiaries.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing the Credit Facilities and the instruments governing our other indebtedness may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control including credit or capital market disruptions. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay indebtedness, lenders having secured obligations, such as the lenders under the Credit Facilities, could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under the Credit Facilities and may not be able to repay the amounts due under such facilities or our other outstanding indebtedness. This could have serious consequences to our financial position and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings, outlook or watch assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nOur indebtedness has primarily non-investment grade ratings, and any rating, outlook or watch assigned to our debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, current or future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, outlook or watch, such as adverse changes to our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings, outlook or watch likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the instruments governing our indebtedness do not prohibit us or fully prohibit our subsidiaries from doing so. The Credit Facilities permit additional borrowings beyond the committed amounts under certain circumstances. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks we face would increase, and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nTerminix Global Holdings, Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own, and it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses, including to make future dividend payments, if any.\nTerminix\u2019s operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to fund our operations and expenses, to pay dividends or to meet debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flows of our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that Terminix needs funds, and its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe currently intend to use our future earnings to fund our growth, to develop our business, repay debt, make acquisitions, and for working capital needs and general corporate purposes. Any future determination to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. To the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\uf0b7the proposed acquisition by Rentokil;\n\uf0b7industry or general market conditions;\n\uf0b7domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\uf0b7lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\uf0b7changes in our customers\u2019 preferences;\n\uf0b7new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\uf0b7changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts;\n\uf0b7action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders;\n\uf0b7failure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices;\n\uf0b7announcements by us of significant impairment charges;\n\uf0b7speculation in the press or investment community;\n\uf0b7investor perception of us and our industry;\n\uf0b7changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\uf0b7announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships;\n\uf0b7war, terrorist acts and epidemic disease;\n\uf0b7any future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\uf0b7additions or departures of key teammates.\nThe stock markets have experienced volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn July 2014, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock to be issued under our equity compensation plans and, as a result, all shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of (i) stock options granted under these plans and (ii) other equity based awards granted under the Amended and Restated Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (\u201cOmnibus Incentive Plan\u201d).\nOn February 24, 2015, our board of directors approved and recommended for approval by our stockholders the Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\u201d), which became effective for offering periods commencing July 1, 2015. On April 27, 2015, our stockholders approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan with a maximum of one million shares of common stock authorized for sale under the plan. In connection with the announcement of the proposed acquisition of the Company by Rentokil, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was suspended as of January 1, 2022.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts that covers our common stock downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of the analysts ceases coverage of our common stock or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities which would rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws collectively:\n\uf0b7authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\uf0b7provide for a classified board of directors, which divides our board of directors into three classes, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting;\n\uf0b7limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors;\n\uf0b7provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\uf0b7prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\uf0b7prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\uf0b7establish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders; and\n\uf0b7require the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend our amended and restated by-laws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, teammates or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our Company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nOur operations may be adversely impacted as a result of pandemic outbreaks, including COVID-19.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and by March 11, 2020, as COVID-19 spread outside of China, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic could have negative impacts on our operations, major facilities or teammates\u2019 and consumers\u2019 health. As the global pandemic and its negative impact on the global economy continue, we expect COVID-19 to continue to interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have experienced and may continue to experience customer shutdowns, increased medical claims for our teammates, and supply chain disruptions related to COVID-19. To the extent that COVID-19 continues or worsens, governments may impose new or additional restrictions to slow its spread. The result of COVID-19 and those restrictions could result in additional businesses being shut down, additional work restrictions and supply chains being further interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable. As a result, it may be challenging to obtain raw materials to support our business needs, and individuals could become ill, quarantined or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. Also, governments may impose other laws, regulations or taxes which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if our customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us.\nThe potential effects of COVID-19 also could impact us in a number of other ways including, but not limited to, reductions to our profitability, laws and regulations affecting our business, fluctuations in foreign currency markets, the availability of future borrowings, the cost of borrowings, credit risks of our customers and counterparties, and potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such increased costs and reductions in profitability may not be fully recoverable. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition or results of operation, but the impact could be material over time.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Acquisition by Rentokil\nThe completion of the Mergers is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approvals as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when they may be completed.\nThe respective obligations of the Company and Rentokil to consummate the Mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of customary conditions, including: (1) the approval of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders; (2) approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and other related matters by Rentokil\u2019s shareholders; (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting consummation of the Mergers; (4) Rentokil\u2019s registration statement on Form having been declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; (5) Rentokil\u2019s shareholder circular and prospectus having been approved by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority; (6) the Rentokil ADSs issuable in the Mergers (and the Rentokil Ordinary Shares represented thereby) having been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange; (7) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d); (8) accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (9) compliance by the other party in all material respects with such other party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement. In addition, the obligation of Rentokil to consummate the Mergers is subject to completion by the Company of the sale or disposition of certain of its existing businesses. If these conditions are not satisfied (or waived, if applicable) by certain dates specified in the Merger Agreement, either company will have a right to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances.\nThe governmental authorities from which authorizations under antitrust and foreign investment laws, including the HSR Act are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the Mergers, including other potential transactions in our industry or other industries. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the Mergers. As a condition to authorization of the Mergers or related transactions, these governmental authorities also may seek to impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of Rentokil\u2019s business after completion of the Mergers.\nWe can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable) in a timely manner or at all, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are timely satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Mergers. Many of the conditions to completion of the Mergers are not within either our or Rentokil\u2019s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the Mergers could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Mergers are successfully completed within its expected timeframe.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the Mergers are not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement or Rentokil shareholders failing to approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we will remain an independent public company. Our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\uf0b7we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of our common stock, and from our customers, suppliers, regulators and teammates;\n\uf0b7we may be required to pay Rentokil a termination fee of $200 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including because (1) Rentokil has terminated the Merger Agreement due to the fact that our board of directors has changed its recommendation in favor of the Mergers, (2) we have terminated the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement providing for a Company Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or (3) the Company has entered into an agreement providing for a Company Superior Proposal within twelve months following the termination of the Merger Agreement, in certain circumstances;\n\uf0b7we may be required to make a payment to Rentokil equal to $50 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated because our stockholders fail to adopt the Merger Agreement;\n\uf0b7the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Mergers, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Rentokil, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, entering into or amending certain contracts, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Mergers that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and\n\uf0b7matters relating to the Mergers (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIf any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nCombining Rentokil and the Company may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers.\nThe success of the Mergers will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, and cost savings from combining the businesses of Rentokil and the Company. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the Mergers, Rentokil and the Company must integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized, without adversely affecting current revenues and future growth. If Rentokil and the Company are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Mergers could be less than anticipated, the costs associated with effecting the Mergers may be more than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results and financial condition of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company after the completion of the Mergers.\nRentokil and the Company have operated and, until the completion of the Mergers, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key associates, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and other business parties or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Mergers. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on Rentokil and/or the Company during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Mergers on the combined company.\nBecause the Merger Consideration will include a fixed number of American depositary shares of Rentokil, each such share represents a beneficial interest in five Rentokil ordinary shares and the market price of Rentokil ordinary shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, our stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the Merger Consideration they will receive in the Mergers.\nThe market value of the consideration our stockholders will receive in the Mergers will fluctuate with the market price of Rentokil\u2019s ordinary shares. Based on Rentokil\u2019s five-day average daily volume weighted share price and the five-day average of the Sterling-US Dollar exchange rate, in each case, over the period spanning December 6, 2021 to December 10, 2021, inclusive, the implied value of the merger consideration to our stockholders was approximately $55.00 per share of our common stock, and such implied value has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Mergers and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K until the date the Mergers are completed, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the date hereof. Rentokil\u2019s ordinary share price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in Rentokil\u2019s and the Company\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, risks inherent in the respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood that the Mergers will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the Mergers, and changes with respect to expectations regarding the timing of the Mergers and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nIn addition, upon completion of the Mergers, certain holders of our common stock who receive Rentokil ADSs in the Mergers will become holders of shares of Rentokil ordinary shares. The businesses of Rentokil differ from those of the Company in important respects, and, accordingly, the results of operations of Rentokil after the Mergers, as well as the market price of Rentokil ordinary shares, may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the results of operations of the Company.\nWhile the Mergers are pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of teammates, customers, collaborators or suppliers.\nThe Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business until the earlier of the completion of the Mergers or termination of the Merger Agreement. For example, unless we obtain Rentokil\u2019s prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), we may not, subject to certain exceptions and aggregate limitations, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of our common stock outside of our equity incentive plans, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends, acquire assets, securities or property, dispose of businesses or assets, enter into material contracts or make certain additional capital expenditures. We may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement delay or prevent us from responding, or limit our ability to respond, effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management believes they may be advisable. The pendency of the Mergers may also divert management\u2019s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations.\nOur teammates, customers, and suppliers may experience uncertainties about the effects of the Mergers. It is possible that some customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the Mergers. Similarly, current and prospective teammates may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the Mergers, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key teammates. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact our operating results, financial position and/or cash flows and/or our stock price.\nLawsuits may be filed against us and/or Rentokil challenging the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may delay or prevent the proposed Mergers from being completed.\nLawsuits arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement, Rentokil\u2019s registration statement on Form (which will include a document that serves as a prospectus of Rentokil and a proxy statement of the Company) and/or the proposed acquisition of us by Rentokil may be filed in the future. One of the conditions to completion of the Mergers is the absence of any injunction or other order being in effect that prohibits completion of the Mergers. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction, then such order may prevent the proposed Mergers from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key teammates in light of the Mergers.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Mergers on our teammates may have an adverse effect on our business. This uncertainty may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key teammates. Teammate retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Mergers, as our teammates may experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined business. No assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key teammates to the same extent that we have been able to attract or retain teammates in the past.\n\u200e", "PERMNO": 14750, "SIC": 7340, "TIC": "SERV"}
