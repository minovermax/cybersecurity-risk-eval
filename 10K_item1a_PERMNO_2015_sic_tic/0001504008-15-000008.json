{"cik": "1504008", "company": "BankUnited, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nMarkets and economic conditions in the United States have generally improved from the economic downturn at the end of the last decade. Although real estate prices, unemployment rates and other economic indicators have improved, they have yet to return to pre-downturn levels. The potential for economic disruption continues and there can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve. A slowing of improvement or a return to deteriorating business or economic conditions generally, or more specifically in the principal markets in which we do business, could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nA decrease in demand for our loan and deposit products;\n\u2022\nAn increase in delinquencies and defaults by borrowers or counterparties;\n\u2022\nA decrease in the value of our assets;\n\u2022\nA decrease in earnings; and\n\u2022\nA decrease in our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.\nOur enterprise risk management framework is designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management framework in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is highly susceptible to credit risk on our non-covered assets.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing the payment of their loans, if any, may be insufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. To a lesser extent, we have credit risk embedded in our securities portfolio. Our credit standards, procedures and policies may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses, particularly if economic or market conditions deteriorate. It is difficult to determine the many ways in which a decline in economic or market conditions may impact the credit quality of our assets. The Loss Sharing Agreements only cover certain legacy assets, and credit losses on assets not covered by the Loss Sharing Agreements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses (\"ALLL\") that represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in our credit portfolio. This estimate requires management to make significant assumptions and involves a high degree of judgment, particularly as our new loan portfolio has not yet developed an observable loss trend. Management considers numerous factors in determining the amount of the ALLL, including, but not limited to, internal risk ratings, loss forecasts, collateral values, delinquency rates, historical loss severities, the level of non-performing and restructured loans in the loan portfolio, product mix, underwriting practices, credit administration, portfolio trends, industry conditions, economic trends and net charge-off trends. The effects of any decreases in expected cash flows on covered loans are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses.\nIf management's assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may be insufficient and we may be required to increase our ALLL. In addition, regulatory authorities periodically review our ALLL and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Adverse economic conditions could make management's estimate even more complex and difficult to determine. Any increase in our ALLL will result in a decrease in net income and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Analysis of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\"\nOur business is susceptible to interest rate risk.\nOur business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates. Since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing, changes in rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates can have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities. Changes in the value of investment securities available for sale directly impact equity through adjustments of accumulated other comprehensive income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately, including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board.\nOur earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The current low level of market interest rates limits our ability to add higher yielding assets to the balance sheet. If this prolonged period of low rates continues beyond current forecasts, it may exacerbate downward pressure on our net interest margin and have a negative impact on our net interest income in the future. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a period of rising rates, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our deposit products, decrease loan repayment rates and negatively affect borrowers' ability to meet their obligations. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits.\nWe attempt to manage interest rate risk by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and through the use of hedging instruments; however, interest rate risk management techniques are not precise, and we may not be able to successfully manage our interest rate risk. Our ability to manage interest rate risk could be negatively impacted by longer fixed rate terms on real estate loans being added to our portfolio. A rapid or unanticipated increase or decrease in interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations.\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in economic conditions in the geographic markets in which our operations are concentrated or in the financial or credit markets in general. Our access to liquidity in the form of deposits may also be affected\nby the liquidity needs of our depositors. A substantial portion of our liabilities consist of deposit accounts that are payable on demand or upon several days' notice, while by comparison, the majority of our assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in executing our fundamental growth strategy.\nGrowth of our business, whether organic or through acquisitions, is an essential component of our business strategy. Commercial and consumer banking in our primary markets is highly competitive. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute our organic growth strategy in these markets.\nWe also compete with other financial institutions for acquisition opportunities and there are a limited number of candidates that meet our acquisition criteria. Consequently, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates for acquisitions. If we are unable to locate suitable acquisition candidates willing to sell on terms acceptable to us, we will not be able to execute a strategy of growth by acquisition.\nIf we do identify suitable candidates and succeed in consummating future acquisitions, acquisitions involve risks that the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flows. There may also be unforeseen liabilities relating to the acquired businesses or arising out of the acquisitions, asset quality problems of the acquired entities, difficulty operating in markets in which we have had no or only limited experience and other conditions not within our control, such as adverse personnel relations, loss of customers because of change in identity, and deterioration in local economic conditions.\nIn addition, the process of integrating acquired entities will divert significant management time and resources. We may not be able to integrate successfully or operate profitably any financial institutions or complementary businesses we may acquire. We may experience disruption and incur unexpected expenses in integrating acquisitions. Any acquisitions we do make may not enhance our cash flows, business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during periods in which the acquisitions are being integrated into our operations.\nLastly, our growth plans are dependent on the availability of capital and funding. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of stock or debt securities may be affected by market conditions, economic conditions or regulatory changes. There is no assurance that sufficient capital or funding will be available in the future, upon acceptable terms or at all.\nFailure to comply with the terms of our Loss Sharing Agreements with the FDIC may result in significant losses.\nA significant portion of BankUnited's revenue continues to be derived from the covered assets. The Loss Sharing Agreements with the FDIC provide that a significant portion of losses related to the covered assets will be borne by the FDIC. Under the Loss Sharing Agreements, we are obligated to comply with certain loan servicing standards, including requirements to participate in government-sponsored loan modification programs. As these standards continue to evolve, we may experience difficulties in complying with the requirements of the Loss Sharing Agreements, which could result in covered assets losing some or all of their coverage. BankUnited's compliance with the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements is subject to audit by the FDIC through its designated agent. The required terms of the agreements are extensive and failure to comply with any of the guidelines could result in a specific asset or group of assets losing their loss sharing coverage. See \"Item 1. Business-The FSB Acquisition.\"\nThe geographic concentration of our markets in the coastal regions of Florida and the New York metropolitan area makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our operations are concentrated in the coastal regions of Florida and the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, a significant portion of our loans secured by real estate are secured by commercial and residential properties in these geographic regions. Accordingly, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans, may be significantly affected by economic conditions in these regions or by changes in the local real estate markets. The Florida economy and our market in particular were affected by the most recent downturn in commercial and residential property values, and the decline in real estate values in Florida during the downturn was higher than the national average. Additionally, the Florida economy relies heavily on tourism and seasonal residents. Disruption or deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nan increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for our products and services; or\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers' borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nHurricanes and other weather-related events, as well as man-made disasters, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe occurrence of a hurricane or other natural disaster to which our markets are susceptible or a man-made catastrophe such as the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill or terrorist activity could disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of collateral and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDelinquencies and defaults in residential mortgages have created a backlog in courts, where subject to judicial foreclosure, and an increase in the amount of legislative action that might restrict or delay our ability to foreclose and hence delay the collection of payments for single family residential loans under the Loss Sharing Agreements.\nFor the single family residential loans covered by the Loss Sharing Agreements, we cannot collect loss share payments until we liquidate the properties securing those loans. These loss share payments could be delayed by an extended foreclosure process, including delays resulting from a court backlog, local or national foreclosure moratoriums or other delays, and these delays could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Homeowner protection laws may also delay the initiation or completion of foreclosure proceedings on specified types of residential mortgage loans. Any such limitations are likely to cause delayed or reduced collections from mortgagors. Any restriction on our ability to foreclose on a loan, any requirement that we forgo a portion of the amount otherwise due on a loan or any requirement that we modify any original loan terms could negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nSince we engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral property and own the underlying real estate, we may be subject to the increased costs and risks associated with the ownership of commercial or residential real property, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by residential or commercial real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans, in which case, we are exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral or local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nenvironmental cleanup liability;\n\u2022\nneighborhood values;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\ncommercial real estate rental and vacancy rates;\n\u2022\nreal estate tax rates;\n\u2022\noperating expenses of the mortgaged properties;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for properties;\n\u2022\nability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties;\n\u2022\nzoning laws;\n\u2022\ngovernmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and\n\u2022\nhurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters.\nThese same factors may impact the ability of borrowers to repay their obligations that are secured by real property.\nThe credit quality of our loan portfolio and results of operations are affected by residential and commercial real estate values and the level of residential and commercial real estate sales and rental activity.\nA material portion of our loans are secured by residential or commercial real estate. The ability of our borrowers to repay their obligations and our financial results may therefore be adversely affected by changes in real estate values. Commercial real estate valuations in particular are highly subjective, as they are based on many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. The properties securing income-producing investor real estate loans may not be fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrowers' ability to repay these loans is dependent upon stabilization of the properties and additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrower's successful operation of a business. Weak economic conditions may impair a borrower's business operations, lead to elevated vacancy rates or lease turnover, slow the execution of new leases or result in falling rents. These factors could result in further deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value of some of our loans. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers.\nWe make credit and reserve decisions based on current real estate values, the current conditions of borrowers, properties or projects and our expectations for the future. If real estate values or fundamentals underlying the commercial and residential real estate markets decline, we could experience higher delinquencies and charge-offs beyond that provided for in the ALLL.\nAlthough we have the Loss Sharing Agreements with the FDIC, these agreements do not cover 100% of the losses attributable to covered assets. In addition, the Loss Sharing Agreements will not mitigate any losses on our non-covered assets.\nOur portfolio of assets under operating lease is exposed to fluctuations in the demand for and valuation of the underlying assets.\nOur equipment leasing business is exposed to asset risk resulting from ownership of the equipment on operating lease. Asset risk arises from fluctuations in supply and demand for the underlying leased equipment. We are exposed to the risk that, at the end of the lease term or in the event of early termination, the value of the asset will be lower than expected, resulting in reduced future lease income over the remaining life of the asset or a lower sale value. Demand for and the valuation of the leased transportation equipment is sensitive to shifts in general and industry specific economic and market trends and shifts in trade flows from specific events such as natural or man-made disasters. A significant portion of our equipment under operating lease consists of rail cars used directly or indirectly in oil and gas drilling activities. Although we are carefully monitoring the potential impact of declines in oil and natural gas prices on our equipment on operating lease, there is no assurance that the values of this portfolio will not be adversely impacted by conditions in the energy industry.\nOur reported financial results depend on management's selection and application of accounting methods and related assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and estimates are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Management is required to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies. In some cases, management must select an accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in a restatement of prior period financial statements.\nOur internal controls may be ineffective.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our senior management team. We believe our senior management team possesses valuable knowledge about and experience in the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although certain key members of our senior management team have entered into employment agreements with us, they may not complete the terms of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. Other members of our senior management team are not subject to employment agreements. Our success also depends on the experience of other key personnel and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers, which may decrease our growth or profits.\nThe primary markets we currently serve are Florida and the New York metropolitan area. Consumer and commercial banking in these markets is highly competitive. Our markets contain not only a large number of community and regional banks, but also a significant presence of the country's largest commercial banks. We compete with other state and national financial institutions located in Florida, New York and adjoining states as well as savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions for deposits and loans. In addition, we compete with financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and several government agencies as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Increased competition among financial services companies may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to compete in our market without a retail footprint by offering competitive rates, as well as non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for certain products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards and safe and sound banking practices;\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nWe are subject to a variety of operational, legal and compliance risks, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders and operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. The occurrence of any of these events could cause us to suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to our reputation.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a diminished ability to operate our business as well as potential liability to customers and counterparties, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. Systems failures or interruptions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, many of which are provided by third parties. We rely on third-party servicers to provide key components of our business infrastructure and major systems including, but not limited to, our electronic funds transfer transaction processing, cash management and online banking services. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits, provide customer service, facilitate collections and share data across our organization. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we select and monitor the performance of third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, or failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve us. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nFailure to detect or prevent a breach in information security or to protect customer privacy could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and / or human errors, or other similar events.\nWe provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including online and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, designed to disrupt key business services such as customer-facing web sites. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Any cyber-attack or other security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation, erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to keep pace with technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for loans and deposits, and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. To some degree, our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services.\nReputational risks could affect our results.\nOur ability to originate new business and maintain existing customer relationships is highly dependent upon customer and other external perceptions of our business practices. Adverse perceptions regarding our business practices could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Adverse developments with respect to external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Adverse reputational impacts or events may also increase our litigation risk. We carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF, and the overall financial stability of the United States, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that BankUnited can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose specific accounting requirements on us. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. In addition, federal banking agencies, including the OCC and Federal Reserve Board, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, remedial actions, administrative orders and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may have a material effect on our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. There remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will ultimately be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule and rules and regulations established by the CFPB, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, require the development of new compliance infrastructure, impose upon us more stringent capital and liquidity requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. For a more detailed description of the Dodd-Frank Act, see Item 1 \"Business-Regulation and Supervision-The Dodd-Frank Act.\"\nFailure to comply with the business plan filed with the OCC could have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our business strategy.\nIn conjunction with the conversion of its charter to that of a national bank, BankUnited was required to file a business plan with the OCC, and is required to update the business plan annually. Failure to comply with the business plan could subject the Bank to regulatory actions that could impede our ability to execute our business strategy. The provisions of the business plan restrict our ability to engage in business activities outside of those contemplated in the business plan or to expand the level of our growth beyond that contemplated in the business plan without regulatory non-objection.\nOur ability to expand through acquisition or de novo branching requires regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nWe may identify opportunities to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses. We must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an institution or business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, our future prospects, and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the CRA) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell or close branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, we may continue de novo branching as a part of our internal growth strategy and possibly enter into new markets through de novo branching. De novo branching and any acquisition carries with it numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo branches may impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nFinancial institutions, such as BankUnited, face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nIn order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we dedicate significant resources to the ongoing execution of our anti-money laundering program, continuously monitor and enhance as necessary our policies and procedures and maintain a, robust automated anti-money laundering software solution. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our expansion plans.\nWe are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution's performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nThe FDIC's restoration plan and any future related increased assessments could adversely affect our earnings.\nAs a result of economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for insured depository institutions. If the current level of deposit premiums are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements in the future, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures in the future, we may be required to pay FDIC premiums higher than current levels. Any future additional assessments or increases in FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect results of operations.\nWe will become subject to more stringent capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules.\nAs noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and bank and savings and loan holding companies. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published the final Basel III Capital Rules that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The Basel III Capital Rules will apply to banking organizations, including the Company and BankUnited.\nAs a result of the enactment of the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and BankUnited will be subject to increased required capital levels. The Basel III Capital Rules become effective as applied to the Company and BankUnited on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019.", "PERMNO": 12515, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BKU"}
