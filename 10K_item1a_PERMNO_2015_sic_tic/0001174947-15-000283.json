{"cik": "95029", "company": "STURM RUGER & CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond its control. Based on current information, the Company believes that the following identifies the most significant risk factors that could adversely affect its business. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIn evaluating the Company\u2019s business, the following risk factors, as well as other information in this report, should be carefully considered.\nChanges in government policies and firearms legislation could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe sale, purchase, ownership, and use of firearms are subject to thousands of federal, state and local governmental regulations. The basic federal laws are the National Firearms Act, the Federal Firearms Act, and the Gun Control Act of 1968. These laws generally prohibit the private ownership of fully automatic weapons and place certain restrictions on the interstate sale of firearms unless certain licenses are obtained. The Company does not manufacture fully automatic weapons and holds all necessary licenses under these federal laws. Several states currently have laws in effect similar to the aforementioned legislation.\nUntil November 30, 1998, the \u201cBrady Law\u201d mandated a nationwide five-day waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun. As of November 30, 1998, the National Instant Check System, which applies to both handguns and long guns, replaced the five-day waiting period. The Company believes that the \u201cBrady Law\u201d and the National Instant Check System have not had a significant effect on the Company\u2019s sales of firearms, nor does it anticipate any significant impact on sales in the future. On September 13, 1994, the \u201cViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act\u201d banned so-called \u201cassault weapons.\u201d All the Company\u2019s then-manufactured commercially-sold long guns were exempted by name as \u201clegitimate sporting firearms.\u201d This ban expired by operation of law on September 13, 2004. The Company remains strongly opposed to laws which would restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens to lawfully acquire firearms.\nCurrently, federal and several states\u2019 legislatures are considering additional legislation relating to the regulation of firearms. These proposed bills are extremely varied, but many seek either to restrict or ban the sale and, in some cases, the ownership of various types of firearms. Other legislation seeks to require new technologies, such as microstamping and so-called \u201csmart gun\u201d technology, that are not proven, reliable or feasible. Such legislation became effective in California in 2013, which will reduce sales of certain of our products in California. If similar legislation is enacted in other states, it could effectively ban or severely limit the sale of affected firearms. There also are legislative proposals to limit magazine capacity.\nThe Company believes that the lawful private ownership of firearms is guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and that the widespread private ownership of firearms in the United States will continue. However, there can be no assurance that the regulation of firearms will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such restriction would not have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be further adversely affected if legislation with diverse requirements is enacted.\nWith literally thousands of laws being proposed at the federal, state and local levels, if even a small percentage of these laws are enacted and they are incongruent, the Company could find it difficult, expensive or even practically impossible to comply with them, impeding new product development and distribution of existing products.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation.\nThe Company faces risks arising from various asserted and unasserted litigation matters. These matters include, but are not limited to, assertions of allegedly defective product design or manufacture, alleged failure to warn, purported class actions against firearms manufacturers, generally seeking relief such as medical expense reimbursement, property damages, and punitive damages arising from accidents involving firearms or the criminal misuse of firearms, and those lawsuits filed on behalf of municipalities alleging harm to the general public. Various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results. See Note 16 to the financial statements which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for our products.\nIf demand for our products decreases significantly, we would be unable to efficiently utilize our capacity, and our profitability would suffer. Decreased demand could result from a macroeconomic downturn, or could be specific to the firearms industry. If the decrease in demand occurs abruptly, the adverse impact would be even greater.\nThe Company must comply with various laws and regulations pertaining to workplace safety and environment, environmental matters, and firearms manufacture.\nIn the normal course of its manufacturing operations, the Company is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations and related state laws, and governmental proceedings and orders. These laws and regulations pertain to workplace safety and environment, firearms serial number tracking and control, waste disposal, air emissions and water discharges into the environment. Noncompliance with any one or more of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nBusiness disruptions at one of the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Newport, New Hampshire, Prescott, Arizona and Mayodan, North Carolina facilities are critical to the Company\u2019s success. These facilities house the Company\u2019s principal production, research, development, engineering, design, and shipping operations. Any event that causes a disruption of the operation of any of these facilities for even a relatively short period of time could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to produce and ship products and to provide service to its customers.\nPrice increases for raw materials could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThird parties supply the Company with various raw materials for its firearms and castings, such as fabricated steel components, walnut, birch, beech, maple and laminated lumber for rifle stocks, wax, ceramic material, metal alloys, various synthetic products and other component parts. There is a limited supply of these materials in the marketplace at any given time, which can cause the purchase prices to vary based upon numerous market factors. The Company believes that it has adequate quantities of raw materials in inventory or on order to provide ample\ntime to locate and obtain additional items at then-current market cost without interruption of its manufacturing operations. However, if market conditions result in a significant prolonged inflation of certain prices or if adequate quantities of raw materials can not be obtained, the Company\u2019s manufacturing processes could be interrupted and the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRetention of key management is critical to the success of the Company.\nWe rely on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team. Our senior executives are not bound by employment agreements. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nThe Affordable Care Act could have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nCertain provisions of the federal healthcare legislation, in particular the \u201cunlimited lifetime benefit\u201d which eliminated the practice of capping the amount of medical benefits available to an individual, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position. The Company self-insures the cost of the medical benefits for its employees up to an annual and lifetime maximum per individual. It supplements this self-insurance with \u201cstop loss\u201d insurance for costs incurred above these maximum thresholds. In the past, the medical benefit costs for several Company employees each year have exceeded this maximum, in some cases significantly. It is the Company\u2019s expectation that if it is forced to provide an \u201cunlimited lifetime benefit\u201d its medical costs would likely increase significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.", "PERMNO": 73219, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "RGR"}
