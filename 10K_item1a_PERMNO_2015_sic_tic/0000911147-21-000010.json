{"cik": "911147", "company": "CENTURY CASINOS INC /CO/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur short and long-term success is subject to many factors beyond our control. If any of the following risks, or any risks described elsewhere in or incorporated by reference in this report, actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the pandemic is uncertain.\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in China and has since spread rapidly around the world as a pandemic, prompting aggressive actions by local, state, federal and provincial governments in the US, Canada and elsewhere to control the spread of the coronavirus. COVID-19 has significantly affected virtually all facets of the United States and global economies and continues, with new, potentially more virulent strains emerging. This outbreak and the actions taken in response to this public health epidemic, pose the risk that we or our employees, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Restrictions on travel, quarantines and other measures imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing concern regarding the virus\u2019 potential impact, have had and will likely continue to have a negative effect on economies and financial markets, including supply chain shortages and additional business disruptions. We were required to temporarily close our casinos, hotels and other facilities to comply with quarantine orders issued by governments to contain the spread of COVID-19 and may be required to temporarily close these facilities in the future. Our Canadian and Polish casinos were required to close for a second time in December 2020. Our Poland casinos reopened in February 2021, but our Canadian casinos have not yet reopened. In addition, some locations are operating with limited operating hours, limited number of gaming positions or continued closures of restaurants and other facilities or amenities, requirements to wear face masks, including the potential to require guests to wear face masks, increased frequency of disinfecting surfaces and other measures to account for varying levels of demand. See Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this report for additional information on the impact of closures on our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased demand uncertainty. Although our properties other than Canada are again operating, some customers may choose for a period of time not to visit our properties as a result of continuing concerns related to COVID-19, which could lead to lower attendance and further disruptions in our business and results of operations. Governmental officials may impose restrictions on travel or introduce additional social distancing measures. If the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States or in other jurisdictions in which we operate, or the virus recurs, we may elect on a voluntary basis to again close certain of our properties or portions thereof, or governmental officials may order additional closures, impose further restrictions on travel or introduce additional social distancing measures. The current and future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its effect on the ability and desire of people to visit our properties, is expected to continue to impact our results, operations, outlooks, plans, goals, growth cash flows and liquidity. The extent of the effects of the outbreak on our business and the casino industry at large is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, future recurrences of the outbreak, the availability and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, and the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, if at all.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could experience a longer-term impact on our costs, such as, for example, the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements in one or more regions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks. Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in ways that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider present significant risks to our operations. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nBusiness Environment and Competition Risks\nGeneral economic conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends to a large extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. The current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19 has created economic uncertainty and could cause a global recession. Adverse changes in the economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from business shutdowns and associated mass layoffs by businesses, and the adoption of social distancing and other policies to slow or control the spread of the virus, have had and are likely to continue to have a negative impact on demand for casinos, including ours, and these impacts could exist for an extensive period of time. Difficult economic conditions and recessionary periods may have an adverse impact on our business and our financial\ncondition. Negative economic conditions, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future economic landscape, have at times had a negative effect on consumers\u2019 discretionary income and consumer confidence, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decrease in discretionary spending due to decreases in consumer confidence in the economy or us, or a continued economic slowdown or deterioration in the economy, could adversely affect the frequency with which customers choose to visit our properties and the amount that our customers spend when they visit. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our customers. Both customer visits and customer spending at our casinos are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with growth and acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth and expansion through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring other gaming facilities, through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities, and through joint ventures in new markets. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or that we will experience the return on investment that we expect. Acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties, businesses and operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations, into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Our acquisitions, including the recent Acquisition of Mountaineer, Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville (the \u201cAcquired Casinos\u201d), and new developments may not generate revenue that will be sufficient to pay related expenses, or, even if such revenue is sufficient to pay related expenses, the acquisitions and new developments may not yield an adequate return or any return on our significant investments. In addition, generating returns on acquisitions, including the Acquisition, and new investments may take significantly longer than we expect and may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining the rights to develop new casino properties, and as a result, we may incur significant costs for which we will receive no return. Even if we are successful in obtaining the rights to develop such casino properties, commencing operations at new casino projects may require substantial development capital. Additional risks before commencing operations include the time and expense incurred and unforeseen difficulties from construction delays and cost overruns, in obtaining liquor licenses, building permits, materials, competent and able contractors, supplies, employees, gaming devices and related matters.\nIn addition, acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties, businesses and operations. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include:\n\uf0b7the inability to successfully integrate acquired assets in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquired operations;\n\uf0b7complexities associated with managing the combined business, including difficulties addressing possible differences in cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of the company in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\uf0b7potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquired operations;\n\uf0b7diversion of the attention of our management;\n\uf0b7the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses; and\n\uf0b7inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies;\nany of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may pursue gaming opportunities that would require us to obtain a gaming license. While our management believes that we are licensable in any jurisdiction that allows gaming operations, each licensing process is unique and requires a significant amount of funds and management time. The licensing process in any particular jurisdiction can take significant time and expense through licensing fees, background investigation costs, legal fees and other associated preparation costs. Moreover, if we proceed with a licensing approval process with industry partners, such industry partners would be subject to regulatory review as well. We seek to find industry partners that are licensable, but cannot assure that such partners will, in fact, be licensable. Certain licenses include competitive situations where, even if we and our industry partners are licensable, other factors such as the economic impact of gaming, financial and operational capabilities of competitors must be analyzed by regulatory authorities. In addition, political factors may make the licensing process more difficult. If any of our gaming license applications are denied or we are otherwise unable to complete a project, we may have to write off costs related to our investment in such application processes, which could be significant. In addition, our ability to attract and retain competent management and employees for any new location is critical to\nour success. One or more of these risks may result in any new gaming opportunity not being successful. If we are not able to successfully commence operations at these properties, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may engage in construction projects as part of our development of additional properties in the future. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Most of these factors are beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of our construction projects or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of our construction projects. This could materially adversely affect our plan of operations, financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nWe face significant competition, and if we are not able to compete successfully, our results of operations will be harmed.\nWe face intense competition from other casinos in jurisdictions in which we operate and from casinos in neighboring jurisdictions. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do. We seek to compete through promotion of our players\u2019 clubs and other marketing efforts. For example, for CRA, we emphasize the casino\u2019s showroom, complimentary heated parking, players\u2019 club program, and superior service. These marketing efforts may not be successful, which could hurt our competitive position.\nThe markets in which we operate are generally not destination resort areas and rely on a local customer base as well as tourists during peak seasons. The number of casinos in our markets may exceed demand, which could make it difficult for us to sustain profitability. We are particularly vulnerable to competition in our markets due to the large number of competitors in those markets. New or expanded operations by other entities in any of the markets in which we operate will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. For example, a potential casino in southern Illinois could increase competition at our Cape Girardeau casino, and gaming facilities in Ohio that have commenced operations in recent years present significant competition for Mountaineer.\nChanges to gaming laws in countries or states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. Any such expansion of legalized gaming could adversely impact our properties. Changes to the Colorado gaming law that allows for increased betting limits and expanded table game variety will go into effect in May 2021. It is unclear what impact these changes will have on our Colorado casinos or the Colorado market, but they could be material.\nOther potential changes in gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations include:\n\uf0b7In Missouri, a sports betting bill would allow Class B gaming licensees and daily fantasy sports licensees to conduct sports wagering including on mobile devices so long as such devices are located within the state of Missouri. This bill is in the early stages of the law-making process and subject to significant changes in proposed statutory language prior to enactment.\n\uf0b7In Missouri, a video lottery terminal bill would allow the state lottery to operate video gaming terminals, similar to slot machines, at various locations distributed across the state including bars, restaurants, veterans and fraternal organizations and convenience stores throughout the state. This bill is in the early stages of the law-making process and subject to significant changes in proposed statutory language prior to enactment.\n\uf0b7In Canada, a sports betting bill would remove the national prohibition on single-game sports betting and allow the Canadian provinces to regulate the industry. The bill needs to undergo a final review prior to enactment.\nIt is unclear what impact these changes will have on our casinos in these markets, but they could be material.\nCapital expenditures, such as those for new gaming equipment, room refurbishments and amenity upgrades may be necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness of our properties. If we are not successful in making these improvements, our facilities may be less attractive to our visitors than those of our competitors, which could have a negative impact on our business.\n\u200e\nCredit and Liquidity Risks\nOur obligations under our indebtedness and our Master Lease are significant. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and pay rent under the Master Lease and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and Master Lease, which may not be successful.\nAll of our $193.8 million face value debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 is variable rate debt. Each one percentage point change associated with the variable rate debt would result in an estimated $0.7 million change to our annual cash interest expenses. In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a triple net lease agreement (the \u201cMaster Lease\u201d) with VICI Properties Inc. (\u201cVICI PropCo\u201d) subsidiaries to lease the real estate assets of the Acquired Casinos. Our scheduled 2021 rent payments under the Master Lease are approximately $23.1 million. Our rent payments are subject to annual escalation. See Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report for more information on our long-term debt and Master Lease.\nThese financial obligations could:\n\uf0b7limit our ability to satisfy our obligations;\n\uf0b7limit our ability to obtain additional indebtedness or financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations;\n\uf0b7limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on our outstanding debt;\n\uf0b7expose us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreements;\n\uf0b7place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;\n\uf0b7subject us to restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds, and make capital expenditures and other investments;\n\uf0b7cause our failure to comply with financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us;\n\uf0b7increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry changes;\n\uf0b7limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns; and\n\uf0b7affect our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.\nWe have been required to make rent payments under the Master Lease during 2020 even during the temporary closures of the casinos covered by the Master Lease. In addition, the Master Lease requires us to make specific minimum investments in capital expenditures and, subject to certain caps, the rent escalations under the Master Lease will continue to apply regardless of the cash flows generated by the properties subject to the Master Lease and the obligations guaranteed by us. Further, if our properties subject to the Master Lease are impacted by a casualty event, the Master Lease requires us to repair or restore the affected properties even if the cost of such repair or restoration exceeds the insurance proceeds that we receive. Under such circumstances, the rent under the Master Lease is required to be paid during the period of repair or restoration even if all or a portion of the affected property is not operating. We cannot assure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay rent under the Master Lease and the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and rent obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service or rent obligations. If we are not able to meet our scheduled obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Additionally, the agreements governing our existing debt restrict sale of assets and limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition and our Master Lease limits our ability to dispose of leased properties; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to dispose of certain of our properties and use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations.\nSome of our casinos are located on leased property. If we default on one or more leases or if we are unable to secure renewals of those leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino.\nOur RECs and racetracks in Calgary and Edmonton are located on leased parcels of land, and our casinos in Poland are located within leased building spaces. If we were to default on any one or more of the leases or if we are unable to secure renewal terms for\nthese locations, the lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the land or building and any improvements on the land and buildings, including the RECs that we have built in Canada. This would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate the affected facilities.\nWe lease the land and buildings for our casinos in Missouri and West Virginia under a \u201ctriple-net\u201d Master Lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay, among other things, the following: (1) facility maintenance costs; (2) all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for incurring these costs notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the lessor as the owner of the associated facilities. In addition, we remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the Master Lease even if one or more of such leased facilities is not operating or is unprofitable or if we decide to withdraw from those locations. We could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities, including lease termination costs, impairment charges and other charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations or potential acquisitions.\nOur industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development. While we have a significant amount of cash currently on hand, we may not be able to obtain funding when we need it on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to finance our current or future expansion projects, we will have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expansion, development and renovation projects and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners, or modifying our bank credit facility. The amount of capital that we are able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control, such as the share price of our stock and its trading volume. The availability of financing may be impacted by local, regional and global economic, credit and stock market conditions, all of which have been volatile. As a result, we may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, in a timely manner or at all. If we are able to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs and, if it involves equity, may be highly dilutive to our stockholders. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to reduce, dispose of or eliminate certain operations.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities, which involve considerable expense and could harm our business, and potential changes in the regulatory environment may adversely impact us.\nAs owners and operators of gaming facilities, we are subject to extensive state, local, and international provincial regulation. State, local and provincial authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations, permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations. Various regulatory authorities may, for any reason set forth in applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of our gaming subsidiaries. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and in North America we must have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. We are scheduled for renewals for our casino licenses in Colorado, West Virginia and Missouri in 2021. A detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject, including the timing of license renewals for our properties, is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Failure to obtain license renewals would have an adverse effect on us.\nIn addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Rules and regulations regarding the service of alcoholic beverages are strict. The loss or suspension of a liquor license could significantly impair our operations.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network require us to report currency transactions at our US locations in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. US Treasury Department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000, if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Substantial\npenalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.\nFrom time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or that may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any new gaming laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Any expansion of the gaming industry that results in increased competition and any restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to record an impairment of our assets.\nWe depend on agreements with our horsemen and pari-mutuel clerks. Failure to renew or modify agreements on satisfactory terms could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn the US, the Federal Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, as amended (\u201cFIHA\u201d), and state law in West Virginia require that, in order to simulcast races, we have certain agreements with the horse owners and trainers at our racetrack. In addition, West Virginia requires applicants seeking to renew their gaming license to demonstrate they have an agreement regarding the proceeds of the gaming machines with a representative of a majority of (i) the horse owners and trainers, (ii) the pari-mutuel clerks, and (iii) the horse breeders. If we fail to present evidence of an agreement with horsemen at a track, we may not be permitted to conduct live racing and to export and import simulcasting at that track and through off-track wagering, and our video lottery license may not be renewed. In addition, our annual simulcast export agreements are subject to horsemen\u2019s approval under the FIHA. Simulcast import and export agreements require horsemen approval per West Virginia law.\nIn Canada, the Pari-Mutuel Betting Supervision Regulations require that in order to conduct pari-mutuel betting we have certain agreements with approved horsepersons addressing the sharing of revenues. If we fail to present evidence of an agreement with approved horsepersons, we may not be permitted to conduct live racing, export simulcasting and teletheatre wagering. If we are unable to conduct live racing, our license to operate a REC may not be renewed.\nIf we fail to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms, this failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in the US taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform laws or policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state, provincial and local levels in the US and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the US federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face extensive taxation from gaming and regulatory authorities. Potential changes to the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe believe that the prospect of significant revenue to a jurisdiction through taxation and fees is one of the primary reasons jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. A detailed description of the gaming taxes and fees to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, negative economic conditions could intensify the efforts of federal, state, provincial and local governments to raise revenue through increases in gaming taxes or introduction of additional gaming opportunities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and US regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC\nand US Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.\nThe development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. While our business as a whole is not dependent on either of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operation through the use of trademarks. We file applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nOperational Risks\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the occurrence of severe weather, natural or man-made disasters and other catastrophic events, including war, terrorism and other acts of violence, and disease, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reductions in the number of customers who visit our properties because of severe weather conditions. If weather conditions limit access to our casino properties or otherwise adversely impact our ability to operate our casinos at full capacity, our revenue will suffer, which will negatively impact our operating results. High winds, flooding, blizzards and sub-zero temperatures, such as those experienced in Colorado and Alberta from time to time, can limit access to our properties.\nEvents such as terrorist and war activities in the countries in which we are located and other acts of violence, such as the mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017, could have a negative impact on travel and leisure expenditures, including gaming, lodging and tourism, especially if these events occur in a region in which we operate. We cannot predict the extent to which terrorism, security alerts or war, or other acts of violence in the countries that we operate will directly or indirectly affect our business and operating results, but the impact could be material.\nAn outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic or any similar illness, could have a negative impact on travel and leisure expenditures, including gaming, lodging and tourism, especially if an outbreak were to occur in or near the areas in which we operate. Negative impacts on the economy, travel restrictions and other restrictions by local or federal governments in the areas in which we operate could result in consumers reducing travel and leisure expenditures, including visits to our casinos. Our operating costs may increase due to additional health and safety requirements, we may experience disruptions due to employee illness, and we could be forced to close our locations for a period of time. As a result of the actions taken by the US government, our management located in Europe may be unable to travel to the US. We cannot predict the extent to which future outbreaks of a contagious disease will directly or indirectly affect our business and operating results, but the impact could be material.\nDifficulties in managing our worldwide operations may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe derive our revenue principally from operations located on two continents. Our management is located in North America and Europe, and our worldwide operations pose risks to our business, especially for a smaller company such as ours. Risks associated with international operations include:\n\uf0b7different time zones;\n\uf0b7culture, management and language differences;\n\uf0b7fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\uf0b7changes in laws and policies that govern our foreign operations;\n\uf0b7possible failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the US FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\uf0b7difficulty in establishing staffing and managing non-United States operations;\n\uf0b7different labor regulations;\n\uf0b7changes in environmental, health and safety laws;\n\uf0b7potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\uf0b7political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\uf0b7economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and\n\uf0b7uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.\nThese factors make it more challenging to manage and administer a globally-dispersed business and, as a result, we must devote greater resources to operating under several regulatory and legislative regimes (See \u201cGovernmental Regulation and Licensing\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d of this report). This business model also increases our costs.\nThe evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us.\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from slot machines operated at our gaming facilities. In order to remain competitive, we seek to offer the most popular and up-to-date slot machine games to our customers. In recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently required new slot machines to be leased through participation arrangements instead of selling the machines. Participation arrangements typically require payments based on a percentage of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation arrangement is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than costs associated with continuing to operate our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment and costs, it may negatively impact our operating results.\nIn addition, a substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the US in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector in recent years. A decrease in the competition in the slot machine manufacturing industry could lead to increased costs related to the acquisition or rental of slot machines and other gaming equipment.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future.\nWe may suffer damage to our property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other acts of violence) that could severely disrupt our business or subject us to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although we maintain insurance customary in our industry, including property, casualty, terrorism, cybersecurity and business interruption insurance, that insurance is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitations on the coverage period for business interruption. Due to these variables, we may not be able to fully insure such losses, or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from severe weather conditions. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses if any damages occur, directly or indirectly, that could have a significant adverse impact on our operations.\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage or self-insure. Among other factors, regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nWe are dependent upon technology services and electrical power to operate our business, and if we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations, resulting in a decrease in revenue.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security system and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate. A loss of electrical power or a failure of the technology services needed to run the computers would make us unable to run all or parts of our gaming operations. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Although we have designed our systems around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Additionally, substantial increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur reputation and business may be harmed by cybersecurity breaches, and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers', our business partners' or our own information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe make use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for marketing and promotional purposes, is a critical element of our operations. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws as well as the applicable laws of the countries in which we operate. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, that changed companies\u2019 operational and compliance requirements and included significant penalties for non-compliance. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests.\nOur information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers, or our employee or business information may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or by actions or inactions by our employees. As a result, information of our customers, third party service providers or business partners or our employee or business information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their or our consent. Non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in a loss of customers and subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. The loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nHuman Capital Risks\nThe loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger, our founders and Co-Chief Executive Officers, and other members of our senior management team. The employment agreements with Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger provide that, under some circumstances, the departure of one executive could allow the other to leave for cause. Our ability to retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed by work stoppages and other labor issues.\nThere are 229 employees at our CPL casinos in Poland who belong to trade unions. The trade unions do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with CPL but changes in pay for union employees at CPL require approval from the trade unions. In the United States, there are 48 employees at our West Virginia casino who belong to unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at our casino properties with unions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our other employees in the US and Canada and in our Corporate and Other segment are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, we have experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. If a union seeks to organize any of our employees, we could experience disruption in our business and incur significant costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. If a union were successful in organizing any of our employees, we could experience significant increases in our labor costs which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, changes to labor laws or prevailing market conditions could lead to increased labor costs that could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nCommon Stock and Stockholder Risks\nCertain anti-takeover measures we have adopted may limit our ability to consummate transactions that some of our security holders might otherwise support.\nWe have a fair price business combination provision in our certificate of incorporation, which requires approval of certain business combinations and other transactions by holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of voting stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. These provisions generally have the effect of requiring that any party seeking to acquire us negotiate with our board of directors in order to structure a business combination with us. This may have the effect of depressing the price of our common stock due to the possibility that certain transactions that our stockholders might favor could be precluded by these provisions.\nStockholders may be required to dispose of their shares of our common stock if they are found unsuitable by gaming authorities.\nGaming authorities in the US and Canada generally can require that any beneficial owner of our common stock and other securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate an owner's suitability, and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities. Our certificate of incorporation also provides us with the right to repurchase shares of our common stock from certain beneficial owners declared by gaming regulators to be unsuitable holders of our equity securities, and the price we pay to any such beneficial owner may be below the price such beneficial owner would otherwise accept for his or her shares of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits and gaming regulatory proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have open tax audits currently in litigation with the Polish Internal Revenue Service (\u201cPolish IRS\u201d), as described further in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. Additional tax obligations as a result of the tax audits by the Polish IRS could adversely affect our financial position.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency controls in foreign countries could adversely affect our business.\nThe revenue generated and expenses incurred at our casinos in Canada and Poland are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and Polish zloty, respectively. Decreases in the value of these currencies in relation to the value of the US dollar have decreased the operating profit from our foreign operations when translated into US dollars, which has adversely affected our consolidated results of operations, and such decreases may occur in the future. In addition, we may expand our operations into other countries and, accordingly, we could face similar exchange rate risk with respect to the costs of doing business in such countries as a result of any increases in the value of the US dollar in relation to the currencies of such countries. We do not currently hedge our exposure to fluctuations of these foreign currencies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully hedge any future foreign currency exposure.\nWe may be required in the future to record impairment losses related to assets we currently carry on our balance sheet.\nWe have $681 million of tangible and intangible assets, including $11 million of goodwill, $32 million in casino licenses, $4 million in trademarks and $519 million in property and equipment as of December 31, 2020. Accounting rules require that we make certain estimates and assumptions related to our determinations as to the future recoverability of these assets. If we were to determine that the values of these assets carried on our balance sheet are impaired due to adverse changes in our business or otherwise, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the value of these assets, which would adversely affect our results during the period in which we recorded the impairment charge. In 2020, we impaired $35.1 million related to goodwill and other intangible assets, including our MCE cost investment, due to the impact from COVID-19. See Notes 4 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report for more information on our goodwill and other intangible assets.", "PERMNO": 79791, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "CNTY"}
