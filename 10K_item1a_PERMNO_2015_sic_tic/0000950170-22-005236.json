RISK FACTORS\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. All statements, other than statements of historical information, should be deemed to be forward-looking statements. The words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cforesee,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould\u201d or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to, the risks set forth below. The risks described below are those that we have identified as material and is not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. If any events occur that give rise to the following risks, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. These risk factors, some of which are beyond our control or not readily predictable, should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $400.8 million of total debt (not including capital lease obligations), consisting of $400.0 million of the 2029 Notes and $0.8 million of financed insurance and vehicles. Our indebtedness requires significant interest and principal payments. Subject to certain limitations and the satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the 2029 Indenture, we may also be permitted to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could increase.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022continuing to require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and any future business opportunities;\n\u2022limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022making us more susceptible to changes in credit ratings, which could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the 2029 Indenture prevents us from incurring additional debt or liens for working capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes (subject to very limited exceptions). Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to repay our indebtedness and comply with the restrictive covenants will be dependent on, among other things, the successful execution of our strategic plans. If we require additional capacity under the restrictive covenants to successfully execute our strategic plans, we will need to seek the required consent from a majority of the holders of the 2029 Notes. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining such consent, and any failure to do so will have a material adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results.\nOur ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take certain actions, including reducing spending on day-to-day operations, reducing future financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. The trustee or the holders of the 2029 Notes could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our debt.\nIn addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in our industry could be impaired, and our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged, as these competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general.\nDespite our current indebtedness level, we and any of our existing or future subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe and any of our existing and future subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of the 2029 Indenture contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions will be subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions We have the ability under the 2029 Indenture to incur up to $40 million of additional senior secured debt and we anticipate entering into a revolving credit facility in that amount in the second quarter of 2022. If new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could be exacerbated.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness or repay such indebtedness when due, including the 2029 Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the 2029 Notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control, including the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, our indebtedness, including the 2029 Notes, or any portion of any of the foregoing, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the 2029 Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of the 2029 Indenture restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The 2029 Indenture restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe 2029 Indenture imposes significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions.\nThe 2029 Indenture contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022transfer or sell certain assets, including capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022create or incur liens;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022agree to dividend or other payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022change the business we conduct;\n\u2022withdraw any monies or other assets from, or make any investments of, our trust funds; and\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy them.\nOTHER FINANCIAL RISKS\nPre-need sales typically generate low or negative cash flow in the periods immediately following sales, which could adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.\nWhen we sell cemetery merchandise and services on a pre-need basis, upon cash collection, we pay commissions on the sale to our salespeople and are required by state law to deposit a portion of the sales proceeds into a merchandise trust. In addition, most of our customers finance their pre-need purchases under installment contracts payable over a number of years. Depending on the\ntrusting requirements of the states in which we operate, the applicable sales commission rates and the amount of the down payment, our cash flow from sales to customers through installment contracts is typically negative until we have collected the related receivable or until we purchase the products or perform the services and are permitted to withdraw funds we have deposited in the merchandise trust. To the extent we increase pre-need sales, state trusting requirements are increased or we delay the performance of the services or delivery of merchandise we sell on a pre-need basis, our cash flow from pre-need sales may be further reduced, and our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective which could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements and may adversely affect our liquidity, the market for our common shares and our business.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 13a-15(f), respectively, under the Exchange Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide timely, reliable and accurate financial reports, identify and proactively correct any deficiencies, material weaknesses or fraud and meet our reporting obligations. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our independent registered public accounting firm also expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs discussed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report, our remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and ineffective disclosure controls and procedures are ongoing and had been delayed primarily due to management turnover and the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. We currently expect the remediation of the identified material weaknesses to be completed during 2022. If our planned remediation actions are not successfully implemented or we encounter other difficulties, we might incur significant unexpected expenses in order to perform the Section 404 evaluation and our ability to file timely with the SEC may be adversely impacted. In addition, if our remedial measures are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls occur in the future, we could be required to further restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weaknesses or deficiencies, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nThe financial condition of third-party insurance companies that fund our pre-need funeral contracts and the amount of benefits those policies ultimately pay may impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWhere permitted, customers may arrange their pre-need funeral contract by purchasing a life insurance or annuity policy from third-party insurance companies. The customer/policy holder assigns the policy benefits to our funeral home to pay for the pre-need funeral contract at the time of need. For the sales of pre-need funeral contracts funded through life insurance policies, we receive commissions from third-party insurance companies. Additionally, there is a death benefit associated with the contract that may vary over the contract life. There is no guarantee that the value of the death benefit will increase or cover future increases in the cost of providing a funeral service. If the financial condition of the third-party insurance companies were to deteriorate materially because of market conditions or otherwise, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to collect all or part of the proceeds of the life insurance or annuity policy, including any increase in the death benefit. Failure to collect such proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur liquidity may be impacted by our ability to negotiate bonding arrangements with third-party insurance companies.\nWhere permitted, we have entered into and may continue to enter into bonding arrangements with insurance companies, whereby pre-need performance obligations otherwise required to be trusted may be insured through a process called bonding. In the event that we are unable to deliver on bonded pre-need contract sales at the time of need, the insurance company will provide cash sufficient to deliver goods for the respective pre-need sale item. On an ongoing basis, we must negotiate acceptable terms of these various bonding arrangements, and the insurance companies have required us to provide cash collateral from time to time under certain circumstances. To the extent we are unable to negotiate acceptable terms for such arrangements and thus are no longer able to maintain existing bonds, we would need to deposit the corresponding amounts in the merchandise trusts. We may be required to provide additional cash collateral from time to time under certain circumstances. Any of these actions would have an adverse impact on our liquidity.\nOur ability to use our Net Operating Losses and other tax assets is uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $477.0 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and substantially similar tax assets at the federal and state levels. Along with other previous transfers of our interests, we believe that certain recapitalization transactions completed in 2019 (the \u201cRecapitalization Transactions\u201d) caused a \u201cchange of control\u201d for income tax purposes, which may significantly limit our ability to use NOLs and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income, possibly reducing the amount of cash available to us to satisfy our obligations. The \u201cchange of control\u201d rules limit the annual net operating loss deduction in a given year to an amount based on the value of the Company on the change date multiplied by the federal tax exempt bond rate. This makes it more likely for the Company to pay some amount of income tax in the years it has positive taxable income. This limitation also makes it more likely for NOL carryovers to expire unutilized.\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to the Partnership\u2019s income tax returns for 2018 or 2019 tax years, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for our 2018 and 2019 tax years, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to the Partnership\u2019s income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us. To the extent possible under the new rules, we may elect to either pay the taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if we are eligible, issue a revised Schedule K-1 to each holder of the Partnership\u2019s common units during the applicable year with respect to an unaudited and adjusted return. Although we may elect to have such unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in the Partnership during the tax year under audit, there can be no assurance the election will be practical, permissible or effective in all circumstances. As a result, StoneMor Inc. may be required to pay the necessary taxes, which would mean that our current stockholders may indirectly bear some or all of the impact of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if they did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and/or interest, our financial condition could be adversely affected. These rules were not applicable for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.\nBecause fixed costs are inherent in our business, a decrease in our revenues can have a disproportionate effect on our cash flow and profits.\nOur business requires us to incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period. For example, we must pay salaries, utilities, property taxes and maintenance costs on our cemetery properties and funeral homes regardless of the number of interments or funeral services we perform. If we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales, declines in sales can cause our margins, profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in our revenues.\nEconomic, financial and stock market fluctuations could affect future potential earnings and cash flows and could result in future intangible asset and long-lived asset impairments.\nIn addition to an annual review, we assess the impairment of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value and therefore not fully recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flow, undiscounted and without interest, expected to be generated by the assets. Factors that could trigger an interim impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant decline in the market value of our stock or debt values, significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Based on the results of our impairment tests of our long-lived assets throughout 2021, we concluded that none of our long-lived assets were impaired.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nCemetery burial practice claims could have a material adverse impact on our financial results, and unfavorable publicity resulting from claims, or otherwise, could affect our reputation and business.\nOur cemetery practices have evolved and improved over time. Most of our cemeteries have been operating for decades and some have in the past used practices and procedures that are outdated in comparison to today\u2019s standards. When cemetery disputes occur, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation and liability for improper burial practices, including:\n\u2022burial practices of a different era that are judged today in hindsight as being outdated; and\n\u2022alleged violations of our practices and procedures by one or more of our associates.\nIn addition, since we acquired most of our cemeteries from third parties, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation and liability based upon actions or events that occurred before we acquired or managed the cemeteries. Claims or litigation based upon our cemetery burial practices could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince our operations relate to life events that are emotionally stressful for our client families, our business is dependent on customer trust and confidence. Unfavorable publicity about our business generally or in relation to any specific location could affect our reputation and customers\u2019 trust and confidence in our products and services, thereby having an adverse impact upon our sales and financial results.\nOur business may be affected by rising inflation and other issues that affect consumer spending.\nOur results of operations are affected by the level of consumer spending and, therefore, by changes in the economic factors that impact consumer spending. Although the rate of inflation has been low in recent years, we are currently experiencing a significant rise in inflation. This and other economic conditions or events, such as a contraction in the financial markets, higher interest rates, high unemployment levels, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, higher fuel, energy and other commodity costs and product cost increases, could reduce or shift consumer spending generally, which could cause our customers to spend less on the merchandise and services they purchase from us. Reduced consumer spending may also result in reduced demand for our pre-need products and services. A reduction or shift in consumer spending could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to generate pre-need sales depends on a number of factors, including sales incentives and local and general economic conditions.\nSignificant declines in pre-need sales would reduce our backlog and revenue and could reduce our future market share. On the other hand, a significant increase in pre-need sales could have a negative impact on cash flow as a result of commissions and other costs incurred initially without corresponding revenue.\nWe are continuing to refine the mix of service and product offerings in both our funeral and cemetery segments, including changes in our sales commission and incentive structure. These changes could cause us to experience declines in pre-need sales in the short-run. In addition, economic conditions at the local or national level could cause declines in pre-need sales either as a result of less discretionary income or lower consumer confidence. Declines in pre-need cemetery property sales reduce current revenue, and declines in other pre-need sales would reduce our backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified sales personnel and management could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to attract and retain a qualified sales force and other personnel is an important factor in achieving future success. Buying cemetery and funeral home products and services, especially at-need products and services, is very emotional for most customers, so our sales force must be particularly sensitive to our customers\u2019 needs. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain a skilled sales force. If we are unable to maintain a qualified and productive sales force, our revenues may decline and our cash available for distribution may decrease.\nOur success also depends upon the services and capabilities of our management team. Management establishes the \u201ctone at the top\u201d by which an environment of ethical values, operating style and management philosophy is fostered. The inability of our senior management team to maintain a proper \u201ctone at the top\u201d or the loss of services of one or more members of senior management, as well as the inability to attract qualified managers or other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available. We do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nOur ability to manage and maintain our internal reports effectively and integrate new business acquisitions depends significantly on our operational technology platform and other information systems. Some of our information technology systems may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems implementation work. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems and corruption of data. The failure of our systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems or a breach in security or other unauthorized access of these systems may also result in reduced efficiency of our operations and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach and to comply with applicable regulations, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our customers, their loved ones, our employees and our vendors could damage our reputation, cause us to incur substantial additional costs and make us subject to litigation, all of which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or cash flow.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive certain personal information, in both physical and electronic formats, about our customers, their loved ones, our employees and our vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting electronic payments. We maintain security measures and data backup systems to protect, store and prevent unauthorized access to such information. However, it is possible that computer hackers and others (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might defeat our security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, their loved ones, our employees and our vendors that we hold. In addition, our employees, contractors or third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures to misappropriate such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach, corruption or data loss involving such information. A breach of our security measures or failure in our backup systems could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and their loved ones, our employees and our vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. It could also result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nFrom time to time, we are party to various claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, claims and proceedings regarding employment, cemetery or burial practices and other litigation. As set forth more fully in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies of this Annual Report, we are currently subject to state law claims that certain of our officers and directors breached their fiduciary duty to the Company. We could also become subject to additional claims and legal proceedings relating to the factual allegations made in these actions. We are also subject to class or collective actions under the wage and hours provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws, including, but not limited to, national and state class or collective actions, or putative class or collective actions.\nAdverse outcomes in some or all of our pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us, as litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties. Any such adverse outcomes, in pending cases or other lawsuits that may arise in the future, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. While we hold insurance policies that may reduce cash outflows with respect to adverse outcomes of certain litigation matters, these insurance policies exclude certain claims, such as claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\nIn addition, litigation claims and legal proceedings could demand substantial amounts of our management\u2019s time, resulting in the diversion of our management resources from effectively managing our business operations, and costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings could be material. Any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation. All these factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions caused by global health concerns, including the COVID-19 Pandemic, and other crises could adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\nGlobal health concerns, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic, could result in social, economic and labor instability that adversely affect our employee and customer relationships, pre-need sales activity, the value of our trust investments and associated funding obligations, and in so doing adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, governmental actions restricting public gatherings and interaction may result in our customers deferring making purchase decisions regarding pre-need arrangements or delaying holding funeral services and may result in our inability to operate our cemeteries and funeral homes, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although our cemeteries and funeral homes have largely remained open and available to serve our families in all the locations in which we operate to the extent permitted by local authorities, throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic, this may not continue. We have experienced limited location closures due to COVID-19 cases, required quarantines and cleanings. In addition, our pre-need customers with installment contracts could default on their installment contracts due to lost work or other financial stresses arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Having to adjust our policies and practices to respond to global health concerns could also result in increased operating expenses. We continue to monitor this ongoing public health crisis and its impact on our employees, customers and vendors and the overall economic environment within the U.S. and worldwide, but we cannot presently predict the full scope and severity of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to legal restrictions on our marketing practices that could reduce the volume of our sales, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nThe enactment or amendment of legislation or regulations relating to marketing activities may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. For example, the federal \u201cdo not call\u201d legislation has adversely affected our ability to market our products and services using telephone solicitation, by limiting whom we may call and increasing our costs of compliance. As a result, we rely heavily on direct mail marketing and telephone follow-up with existing contacts. Additional laws or regulations limiting our ability to market through direct mail, over the telephone, through Internet and e-mail advertising or door-to-door may make it difficult to identify potential customers, which could increase our costs of marketing. Both increases in marketing costs and restrictions on our ability to market effectively could reduce our revenues and could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to generate cash to pay our debts.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nOur ability to execute our strategic plans depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur strategic plans are focused on efforts to revitalize the business, grow our revenue and manage our operating and non-recurring operating expenses. Many of the factors that impact our ability to execute our strategic plans, such as the number of deaths and general economic conditions, are beyond our control. Changes in operating conditions, such as supply disruptions and labor disputes, could negatively impact our operations. If we are unable to leverage scale to drive cost savings, productivity improvements, pre-need production or anticipated earnings growth, or if we are unable to deploy capital to maximize stockholder value, our financial performance could be affected. If we are unable to identify acquisitions and/or divestitures as planned or to realize expected synergies and strategic benefits, our financial performance could also be affected. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to execute any or all of our strategic plans. Failure to execute any or all of our strategic plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Refer to \u201cGeneral Trends and Outlook\u201d of Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of our business strategies.\nFailure to effectively identify and manage acquisitions and divestitures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that could strategically fit our business objectives. Refer to \u201cRecent Events\u201d of Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of our recently completed acquisitions. However, we may not be successful in identifying and acquiring additional cemeteries or funeral homes on terms favorable to us or at all and may face competition from other death care companies in making acquisitions. In addition, if we complete acquisitions, we may encounter various associated risks, including:\n\u2022the failure to achieve our strategic objectives or performance expectations, for example due to the inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations;\n\u2022over-valuation of the companies or assets that we acquire;\n\u2022disputes that may occur with the sellers;\n\u2022failure to effectively monitor compliance with corporate policies and/or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business;\n\u2022unanticipated risks or liabilities associated with the acquired company\u2019s operations; and\n\u2022insufficient indemnification from the sellers for liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. Moreover, if we acquire cemeteries that do not have an existing pre-need sales program or a significant amount of pre-need products and services that have been sold but not yet purchased or performed, the operation of the cemetery and implementation of a pre-need sales program after acquisition may require significant amounts of working capital. Additionally, we could incur impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges as a result of acquisitions we make.\nIn addition, during 2021 and 2020, we completed several divestitures as part of an asset sale program designed to divest assets at attractive multiples, reduce debt levels and improve cash flow and liquidity. However, we may not be successful in identifying additional divestiture opportunities on terms acceptable to us and the gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Loss from continuing operations before income taxes included a Loss on sale of business and other impairments of $2.3 million.\nIf our execution and implementation of acquisitions and divestitures is unsuccessful, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected. We may also incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures or acquisitions that would reduce our earnings.\nRISKS RELATED TO TRUST FUNDS\nOur merchandise and perpetual care trust funds own investments in equity securities, fixed income securities, mutual funds and master limited partnerships, which are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nPursuant to state law, a portion of the proceeds from pre-need sales of merchandise and services is put into merchandise trusts until such time that we meet the requirements for releasing trust principal, which is generally delivery of merchandise or performance of services. In addition, the 2029 Indenture also provides certain limitations on how the assets in the merchandise trusts may be invested. Generally, a majority of the investment earnings generated by the assets in the merchandise trusts, including realized gains and losses, are deferred until the associated merchandise is delivered or the services are performed.\nAlso, pursuant to state law, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of cemetery property is required to be paid into perpetual care trusts. The perpetual care trust principal does not belong to us and must remain in this trust in perpetuity while interest and dividends may be released and used to defray cemetery maintenance costs.\nThese trust assets are managed by a trustee, which is advised by Cornerstone, our registered investment adviser subsidiary, all under the oversight of the Trust and Compliance Committee of our Board. Cornerstone has engaged three sub-advisers, including Axar, to assist Cornerstone in providing investment recommendations with respect to certain trust assets, on a non-discretionary basis. There is no guarantee that the trustee will achieve its objectives and deliver adequate returns, and the trustee\u2019s investment choices may result in losses. In addition, our returns on these investments are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond our control. If the investments in our trust funds experience significant declines, there could be insufficient funds in the\ntrusts to cover the costs of delivering services and merchandise. Pursuant to state law, we may be required to cover any such shortfall in merchandise trusts with cash flows from operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from investment returns that we realize from merchandise and perpetual care trusts. Unstable economic conditions have, at times, caused us to experience declines in the fair value of the assets held in these trusts. Moreover, future cash flows could be negatively impacted if we are forced to liquidate any such investments that are in an impaired position.\nIf the fair market value of these trusts, plus any other amount due to us upon delivery of the associated contracts, were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services, we would be required to record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected losses on the delivery of the associated contracts.\nFor more information related to our trust investments, see Note 6 Merchandise Trusts and Note 7 Perpetual Care Trusts to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.\nWe may be required to replenish our funeral and cemetery trust funds in order to meet minimum funding requirements, which would have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flow.\nIn certain states, we have withdrawn allowable distributable earnings from our merchandise trusts, including gains prior to the maturity or cancellation of the related contract. Additionally, some states have laws that either require replenishment of investment losses under certain circumstances or impose various restrictions on withdrawals of future earnings when trust fund values drop below certain prescribed amounts. In the event of realized losses or market declines, we may be required to deposit portions or all of these amounts into the respective trusts in some future period. As of December 31, 2021, we had unrealized losses of approximately $0.5 million in the various trusts within these states, of which $0.4 million were in merchandise trust accounts and $0.1 million were in perpetual care trust accounts. To date, we have not been required to make such deposits; however one state has restricted us from withdrawing otherwise distributable earnings from the perpetual care trust until the accounts recover from losses.\nAny reductions in the earnings of the investments held in merchandise and perpetual care trusts could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.\nWe invest our trust assets primarily for generation of realized income. We rely on the earnings, interest and dividends paid by the assets in our trusts to provide both revenue and cash flow. Interest income from fixed-income securities is particularly susceptible to changes in interest rates and declines in credit worthiness while dividends from equity securities are susceptible to the issuer\u2019s ability to make such payments. Declines in earnings from perpetual care trust funds would cause a decline in current revenue, while declines in earnings from other trust funds could cause a decline in future cash flows and revenue.\nCOMPETITIVE AND MARKET RISKS IN THE DEATHCARE INDUSTRY\nThe cemetery and funeral home industry continues to be competitive, and if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences, our market share, revenues and profitability could decrease.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on our management\u2019s forward vision, timely responses to changes in the business environment and the ability of our cemeteries and funeral homes to maintain a good reputation and high professional standards as well as offer products and services at competitive prices. If we are unable to compete successfully, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe experience price competition from independent funeral service location and cemetery operators, monument dealers, casket retailers, low-cost funeral providers and other nontraditional providers of merchandise and services. New market entrants tend to attempt to build market share by offering lower cost alternatives. In the past, this price competition has resulted in our losing market share in some markets. In other markets, we have had to reduce prices or offer discounts, thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share. Independent competitors tend to be aggressive in distinguishing themselves by their independent ownership, and they promote their independence through television, radio and print advertising, direct mailings and personal contact. Increasing pressures from new market entrants and continued advertising and marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue. In addition, competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered. These changes may attract customers, causing us to lose market share and revenue as well as to incur costs in response to this competition. Increased use of the internet by customers to research and/or purchase products and services could also have an adverse impact upon our sales and financial results.\nFuture market share, revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences ahead of and/or better than our competitors. In addition, any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective.\nIf the trend toward cremation in the U.S. continues, our revenues may decline, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe and other deathcare companies that focus on traditional methods of interment face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the U.S. Industry statistics compiled by the Cremation Association of North America indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased. In 2020, the U.S. cremation rate was 56.1%, with an annual growth rate per year over 2015 to 2020 of 1.5%. The cremation rate is projected to increase to 65.2% by 2025 and 72.8% by 2030. Because the products and services associated with cremations, such as niches and urns, produce lower revenues than the products and services associated with traditional interments, a continuing trend toward cremation may reduce our revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, sales related to cremations represented approximately 5.8% and 7.1%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.\nDeclines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues.\nDeclines in the number of deaths could cause at-need sales of cemetery and funeral home merchandise and services to decline and could cause a decline in the number of pre-need sales, both of which could decrease revenues. Changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter, and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable. Generally, the number of deaths may fluctuate depending on weather conditions and illness.\nRisks associated with our supply chain could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are dependent on our supply chain to supply merchandise to our cemetery and funeral home locations. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly, if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments, or if delivery networks have difficulty providing capacity to meet demands for their services, we could experience merchandise delivery delays or increased delivery costs, which could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence and adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain, due to inflation or other matters, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulation and compliance could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including extensive regulations concerning trusts/escrows, pre-need sales, cemetery ownership, funeral home ownership, marketing practices, crematories, environmental matters and various other aspects of our business. For example, the funeral industry is regulated at the federal level by the FTC, which requires funeral service locations to take actions designed to protect consumers. Our facilities are also subject to stringent health, safety, and environmental regulations. Our pay practices, including wage and hour overtime pay, are also subject to federal and state regulations. Violations of applicable laws could result in fines or sanctions against us. We may experience significant increases in costs as a result of business regulations and laws, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. Although we seek to control increases in these costs, continued upward pressure on costs could reduce the profitability of our business.\nState laws impose licensing requirements and regulate pre-need sales. As such, we are subject to state trust fund and pre-need sales practice audits, which could result in audit adjustments as a result of non-compliance. In addition, we assume the liability for any audit adjustments for our acquired businesses for periods under audit prior to our ownership of these acquired businesses. These audit adjustments could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, from time to time, governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations or reinterpret existing regulations, which could increase costs and decrease cash flows. For example, foreign, federal, state, local, and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the deathcare industry. These include regulations that require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for pre-need sales of products and services, limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding, require the escheatment of trust funds, increase trust requirements, require the deposit of funds or collateral to offset unrealized losses of trusts, and/or prohibit the common ownership of funeral service locations and cemeteries in the same market. If adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate, these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCompliance with laws, regulations, industry standards, and customs concerning burial procedures and the handling and care of human remains is critical to the continued success of our business. We continually monitor and review our operations in an effort to ensure that we take the right actions necessary to remaining in compliance with these laws, regulations and standards. However, litigation and regulatory proceedings regarding these issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nFor additional information regarding the regulation of the funeral and cemetery industry, see Part I, Item 1. Business, Regulation of this Annual Report.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nAxar holds a majority of the voting power of our common stock.\nAxar beneficially owns approximately 74.9% of our outstanding common stock and as a result, has the ability, subject to certain restrictions in a voting agreement, to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors. In addition, subject to certain restrictions in that voting agreement, it will be able to determine the outcome of all other matters requiring stockholder approval, including certain mergers and other material transactions, and will be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our Company. So long as Axar continues to own a significant amount of our outstanding shares, even if such amount is less than 50%, it will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that the transaction is in their own best interests. Axar\u2019s ownership interest also makes us a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) listing standards. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, consistent with the listing standards applicable to companies that are not controlled companies, require that a majority of our directors and all of the members of our Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee be independent within the meaning of those standards. However, we can amend our Corporate Governance Guidelines in our Board\u2019s discretion, and as a controlled company, we are not subject to the requirement that a majority of our directors and all of the members of our Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee be independent.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nThe 2029 Indenture governing our 2029 Notes prohibits us from paying any dividends with limited exceptions.\nGENERAL RISKS\nA number of years may elapse before particular tax matters, for which we have established accruals, are audited and finally resolved.\nWe are subject to federal income tax laws and state tax laws. The number of tax years open to audit varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The federal statutes of limitations have expired for all tax years prior to 2016, and we are not currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). Various state jurisdictions are conducting sales tax audits from years 2015 to 2019 and escheat audits from year 2005 to present day. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our accruals reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. However, unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may reduce a deferred tax asset or require the use of cash, which may have a material adverse impact to our financial statements. Favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense reported in the financial statements in the future. For further details, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12 Income Taxes of this Annual Report.\nChanges in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nWe make judgments regarding the utilization of existing income tax credits and the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. Tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results, or adverse tax rulings on positions taken could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow.", "PERMNO": 90366, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "STON"}
