{"cik": "1389545", "company": "NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, the most important of which are discussed below. You should consider carefully the following risks in addition to the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC before deciding to buy, sell or hold our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity\nWe have a history of losses and we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability.\nWe have historically incurred net losses, and we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability. In addition, at this time, we expect to incur substantial marketing and sales expenses as we continue efforts to increase sales of our Avenova and CelleRx products, and our results of operations may fluctuate significantly.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. Even with current Avenova sales, if we cannot successfully market and sell our Avenova or CelleRx products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability. Our failure to achieve and subsequently maintain profitability could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, which may result in losses to our stockholders.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry have generally experienced wide fluctuations, which are often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of new products by us or our competitors\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of partnering arrangements by us or our competitors\u037e\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our earnings estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts' earnings estimates;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our industry\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by our largest stockholder, Pioneer Pharma (Hong Kong) Company Ltd. (\u201cPioneer Hong Kong\u201d), within a short period of time; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral, economic and market conditions, including volatility in the financial markets, a decrease in consumer confidence and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nWe have not paid dividends or repurchased stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends or repurchase stock in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on, or repurchased shares of, our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on, or the repurchase of shares of, our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends or repurchase stock, you will experience a return on your investment in our shares only if our stock price appreciates. We cannot assure you that you will receive a return on your investment when you sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment.\nChina Pioneer Pharma Holdings Limited (\u201cChina Pioneer\u201d) and/or China Kington Asset Management (\u201cChina Kington\u201d) have influence over our corporate matters.\nPioneer Hong Kong, a subsidiary of China Pioneer, beneficially owns approximately 12.4% of our outstanding common stock. Our director Mr. Xinzhou \u201cPaul\u201d Li is the chairman of China Pioneer and our director Mr. Mijia \u201cBob\u201d Wu is a Non-Executive Director of China Pioneer as well as the Managing Director of China Kington (an affiliated party of the Company due to various historical transactions as disclosed in reports filed with the SEC).\nAs a result, subject to the fiduciary duties Messrs. Li and Wu owe to the Company in their role as directors, China Pioneer and China Kington have input on all matters before our Board of Directors and may be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring board and stockholder approval.\nIf our stockholders' equity does not meet the minimum standards of the NYSE American, we may be subject to delisting procedures.\nHistorically, the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity as been below the minimum requirements of Section 1003(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d) though the Company has met all such minimum requirements since October 13, 2020. In accordance with Section 1009(h) of the Company Guide, if the Company is again determined to be below any of the continued listing standards prior to October 13, 2021, the NYSE American will examine the relationship between the two incidents of non-compliance and re-evaluate the Company\u2019s method of financial recovery from the first incident. The NYSE American will take the appropriate action which, depending on the circumstances, may include initiating its compliance procedures or initiating delisting proceedings. If our common stock is delisted, this could, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds; result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer financing opportunities for us; and/or result in potential breaches of representations or covenants of our warrants, subscription agreements or other agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management's time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business may be adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, COVID-19 spread to other countries, including the United States, and efforts to contain the spread of this coronavirus intensified. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health measures were implemented across much of the United States, including the San Francisco Bay area counties where the Company\u2019s headquarters is located. Due to \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health guidance measures, the Company implemented a work-from-home policy for all staff members. As the shelter-in-place restrictions are lifted, the Company has opened its business in phases by staggering the timeline for returning employees to work. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation, particularly in relation to our field sales representatives. In particular, in the second quarter of 2020, we experienced a slowdown in Avenova sales in our prescription and in-office direct channels, as patient visits to eyecare specialists decreased substantially due to the nationwide shelter-in-place mandates. Overall, the impact of COVID-19 has been minimal on the sales of Avenova as an increase in online sales has made up for the decrease in prescription revenue.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which the outbreak may continue to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration of the outbreak, evolution of COVID-19 into novel strands of the disease, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as social distancing, quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and elsewhere, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and elsewhere to contain and treat the disease through vaccination. Future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of our products, particularly Avenova.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products. While we believe we are creating an efficient commercial organization, we may not be able to judge correctly the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution necessary to be successful. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of Avenova and/or CelleRx, which could cause our commercialization efforts to be unprofitable or less profitable than expected.\nAcceptance and use of Avenova and/or CelleRx by physicians and customers may depend on a number of factors including: (i) perceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products\u037e (ii) published studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products; (iii) availability of reimbursement for our products from government or commercial payers as relates to Avenova\u037e and (iv) effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any. The failure of any of our products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nAvenova faces substantial competition in the eye care markets in which we operate.\nWe face intense competition in the eye care market, which is focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product effectiveness and quality, patient convenience and technological innovation. Avenova faces substantial competition in the eye care market from companies of all sizes in the United States and abroad, including, among others, large companies such as Allergan plc and Shire plc, and against products such as Restasis, Xiidra, eye wipes, baby shampoo and soap. There are also over-the-counter products that contain hypochlorous acid that compete with Avenova. Competition may increase further as existing competitors enhance their offerings or additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with our products, particularly as the market has a heightened focus on antimicrobial products in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of our competitors have substantially more resources and a greater marketing scale than we do. We may not be able to sustain growth as competitive pressures, including pricing pressure from competitors, increase. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our operating results will materially suffer.\nRevenue generated from the KN95 Masks represents a temporary source of revenue for the Company.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we tapped into our global healthcare supply network to secure KN95 Masks. While receiving a modest profit margin on the KN95 Masks in 2020, the Company does not believe that the revenue generated from the KN95 Masks will be a long-term source of revenue for the Company. Due to increased supply, the demand for the KN95 Masks has already declined, and the Company expects such demand to continue to decline. The Company does not expect this revenue source to extend past the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business may be adversely affected if there is a default on the Payment Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loan (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d).\nWe entered into a PPP Loan with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in an aggregate principal amount of $900,505, which was established under the CARES Act. Under the terms of the CARES Act, recipients can apply for and receive forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for certain permissible purposes as set forth in the PPP, including, but not limited to, payroll costs (as defined under the PPP) and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs and the maintenance of employee and compensation levels. While we believe that we meet the qualifications for loan forgiveness, there is no assurance that the Company will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan, in whole or in part, and therefore, the Company may be liable for paying the PPP Loan back.\nThe PPP Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults or breach of representations and warranties. If the PPP Loan is not forgiven, the Company may default on the PPP Loan and trigger the immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or the Lender filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. The Company submitted the PPP loan forgiveness application in March 2021.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe rely upon information technology systems to operate our businesses. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced aspects of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states and others. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us.\nRisk Related to Government Regulation\nWe expect continuous revenue from sales of Avenova, which is classified as a cleared medical device by the FDA, but we cannot guarantee that the FDA will continue to allow us to market and sell Avenova as a cleared medical device, which would halt our sales and marketing of Avenova and cause us to lose revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our business.\nAlthough we had short-term revenue generation from the sale of KN95 Masks in 2020 and hope to receive revenue from CelleRx Clinical Reset as a lifestyle hygiene product, our ability to generate product sales will depend primarily on the commercial success of Avenova. Our ability to continue to commercialize Avenova and generate revenue depends upon, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe FDA allowing us to continue marketing Avenova as an FDA cleared medical device;\n\u25cf\nacceptance in the medical community;\n\u25cf\nthe safety of Avenova's predicate devices;\n\u25cf\nthe number of patients who use Avenova;\n\u25cf\ncoverage or reimbursement by third-party payors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully market Avenova;\n\u25cf\nreopening and resurgence of patient visits to eyecare specialists after the nationwide shelter-in-place mandates cease; and\n\u25cf\nthe amount and nature of competition from competing companies with similar products.\nThe sale of Avenova will be subject to, among other things, regulatory and commercial and market uncertainties that may be outside of our control. The clearance that we have received from the FDA for our Avenova, NeutroPhase, PhaseOne and CelleRx products is subject to strict limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed. The labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping for our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to our products will not change and thereby prevent the marketing of some or all of our products for a period of time or permanently. The FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could modify, prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or in other countries. We cannot guarantee that Avenova, our other cleared products, or products that may be approved or cleared for marketing in the future, will not be materially adversely impacted by a change in industry standards or regulations. If changes to industry standards, practices or regulations applicable to Avenova or our other cleared products that we may market and sell in the future cause a delay in continued commercialization or if we cannot make a change to satisfy the industry standards, practices or regulations, we may not be able to meet market demand which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nAdditionally, the FDA may request that we submit another 510(k) premarket submission that compares to another predicate device. If we are unable to find an adequate predicate device that is substantially equivalent to Avenova for the treatment claims that we use to sell and market Avenova, we may not be able to obtain the necessary FDA clearance to continue to market and sell Avenova without performing comprehensive clinical trials. In such event, we would need to seek premarket approval from the FDA for the applicable product before we could continue to sell and market Avenova in the United States, which would be significantly more time consuming, expensive, and uncertain.\nOur commercialized products such as Avenova and CelleRx, like our other cleared products, are not approved by the FDA as a drug, and we rely solely on the 510(k) clearance of our products as a medical device.\nOur business and future growth depend on the development, use and sale of products that are subject to FDA regulation, clearance and approval. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the use of our products, except as allowed by the FDA. As a medical device, we may only make very limited claims that pertain to our products' cleared intended use. Without claims of efficacy, market acceptance of our products may be slow. The 510(k) status of Avenova also affects our ability to obtain formal insurance reimbursement by payors, and affects our ability to obtain Medicare coverage. If and to the extent that the relaunch of CelleRx as a lifestyle hygiene product is successful, we would have similar restrictions due to the status of CelleRx as a 510(k) cleared product.\nThere is significant risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities may determine that the nature and scope of our sales and marketing activities constitutes the promotion of our products for non-FDA-approved uses in violation of applicable law and as the sale of unapproved drugs, which is prohibited under applicable law. We face the risk that the FDA may take enforcement action against us for the way that we promote and sell our products. This risk may grow with the increased visibility of Avenova online, as well as the FDA\u2019s increased focus on antimicrobial products in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also face the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authorities might pursue enforcement actions based on past activities that we have discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nGovernment investigations concerning the promotion of unapproved drug products, off-label uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if we agree to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, we would likely face significant fines and penalties and be required to substantially limit and change our sales and promotion activities.\nDevelopments after a product reaches the market may adversely affect sales of our products.\nEven after obtaining regulatory clearances, certain developments may decrease demand for our products, including the re-review of products that are already marketed; new scientific information and evolution of scientific theories; the recall or loss of regulatory clearance of products that are already marketed; changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy or labeling changes; and greater scrutiny in advertising and promotion.\nIf previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of a product, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require us to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes. In addition, some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when examining new products and are re-reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the United States, on advertising (in particular, direct to consumer advertising), promotion and pricing of pharmaceutical products. Certain regulatory changes or decisions could make it more difficult for us to sell our products. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearance, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, injunctions, warning letters, criminal prosecution and other enforcement actions. Any of these events could prevent us from marketing our products and our business may not be able to continue past such concerns. If any of the above occurs to Avenova, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capacity, and we rely on partnering arrangements or third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our products and potential products.\nThe FDA and other governmental authorities require that all of our products be manufactured in strict compliance with federal Quality Systems Regulations and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for production of our products. As a result, we have partnered with third parties to manufacture our products or rely on contract manufacturers to supply, store and distribute our products and help us meet legal requirements. As we have limited control over our commercial partners, any performance failure on their part (including failure to deliver compliant, quality components or finished goods on a timely basis) could affect the commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and reducing or delaying product revenues. If any of our commercial partners or manufacturers have violated or is alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to us, it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.\nOur products require precise, high-quality manufacturing. The failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Contract manufacturers and partners often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Accordingly, we and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA's requirements, including primarily current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d), the Quality Systems Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d), medical device reporting regulations, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards, including ISO 13485.\nThe results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form 483, untitled letters, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our FDA-cleared products are ineffective, make additional therapeutic claims that are not commensurate to the accepted labeling claims, or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could take a number of regulatory actions, including preventing us from manufacturing any or all of our devices or performing laboratory testing on human specimens, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nAvenova's FDA-clearance and our other products that have been cleared by the FDA or products that we may obtain FDA-clearance in the future, if at all, are subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed, which can reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities. In addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory clearance to one or all of our products that may be cleared in the future, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we were to lose, or have restrictions imposed on, FDA clearances we may receive in the future, our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially adversely impacted.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of regulated products, such as Avenova, NeutroPhase, PhaseOne and CelleRx, in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our regulated products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for our failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIf we experience unanticipated problems with the products, if or once approved or cleared for marketing, our products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market which may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for our cleared medical devices are subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our current suppliers, and suppliers that we may have relationships with in the future, are required to comply with the FDA's Quality Systems Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d) including for the manufacture, testing, control, quality assurance, labeling, shipping, storage, distribution and promotion of our products. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in any of the following enforcement actions against us: (1) untitled letters, Form 483 observation letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; (2) unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; (3) customer notifications for repair, replacement and refunds; (4) recall, detention or seizure of our products; (5) operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; (6) refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance of new products or modified products; (7) operating restrictions; (8) withdrawing 510(k) clearances that have already been granted; (9) refusal to grant export clearance for our products; or (10) criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it could harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, if any of our key component suppliers are not in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, we may be unable to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nDemands of third-party payors, cost reduction pressures among our customers, restrictive reimbursement practices, and cost-saving and other financial measures may adversely affect our business.\nCurrently, none of our products are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and we do not anticipate that they will be reimbursed by such programs in the future. Our ability (or inability) to negotiate favorable contracts with non-governmental payors, including managed-care plans or group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d), even if facilitated by our distributors, may significantly affect revenue and operating results. Our customers continue to face cost reduction pressures that may cause them to curtail their use of, or reimbursement for some of our products, to negotiate reduced fees or other concessions or to delay payment. In addition, third-party payors may reduce or limit reimbursement for our products in the future, such as by withdrawing their coverage policies, canceling any future contracts with us, reviewing and adjusting the rate of reimbursement, or imposing limitations on coverage. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups among non-governmental payors may reduce market prices for our products and services, thereby reducing our profitability. Reductions in price increases or the amounts received from current customers, lower pricing for our products to new customers, or limitations or reductions in reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nFederal and state healthcare reform legislation, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d may also adversely affect our business. The Affordable Care Act contains provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs in the Medicare program, such as value-based payment programs and reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions. While we cannot predict what additional healthcare programs and regulations will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation on our business, any changes that lower potential reimbursement for our products, impose additional costs, reduce the potential number of people eligible for reimbursement for the use of our products, or otherwise reduce demand for our products, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations governing the sales and marketing of our products could materially impact our revenues.\nWe engage in various marketing, promotional and educational activities pertaining to, as well as the sale of, pharmaceutical products and/or medical devices in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions outside of the United States. The promotion, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is highly regulated and the sales and marketing practices of market participants, such as us, have been subject to increasing supervision by governmental authorities, and we believe that this trend will continue.\nIn the United States, our sales and marketing activities are regulated by a number of regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, and state regulatory authorities. These authorities and agencies and their equivalents in countries outside the United States have broad authority to investigate market participants for potential violations of laws relating to the sale, marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, including the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and their state equivalents, among others, for alleged improper conduct, including corrupt payments to government officials, improper payments, inducements, and financial relationships with and to medical professionals, patients, and sales personnel, off-label marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, and the submission of false claims for reimbursement by the federal government. Any inquiries or investigations into our operations, or enforcement or other regulatory action against us by such authorities could result in significant defense costs, fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, distract management to the detriment of the business, result in the exclusion of certain products, or us, from government reimbursement programs or subject us to regulatory controls or government monitoring of our activities in the future.\nFailure to obtain and/or maintain required licenses or registrations could reduce revenue.\nOur business is subject to a variety of licensing or registration requirements by the FDA, certain states and foreign jurisdictions where our products are distributed. Failure to obtain or maintain required licenses could result in the termination of the sale of certain products in the applicable states or foreign jurisdictions, or the termination of such products. We may also be subject to fines and other penalties imposed by the relevant government authorities for non-compliance.\nThe process for obtaining licenses or registrations can be lengthy and expensive and the results sometimes are unpredictable. If we are unable to obtain licenses or registrations needed to produce, market and sell our products in a timely fashion, or at all, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and the failure to comply with such laws may adversely affect our business.\nWe could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: (i) the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which applies to our marketing and research practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other persons and entities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (ii) federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and from offering or transferring remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of any item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by Medicare or a state healthcare program; (iii) HIPAA, which, among other things, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; (iv) HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and places restrictions on the use of such information for marketing communications; (v) the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which among other things, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under a federal healthcare program to report annually information related to \u201cpayments or other transfers of value\u201d made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by certain healthcare professionals and their immediate family members; (vi) the government pricing rules and price reporting laws applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs program, and the TRICARE program; and (vii) state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, and state and foreign price and payment reporting and disclosure laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by their federal counterparts, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violations of the health information privacy and fraud and abuse laws may result in severe penalties against us and/or our responsible employees, including jail sentences, large fines, and the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federal and state programs. Defense of litigation claims and government investigations can be costly, time consuming, and distract management, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements that would require us to change the way we operate our business.\nAny adverse outcome in these types of actions, or the imposition of penalties or sanctions for failing to comply with health information privacy or fraud and abuse laws, could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Potential Litigation\nThe pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by patent litigation, and any litigation or claim against us may impose substantial costs on us, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights. For the most part, these lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents. We rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position, and we may initiate claims to defend our intellectual property rights as a result. Other parties may have issued patents or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or know-how or require us to license such patents and pay significant fees or royalties to produce our products. In addition, future patents may be issued to third parties which our technology may infringe. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and because patent applications are not published for a period of time, or in some cases at all, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe.\nIntellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, would divert management's attention from our business and could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If a dispute involving our proprietary technology were resolved against us, it could mean the earlier entry of some or all third parties seeking to compete in the marketplace for a given product, and a consequent significant decrease in the price we could charge for our product. If such a dispute alleging that our technology or operations infringed third-party patent rights were to be resolved against us, we might be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney's fees if we were found to have willfully infringed a third party's patent, to the party claiming infringement, to develop non-infringing technology, to stop selling any products we develop, to cease using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or to enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all.\nIf our product or products cause an unexpected reaction to a patient or patients in certain ways that may have caused or contributed to serious injury, we may be subject to product liability claims, and if product liability lawsuits are brought against us, they could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nDespite all reasonable efforts to ensure safety, it is possible that we or our distributors will sell our products or products that we currently do not sell but may sell in the future, which are defective, to which patients/customers react in an unexpected manner, or which are alleged to have side effects or otherwise not work for the product\u2019s intended purpose. The manufacture and sale of such products may expose us to potential liability, including regulatory enforcement actions, and the industries in which our products are likely to be sold have been subject to significant product liability litigation.\nAny claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our management's time and attention, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, business and results of operations. We cannot make assurances that any liability insurance coverage that we qualify for, if at all, will fully satisfy any liabilities brought for any event or injury that is attributed to our product or products.\nIf a product liability claim is brought against us, we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim and, if the claim is successful, damage awards may not be covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance. We may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets. We may also be obligated to indemnify our collaborators and make payments to other parties with respect to product liability damages and claims. Defending any product liability claims, or indemnifying others against those claims, could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products similar to ours that may reduce demand for our products.\nOur success, competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in significant part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. We apply for patents covering our technologies as we deem appropriate.\nThere is no assurance that any patents issued to us, or in-licensed or assigned to us by third parties will not be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us. If we or our collaborators or licensors fail to file, prosecute, obtain or maintain certain patents, our competitors could market products that contain features and clinical benefits similar to those of any products we develop, and demand for our products could decline as a result. Further, although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, third parties may be able to design around our patents or, if they do infringe upon our technology, we may not be successful or have sufficient resources in pursuing a claim of infringement against those third parties. Any pursuit of an infringement claim by us may involve substantial expense and diversion of management attention.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. If these agreements are not enforceable, or are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nWe operate in the State of California. California law prevents us from imposing a delay before an employee, who may have access to trade secrets and proprietary know-how, can commence employment with a competing company. Although we may be able to pursue legal action against competitive companies improperly using our proprietary information, we may not be aware of any use of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how until after significant damage has been done to our Company.\nFurthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If our intellectual property does not provide significant protection against foreign or domestic competition, our competitors, including generic manufacturers, could compete more directly with us, which could result in a decrease in our market share. All of these factors may harm our competitive position.", "PERMNO": 92345, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NBY"}
