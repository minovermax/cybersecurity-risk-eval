RISK FACTORS\nContinuation of current and projected future business environment\nThe overall pump industry is cyclical in nature, and some of its business activity is related to general business conditions in the durable goods and capital equipment markets. Demand for most of the Company\u2019s products and services is affected by the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by its customers. The level of such expenditures by our customers depends, in turn, on general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Also, volatility in commodity prices such as oil and agricultural products can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. Additionally, raw material and energy are substantive drivers of costs in the manufacture of pumps and changes of these costs are often unpredictable. While efforts are made to recoup higher production costs through increased prices, the future acceptability of such price increases by customers is not guaranteed due to the highly competitive market place.\nCompliance with, and costs related to, a variety of import and export laws and regulations\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws regarding international operations, including regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and various foreign governmental agencies. Actual or alleged violations of import-export laws could result in enforcement actions and financial penalties. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations and trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Future regulations could limit the countries in which certain of our products may be manufactured or sold or could restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, products from foreign sources.\nInternational operations exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nApproximately 10% of the Company\u2019s revenue and certain of its costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary currencies to which the Company has exposure are the Canadian Dollar, the Euro and the South African Rand. Devaluations of these currencies can reduce the value of the Company\u2019s local monetary assets, reduce the U.S. dollar value of its local cash flow, and generate local currency losses that may reduce the U.S. dollar value\nPART I - CONTINUED\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - CONTINUED\nof future local net income. Historically these exchange rate fluctuations have not materially affected our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities\nThe Company\u2019s operations and properties are subject to numerous, and increasing, domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations which can impose operating and financial sanctions for violations. Moreover, environmental and sustainability initiatives, practices, rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non-governmental bodies and may require changes in operational practices, standards and expectations and in turn increase the Company\u2019s compliance costs. Periodically, the Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements. The Company monitors its environmental responsibilities, together with trends in the related laws, and believes it is in substantial compliance with current regulations. The Company believes that reasonably anticipated future environmental compliance expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDefined benefit pension plan settlement expense\nThe Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering most domestic employees and accrues amounts for funding of its obligations under the plan. The defined benefit pension plan allows eligible retiring employees to receive a lump-sum distribution for benefits earned in lieu of annual payments and most retirees elect this option. Under applicable accounting rules, if the lump-sum distributions made for a plan year exceed an actuarially-determined threshold of the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, the Company at such point would need to recognize for that year\u2019s results of operations a settlement expense for the resulting unrecognized actuarial loss. The Company has been required to make such adjustments in some prior years and, if such non-cash adjustments are necessary in future periods, they may be comparably adverse to the Company\u2019s operating results.\nFamily ownership of common equity\nA substantial percentage of the Company\u2019s Common Shares is held by various members of the Gorman and Rupp families and their affiliates. These family holdings do not typically trade; therefore, the Common Shares, in part because of these circumstances, generally have a history of relatively low volume trading experiences on the NYSE MKT Exchange.", "PERMNO": 53604, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "GRC"}
