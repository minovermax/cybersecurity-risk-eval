Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects, as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. Certain statements contained in this section constitute forward-looking statements. See the information included in \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe currently depend entirely on the successful and timely regulatory approval from the FDA and commercialization of our r-SNM System, our only product. Our r-SNM System may not receive FDA regulatory approval or we may be significantly delayed in receiving regulatory approval. Even if we receive regulatory approval, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System.\nWe currently have only one product, our r-SNM System, and our business presently depends entirely on our ability to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA for our r-SNM System and to successfully commercialize it in a timely manner. We have no other products currently approved for sale and we may never be able to develop marketable products or enhancements to our r-SNM System. We are not permitted to market our r-SNM System in the United States until we receive approval from the FDA. We do not know if or when we will receive such approval or whether we will need to make modifications to our r-SNM System, generate additional data to submit to the FDA, or incur significant additional expenditures to obtain any such approval.\nOur near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our company and generate revenue, as well as our future growth, depend entirely on the successful and timely regulatory approval from the FDA and commercialization of our r-SNM System. The regulatory and commercial success of our r-SNM System will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nwhether we are required by the FDA or other similar regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical studies or to modify the design of our current studies to support the approval of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nour success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and other similar regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nthe ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed, to support the commercial launch of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance by physicians and patients of the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire a sufficient number of talented sales representatives to sell our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our current manufacturers and any third parties with whom we may contract to manufacture our r-SNM System to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with applicable requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of competing products, such as InterStim II, or competing third-line therapies, such as BOTOX injections and PTNS.\nFor example, as part of the IDE approval process for our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study, the FDA recommended that we should make several modifications to the study design in order for the study to serve as the primary clinical support for a future marketing approval. Specifically, despite our responses and supporting documentation that we submitted in support of our study design, the FDA reiterated its previously expressed recommendations that we make the following modifications to our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study:\n\u2022\nexclude patients with mixed urinary incontinence (\u201cMUI\u201d), which means a patient has both stress urinary incontinence and UUI;\n\u2022\nuse either a seven-day bladder diary or two separate three-day bladder diaries;\n\u2022\nuse a 12-month primary effectiveness endpoint in order to account for the placebo effect and enable assessment of durability of the treatment effect;\n\u2022\nuse all patients in whom an implant is attempted, not initial responders after one month, for primary efficacy analysis;\n\u2022\nuse multiple imputation to account for missing primary endpoint data;\n\u2022\nrevise the protocol to include details on statistical analysis methods for analyzing the primary and secondary endpoints, analysis population, method for handling missing endpoint data and sensitivities and poolability analyses;\n\u2022\nuse a two-sided 95% confidence interval; and\n\u2022\nprovide further justification for restarting with a new activation date after a lead issue.\nIn response, we engaged with the FDA regarding its recommendation, including our latest IDE supplement, which we submitted to the FDA in September 2018 to address certain of its recommendations. As a result, we incorporated a number of recommended study modifications. However, to date we elected not to incorporate several of the recommended modifications based on what we believe are currently accepted urology practice guidelines and the design of previous OAB clinical studies accepted by the FDA. We believe certain of these modifications would have resulted in a study design that increased study site and patient burdens, decreased the feasibility of enrollment or were not clearly supported by available peer-reviewed literature or currently accepted urology practice guidelines. At this point in the study, some of the FDA\u2019s recommendations cannot be implemented. For example, we cannot exclude patients with MUI and we cannot change the three-day bladder diaries taken at baseline to seven-day bladder diaries. On October 19, 2018, the FDA approved our latest IDE supplement and removed certain of its prior study design recommendations while reiterating several others. On November 9, 2018, we filed an additional IDE supplement with the FDA regarding certain of its reiterated recommendations, and the response from the FDA is pending.\nWe completed enrollment of patients for the ARTISAN-SNM study in June of 2018. The approved protocol from the FDA based on our September 2018 IDE supplement incorporated certain of the FDA\u2019s recommended study design considerations. Although we have not modified the ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study design to address all of the considerations that the FDA has reiterated, based on the study results to date, we believe we will be able to satisfy the FDA with reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM system to support its marketing approval. However, it is possible that the FDA may not consider the results to be sufficiently strong or that, in part due to its concerns with our study design, the FDA will not accept the data as a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain marketing approval of our r-SNM System. If we intend to modify the study design to address any of the above FDA considerations that we have not already addressed, we will be required to obtain FDA approval of an IDE supplement before implementing the changes, which could result in significant delays. The approval requirements for an IDE supplement are generally the same as an original IDE, and they are approved if the FDA does not object within 30 days. We would also be required to get IRB approval of the protocol changes if the changes involve the rights, safety, or welfare of the patients, and some investigators may determine that local rules require additional approvals from a local IRB.\nIn addition, incorporating modifications may be costly or not possible at this point in the ongoing clinical study or lead to delays in obtaining approval from the FDA, which may be significant and adversely and materially affect our ability to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System. Further, even if we make changes to the study design to address these considerations, the FDA may not approve our r-SNM System.\nWe initially submitted a literature-based PMA on January 9, 2018, in which we claimed equivalence to InterStim II based on the review of technical specifications, published clinical studies, and other information. On May 9, 2018, the FDA responded to our initial literature-based PMA and requested that we submit additional information to demonstrate that our r-SNM System is sufficiently similar to InterStim II, as well as asking us to address a number of other matters. On October 18, 2018, we responded to the FDA and withdrew our initial literature-based PMA. On December 3, 2018, we submitted a new literature-based PMA claiming equivalence to InterStim II. This literature-based PMA was based on reasonable safety and effectiveness data from a literature review. In this PMA filing, we submitted existing literature reporting on InterStim II. In addition to the technical specifications, testing data and published literature, we included one-year follow-up data from our 51-patient RELAX-OAB European post-market clinical follow-up study to support the PMA, and subsequently provided the FDA with the clinical results on the first 60 patients to reach their six-month primary endpoint from our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study. This PMA filing incorporates all elements of the r-SNM System, the External Trial System, and related accessories, as well as the additional information addressing FDA\u2019s questions in its May 9, 2018 correspondence. Since the PMA submission on December 3, 2018, we have submitted various amendments to the PMA. These amendments include data in support\nof conditional full-body MRI labeling, and complete three-month and six-month clinical data from the ARTISAN-SNM study.\nIn addition to this, on March 1, 2019, we submitted a new literature-based PMA seeking approval for FI. This PMA is also based on an existing literature review of Interstim II.\nIf we do not successfully address the FDA\u2019s suggested considerations or other questions that arise during the FDA review process and obtain FDA approval, and for some changes, obtain IRB approval, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays in obtaining marketing approval from the FDA for our r-SNM System or not obtain approval at all. Even if FDA regulatory approval is obtained, we may never be able to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System.\nWe have derived minimal revenue from our operations and incurred significant operating losses since inception, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are a medical technology company with a limited operating history. To date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts in the research and development of, seeking regulatory approval for, and commercial planning for our r-SNM System. We are not profitable and have incurred losses each year since we began our operations in 2013. We have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. Consequently, any predictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or an approved product on the market in the United States. To date, we have not obtained regulatory approval for our r-SNM System in the United States or generated meaningful revenue from sales of our r-SNM System outside the United States.\nWe have not derived meaningful revenue from our operations, as our activities have consisted primarily of developing our technology and conducting clinical studies. As a result, we have recorded net losses of $32.5 million and $18.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $99.6 million. To date, we have financed our operations through equity financings, including our October 2018 initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), and amounts borrowed under our Loan Agreement (defined below). We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to research and development activities as well as general and administrative expenses associated with our operations, including clinical and regulatory initiatives to obtain marketing approval.\nWe expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we (i) build our commercial infrastructure, (ii) develop, enhance, seek FDA regulatory approval for, and begin to commercialize, if approved, our r-SNM System in the United States, (iii) increase our commercialization efforts internationally, and (iv) incur additional operational costs associated with being a public company. For example, we are in the process of hiring a specialty sales force of approximately 100 sales professionals, regional sales managers and clinical specialists in advance of the anticipated commercial launch of our r-SNM System in the United States, and expect to grow our sales force over time and the number of our sales representatives at commercial launch will vary and may be higher depending on the duration of the PMA review process. If we are delayed in obtaining approval of our r-SNM System by the FDA, we may be required to offer increased compensation to our U.S. sales team in order to retain them, which would further increase our operational costs. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our expected future operating losses, combined with our prior operating losses, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nIf approved by the FDA, we expect that sales of our r-SNM System will account for the substantial majority of our future revenue. If our r-SNM System does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients and does not receive adequate reimbursement from third party payors, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in subsequent periods or on an ongoing basis. If we do not achieve or sustain profitability, it will be more difficult for us to finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives, either of which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur r-SNM System is currently our sole product, and we are completely dependent on the success of our r-SNM System. We have limited experience marketing and selling our r-SNM System, and we may have difficulty commercializing our r-SNM System and generating product revenue.\nOur r-SNM System is currently our sole product, and we are completely dependent on its success. Successfully commercializing medical devices such as ours is a complex and uncertain process. Our commercialization efforts will depend on the efforts of our management and sales team, our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, physicians and hospitals, and general economic conditions, among other factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain regulatory approval in the United States for our r-SNM System for the treatment of UUI;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing and sales efforts in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nour third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to manufacture and supply the components of our r-SNM System in a timely manner and in accordance with our specifications;\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety, and relative efficacy of alternative and competing therapies;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in and to our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments, and our need to enhance our r-SNM System and/or develop new products to maintain market share in response to such competing technologies or market developments;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our r-SNM System; and\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully conduct additional clinical studies as may be required by the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities to enable our r-SNM System to be approved for additional indications.\nWe currently have a limited sales and marketing organization outside the United States and are in the process of building our sales and marketing organization in the United States. We began marketing and selling our r-SNM System in certain limited European markets in 2018. As a result, we have limited experience marketing and selling our r-SNM System. We currently sell our r-SNM System through a limited direct sales force in Europe, that targets physicians and hospitals. As of December 31, 2018, our limited direct sales organization in Europe consisted of five employees.\nIn order to generate future revenue growth, we plan to expand the size and geographic scope of our sales and marketing organization. Our future success will depend largely on our ability to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales, marketing and reimbursement personnel with significant industry experience and technical knowledge of implantable devices and related products. Because the competition for their services is high, we may not be able to hire and retain additional personnel on favorable or commercially reasonable terms. If we are delayed in obtaining approval of our r-SNM System by the FDA, we may be required to offer increased compensation to our U.S. sales team in order to retain them. Notwithstanding, we may lose members of our sales team who do want or are not able to wait until we obtain approval from the FDA without actively selling our product or earning less than they would otherwise if our product were approved in the United States. Our failure to hire or retain qualified sales, marketing and reimbursement personnel would prevent us from expanding our business and generating revenue.\nOnce hired, the training process for sales representatives can be lengthy because it requires significant education for new sales representatives to achieve the level of clinical competency with our product expected by physicians. Upon completion of the training, we expect that the sales representatives would require lead time in the field to grow their network of accounts and achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach in any individual territory. Furthermore, the use of our product will often require or benefit from direct support from us. If we are unable to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel, and if our sales representatives do not achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach, our revenue will not grow at the rate we expect and our financial performance will suffer. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from our competitor, we may have to wait until applicable non-competition provisions have expired before deploying such personnel in restricted territories or incur costs to relocate personnel outside of such territories. This may subject us to allegations that these new hires have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged to us proprietary or other confidential information of their former employers.\nAddressing such allegations would be costly both in terms of time and resources. Any of these risks may adversely affect our business.\nIf we are not successful in recruiting sales, marketing and reimbursement personnel or building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our r-SNM System, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are not successful in commercializing our r-SNM System, our future product revenue will suffer and we would likely incur significant additional losses. Any factors that adversely impact the commercialization of our r-SNM System will have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to finance our planned operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. As a result, we may not be able to implement our planned sales and marketing program to increase the adoption of our r-SNM System.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, primarily due to our research and development activities and conducting clinical studies for our r-SNM System. We expect these activities and the associated expenses to continue. We also expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our plan to commercialize our r-SNM System in the United States and hire qualified personnel. Additional expenditures will also include costs associated with manufacturing and supply, sales and marketing costs, costs and expenses incidental to being a public company, and general operations. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $157.5 million. We believe that the net proceeds from our IPO, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will fund our projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain regulatory approval in the United States for our r-SNM System for the treatment of UUI and the associated costs;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with manufacturing, selling, and marketing our r-SNM System for the treatment of UUI in the United States, if approved by the FDA, and for other indications for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval, including the cost and timing of implementing our sales and marketing plan and expanding our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively market and sell, and achieve sufficient market acceptance and market share for, our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nthe costs to establish, maintain, expand, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, as well as any other action required in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments, and our need to enhance our r-SNM System and/or develop new products to maintain market share in response to such competing technologies or market developments;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to complete post-market studies that could be required by regulatory authorities or other studies required to obtain clearance for additional indications;\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt, and amount of license fees and sales of, or royalties on, or future improvements on our r-SNM System, if any; and\n\u2022\nour need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial, compliance, and reporting systems, incidental to being a public company.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or alternatively we may seek to raise only equity capital. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our\nstockholders\u2019 rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or liens, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our r-SNM System, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed and on terms that are acceptable to us, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend the implementation of our sales and marketing plan and our ongoing research and development efforts, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on the License Agreement to provide us with rights to use the AMF IP to develop and commercialize the AMF Licensed Products, which are used in our r-SNM System. Any termination or loss of significant rights under the License Agreement would materially and adversely affect our development and commercialization of our r-SNM System.\nOn October 1, 2013, we entered into the License Agreement pursuant to which AMF granted us a royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to the AMF IP. The license to the AMF IP allows Axonics to make, have made, lease, offer to lease, use, sell, offer for sale, market, promote, advertise, import, research, develop and commercialize the AMF Licensed Products worldwide for the treatment of:\n(i)\nurinary and fecal dysfunction in humans through the application of electrical energy anywhere in or on the human body;\n(ii)\nchronic pain in humans through the application of electrical energy to the nervous system; and\n(iii)\ninflammatory conditions of the human body through the application of electrical energy to the vagus nerve,\nexcluding, in each case, any product or method that involves the placement of electrodes or the administration of electrical stimulation inside the cranial cavity or to the ocular nervous system or the auditory nervous system.\nWe have the right to expand the field of use for the AMF Licensed Products to modulation of digestive process and treatment of digestive conditions in humans through the application of electrical energy anywhere in or on the body, subject to the exclusions described above.\nGenerally, the license is non-transferable without the prior written consent of AMF, except to an affiliate of our company or in connection with the acquisition of our company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale or otherwise) or the part of our business to which the License Agreement relates, provided that the assignee agrees in writing to be bound to the terms of the License Agreement to which we are bound.\nWe granted to AMF a royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable, perpetual, exclusive license to the Axonics Licensed IP. This license granted by us to AMF explicitly excludes uses of the Axonics Licensed IP that are within the scope of the exclusive license of the AMF IP granted by AMF to us. Such license is irrevocable unless we terminate the License Agreement and AMF does not agree to pay us compensation for such license mutually agreed between us and AMF or determined by arbitration in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement. To date we have not made any improvements to the inventions claimed in the AMF IP that constitute Axonics Licensed IP.\nIn addition, the License Agreement provides AMF with the AMF Option, to license from us any intellectual property owned by us or otherwise in our control that is related to electrical stimulation of human tissue, separate from the Axonics Licensed IP and AMF IP, on terms that are materially consistent with the terms upon which we license the AMF IP pursuant to the License Agreement, and subject to field of use restrictions that would be determined upon the exercise of the AMF Option. AMF has expressly declined in writing to exercise the AMF Option.\nUnder the License Agreement, for each calendar year beginning in 2018, we are obligated to pay AMF the greater of (i) 4% of all net revenue derived from the AMF Licensed Products, and (ii) a minimum annual royalty (the \u201cMinimum Royalty\u201d), payable quarterly. As of December 31, 2018, we have accrued $0.1 million toward the Minimum Royalty. The Minimum Royalty will automatically increase each year after 2018, subject to a maximum amount of $200,000 per year. We have 60 days to pay AMF the royalty amount due under the License Agreement, and if we fail\nto pay AMF within such 60-day period, AMF may, at its election, convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license or terminate the License Agreement.\nThe initial term of the License Agreement is from October 1, 2013 to October 1, 2033, and will automatically continue until all patents are no longer in force. Upon completion of the initial term, the license granted pursuant to the License Agreement will be fully paid-up and perpetual except that if we wish to continue to practice any of the patents licensed to us by AMF that remain in force after such initial term, then we will have to continue to pay a reduced royalty for so long as such patent remains in force.\nEach party may terminate the License Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of any obligation under the License Agreement and such breach is not cured within 90 days following receipt of notice of such breach from the other party. AMF may terminate the License Agreement upon (i) notice to us in the event we challenge or assist any other person or entity in challenging the patentability, enforceability or validity of any of the AMF patents licensed to us under the License Agreement, subject to certain exceptions including challenges that we are not infringing any such AMF patent, and (ii) upon our filing of or the institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of our assets for the benefit of creditors, and in the case of involuntary bankruptcy, in the event we consent to such bankruptcy and it is not dismissed within 90 days. Lastly, we may terminate the License Agreement in full for any reason effective upon 60 days written notice to AMF.\nThe License Agreement was amended twice in February 2014 in order to, among other things, include the field of the treatment of urinary and fecal dysfunction in humans through the application of electrical energy anywhere in or on the human body, within the scope of the licenses granted therein.\nThe agreement allows for AMF the right to use the AMF IP for non-commercial research, educational and scholarly purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, AMF holds 2,102,970 shares of our common stock. John Petrovich, a former member of our board of directors who retired from the board in early March 2019, is the President, Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President, Business Development and General Counsel of AMF.\nWe are reliant on a single product and if we are not successful in commercializing our r-SNM System our business will not succeed.\nOur success depends completely on our r-SNM System, which is our sole product. We currently have no other product available for sale. If our r-SNM System is not successful at a level sufficient to generate a profit and we are unable to develop additional products or compelling enhancements to our r-SNM System to generate additional profit, our business will not succeed.\nFor over 20 years, physicians and patients have relied on the only approved SNM therapy offered by Medtronic, InterStim II and its predecessor, InterStim. As our r-SNM System will be a new product in the SNM market, our primary strategy to penetrate the market and grow our revenue is to drive physician and patient awareness of the material benefits of our r-SNM System. Physicians and patients may choose not to adopt our r-SNM System for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfamiliarity with InterStim II or preference for any new device for the treatment of SNM that Medtronic could develop and commercialize in the future;\n\u2022\ninability to use our r-SNM System on-label for additional unapproved indications;\n\u2022\nlack of experience with our r-SNM System and with SNM as a treatment alternative;\n\u2022\nour inability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding our r-SNM System, or to convince physicians and patients that it is an attractive alternative to InterStim II and other third-line therapies such as BOTOX injections and PTNS;\n\u2022\nperceived or actual benefits of InterStim II;\n\u2022\nperceived inadequacy of evidence supporting the clinical benefits or cost-effectiveness of our r-SNM System over existing alternatives;\n\u2022\ninability to charge our r-SNM System or preference for a non-rechargeable device, such as InterStim II;\n\u2022\nmarketing and other efforts by Medtronic targeting physicians, including those with whom they have long-term relationships; and\n\u2022\nineffectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts for our r-SNM System.\nIn addition, patients may choose not to adopt SNM therapy as a potential therapy if, among other potential reasons, their anatomy would not allow for effective treatment with our r-SNM System, they are reluctant to receive an implantable device as opposed to an alternative, non-implantable treatment, or they are worried about potential adverse effects of SNM therapy, such as infection, discomfort from the stimulation, or soreness or weakness.\nWe intend to focus the majority of our sales and marketing efforts in the United States where reimbursement for SNM therapy is well established and covered by most major U.S. insurers. We are in the process of building a dedicated direct sales organization, which will initially target the estimated 1,000 physician specialists that represent a majority of the implant volume in the United States. We estimate that approximately 80% of U.S. implant volume is generated by these 1,000 physicians. We are in the process of hiring a specialty sales force of approximately 100 sales professionals, regional sales managers and clinical specialists in advance of the anticipated commercial launch of our r-SNM System in the United States. In addition, we plan to expand our current sales team into select international markets.\nWe also expect to conduct direct-to-patient marketing efforts to drive patient awareness of SNM therapy in general and our r-SNM System in particular. We believe that approximately 40% of people in the United States and Europe with OAB seek treatment, as they may be embarrassed to talk to their doctor about their symptoms and may even believe that their symptoms are untreatable. We intend to educate patients on the availability of SNM therapy as a treatment for the symptoms of OAB and FI in an effort to promote dialogue between patients and physicians about the existence of these symptoms in the first instance. Simultaneously we intend to educate physicians on the material benefits of our r-SNM System over InterStim II, which include, among others, longer battery life, smaller and lighter INS, constant current technology, improved patient experience, and simplified physician implantation and programming. We believe that educating healthcare providers and patients about the clinical merits and patient benefits of our r-SNM System as a treatment for OAB will be key elements driving adoption of our r-SNM System. However, some physicians may have prior history with or a preference for other treatment options. Moreover, our efforts to educate the medical community and patients on the benefits of our r-SNM System will require significant resources and we may never be successful. If healthcare providers and patients do not adopt our r-SNM System, and our r-SNM System does not achieve broad market acceptance, our ability to execute our growth strategy will be impaired, and our business and future prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe will compete against other companies offering first-, second- and third-line therapies for the treatment of OAB, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products or greater resources than we do, which may prevent us from achieving increased market penetration and improved operating results.\nWe believe our r-SNM System is designed to offer several needed improvements in the SNM market for patients, physicians, and payors. However, the medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.\nWe consider our primary competition to be implantable SNM devices. InterStim II is currently the only implantable SNM device approved for commercial sale in the United States by the FDA. We also compete with other third-line treatments, such as BOTOX injections, a product sold by Allergan plc, PTNS, as well as more invasive surgical treatment options, and drugs for the treatment of OAB and FI. We face competition from major medical device companies worldwide, many of which have longer, more established operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources. Our overall competitive position is dependent upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ncompany, product and brand recognition;\n\u2022\nhistory of product use and physician familiarity with products and treatments;\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals and approved indications;\n\u2022\nproduct safety, reliability and durability;\n\u2022\nINS size, rechargeability and battery life;\n\u2022\nquality and volume of clinical data;\n\u2022\neffective marketing to and education of patients, physicians and hospitals;\n\u2022\nproduct ease of use and patient comfort;\n\u2022\nphysician implantation and programming process;\n\u2022\nsales force experience and market access;\n\u2022\nproduct support and service;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;\n\u2022\npricing and revenue strategies;\n\u2022\nprocedure costs to patients and the overall healthcare system; and\n\u2022\ndedicated practice development.\nIn addition to existing competitors, other larger and more established companies may acquire or in-license competitive products and could directly compete with us. These competitors may also try to compete with our r-SNM System on price both directly, through rebates and promotional programs to high volume physicians and coupons to patients, and indirectly, through attractive product bundling with complimentary products that offer convenience and an effectively lower price compared to the total price of purchasing each product separately. Larger competitors may also be able to offer greater customer loyalty benefits to encourage repeat use of their products and finance a sustained global advertising campaign to compete with commercialization efforts of our r-SNM System. Our competitors may seek to discredit our r-SNM System by challenging our short operating history or relatively limited number of scientific studies and publications. Additionally, certain of our competitors may challenge our intellectual property, may develop additional competing or superior technologies and processes and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our market, there is the possibility of a competitor acquiring patents or other rights that may limit our ability to update our technologies and products which may impact demand for our r-SNM System.\nWe intend to compete against InterStim II and any future commercially available implantable SNM devices by offering material advantages over existing technology. Such advantages may not be readily adopted by the market and we may need to compete based on price or other factors, at which we may be unsuccessful.\nWe believe that our r-SNM System\u2019s innovative and proprietary design offers significant competitive and functional advantages over InterStim II. We believe that our r-SNM System is the first and only system for SNM therapy with a rechargeable INS battery that is designed to last approximately 15 years. As a result, patients implanted with our r-SNM System do not need to undergo replacement surgery every three to five years, as is the case for patients implanted with the non-rechargeable InterStim II. Our proprietary method of combining ceramic and titanium for the INS enclosure enables us to incorporate a significantly smaller recharging coil into our INS, which offers benefits such as 60% smaller size and half the weight of InterStim II and enhanced communication range. In addition, our r-SNM System employs constant current, automatically adapting stimulation output to the body\u2019s physiological changes, which we expect will provide a more consistent and reliable therapy over time and reduce patient and physician management of the therapy. Further, our r-SNM System is differentiated by significant wireless charging benefits and an easy-to-use patient remote control. Finally, we designed and custom built a touchscreen clinician programmer that guides the implanting physician through electrode placement and stimulation programming. Our clinician programmer allows physicians to connect to a patient\u2019s INS, while the patient is in the physician\u2019s care, to access key therapy data that is stored and maintained on the INS.\nHowever, these advantages may not be perceived as well as we expect by patients and physicians. As a result, we may need to compete on the basis of price or other factors, which may negatively impact market reaction to our r-SNM System. For example, the decreasing prices may cause patients and physicians to perceive our r-SNM System to be of lower quality than InterStim II, which could limit widespread adoption and acceptance of our r-SNM System.\nMoreover, price competition would also likely render sales of our r-SNM System less profitable. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur long-term growth depends, in part, on our ability to develop and enhance our r-SNM System, and if we fail to do so we may be unable to compete effectively.\nIt is important to our business and our long-term growth that we continue to develop and enhance our r-SNM System. We intend to continue to invest in research and development activities focused on improvements and enhancements to our r-SNM System. Our goals include extending the time between recharging sessions to once a month, introducing features that would enable us to connect our INS to an already implanted InterStim II lead, and expanding the suite of product solutions available for SNM therapy over time. Additionally, we intend to pursue regulatory approval for other indications in the United States in the future.\nDeveloping enhancements to our r-SNM System can be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from the commercialization of our r-SNM System and divert financial resources from other operations. The success of any new product enhancements, including approval of our r-SNM System for additional indications, will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs, and develop new product enhancements to meet those needs;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate, if required, the safety and effectiveness of new enhancements to our r-SNM System, including additional indications, with data from preclinical studies and clinical studies;\n\u2022\nobtain, and obtain in a timely manner, the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new enhancements to our r-SNM System, product modifications or expanded indications for our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\navoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties;\n\u2022\nbe fully FDA-compliant with marketing of new devices or modified products;\n\u2022\ncompetitive counter moves advanced by Medtronic to secure and maintain customers;\n\u2022\ndevelop an effective and dedicated sales and marketing team to provide adequate education and training to potential users of our r-SNM System; and\n\u2022\nreceive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our r-SNM System.\nIf we are not successful in commercializing our r-SNM System, expanding the indications for which it may be approved and developing and commercializing new product enhancements, our ability to achieve and maintain market share and increase our revenue may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and we may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nWe have been growing rapidly in recent periods and have a relatively short history of operating as a commercial company. As of December 31, 2018, we had 87 employees. We expect to hire and train new personnel as we continue to grow and expand our operations. Primarily, we plan to build a specialized and dedicated direct sales organization. We are in the process of hiring a specialty sales force of approximately 100 sales professionals, regional sales managers and clinical specialists in advance of the anticipated commercial launch of our r-SNM System in the United States. In addition, we plan to expand our current sales team into select international markets. However, we may not be able to hire a sufficient number of sales representatives to support our U.S. commercial operations in time for commercial launch or at all. Further, we expect to grow our sales force over time. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively, or to hire a sufficient number of sales representatives, could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nTo achieve our revenue goals, we must successfully increase manufacturing output to meet expected customer demand. In the future, we may experience difficulties with manufacturing yields, quality control, component supply and shortages of qualified personnel, among other problems. These problems could result in delays in product availability and increases in expenses. Any such delay or increased expense could adversely affect our ability to generate our\nrevenue. Future growth will also impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. In addition, rapid and significant growth will place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. In order to manage our operations and growth we will need to continue to improve our operational, compliance and management controls, reporting and information technology systems and financial internal control procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our operating results and business could suffer.\nIn addition, as a public company, we will need to support managerial, operational, financial and other resources to manage our operations, commercialize our r-SNM System and continue our research and development activities. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth, and this growth may place significant strain on us as we grow. Successful growth will also be dependent upon our ability to implement appropriate financial and management controls. Due to our limited experience in managing a company with anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert the attention of our management and business development resources. If we fail to manage these challenges effectively, there may be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the quality of our r-SNM System does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation or our business could be adversely affected.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our r-SNM System, including defects in third-party components included in our r-SNM System. Although we have established internal procedures designed to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, we may not be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. In addition, even in the absence of quality issues, we may be subject to claims and liability if the performance of our r-SNM System does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients. For example, the anticipated battery life of our r-SNM System will vary based on usage and therapy settings. The battery is designed to last for approximately 15 years, but it may be shorter if a patient\u2019s required therapy results in the device being used in excess of normal use conditions or if other physical battery failures occur. If the quality of our r-SNM System does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation with those physicians or patients, and our business, financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely affected.\nThe size and future growth in the market for SNM therapy has not been established with precision and may be smaller than we estimate. If our estimates and projections overestimate the size of this market, our sales growth may be adversely affected.\nOur estimates of the size and future growth in the market for SNM therapy, including the number of people in the United States and Europe who suffer from symptoms of either OAB or FI and who are readily treatable with and eligible candidates for SNM therapy, is based on a number of internal and third-party studies, reports and estimates. In addition, our internal estimates are based in large part on current treatment patterns by healthcare providers using SNM therapy and our belief that the incidence of OAB and FI in the United States, Europe and worldwide is increasing. While we believe these factors have historically provided and may continue to provide us with effective tools in estimating the total market for SNM therapy and our r-SNM System, these estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. The actual numbers of people with OAB and FI who are readily treatable with and eligible candidates for SNM therapy, and the actual demand for our r-SNM System or competitive products, could differ materially from our projections if our assumptions are incorrect. As a result, our estimates of the size and future growth in the market for our r-SNM System may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of people with OAB and FI who would benefit from our r-SNM System and the size and future growth in the market for our r-SNM System is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our projected sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, while we have regulatory approvals in Europe, Canada, and Australia for OAB, FI, and UR, we initially intend to pursue regulatory approval in the United States for UUI, a predominant OAB subtype, and we intend to seek regulatory approval for other indications in the United States in the future.\nWe may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third-parties that may not result in the development of commercially viable products or product improvements or the generation of significant future revenues.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, partnerships or other arrangements to develop new products or product improvements and to pursue new markets. Proposing, negotiating and implementing collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. We may not identify, secure, or complete any such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable terms or at all. We have limited institutional knowledge and experience with respect to these business development activities, and we may also not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction or arrangement. In particular, these collaborations may not result in the development of products that achieve commercial success or viable product improvements or result in significant revenues and could be terminated prior to developing any products.\nAdditionally, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the transaction or arrangement, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our future collaborators may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals. It is possible that conflicts may arise with our collaborators, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones, or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations or the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any conflicts arise with any future collaborators, they may act in their self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interest, and they may breach their obligations to us. In addition, we may have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that any future collaborators devote to our or their future products. Disputes between us and our collaborators may result in litigation or arbitration which would increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management. Further, these transactions and arrangements will be contractual in nature and will generally be terminable under the terms of the applicable agreements and, in such event, we may not continue to have rights to the products relating to such transaction or arrangement or may need to purchase such rights at a premium.\nIf we enter into in-bound intellectual property license agreements, we may not be able to fully protect the licensed intellectual property rights or maintain those licenses. Future licensors could retain the right to prosecute and defend the intellectual property rights licensed to us, in which case we would depend on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for the licensed intellectual property. These licensors may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Further, entering into such license agreements could impose various diligence, commercialization, royalty or other obligations on us. Future licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of complementary products or technologies, and the failure to manage acquisitions, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire other companies, products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base, or advance our business strategies. Potential acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nproblems assimilating the acquired products or technologies;\n\u2022\nissues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nincreased legal and accounting costs relating to the acquisitions or compliance with regulatory matters; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated or undisclosed liabilities of any target.\nWe have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition. We do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired products or technologies. Our potential inability to integrate any acquired products or technologies effectively may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nPotential complications from our r-SNM System or future enhancements to our r-SNM System may not be revealed by our clinical experience.\nBased on our experience, complications from use of our r-SNM System may include infection, pain at site, lead migration or fracture, and the body\u2019s rejection of the implant. However, if unanticipated side-effects result from the use of our r-SNM System, we could be subject to liability and our device would not be widely adopted. Long-term use may result in unanticipated complications, even after the device is removed. Additionally, while the INS battery for our r-SNM System is designed to last approximately 15 years, we have not tested the battery in an actual implant in the body for that period and the battery may not last that long under normal or atypical use conditions. If implants in people reveal that our battery fails before its designed 15-year life, physicians and patients may lose confidence in our r-SNM System, which may materially harm our reputation and our business.\nOur ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of our r-SNM therapy.\nCurrently, the gross profit generated from the sale of our r-SNM System is not sufficient to cover our operating expenses. To achieve our operating and strategic goals, we need to, among other things, reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of our r-SNM System. This cannot be achieved without increasing the volume of components that we purchase in order to take advantage of volume-based pricing discounts, improve manufacturing efficiency or increase our volume to leverage manufacturing overhead costs. If we are unable to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing overhead costs per unit, our ability to achieve profitability will be severely constrained. Any increase in manufacturing volumes is dependent upon a corresponding increase in sales. The occurrence of one or more factors that negatively impact the manufacturing or sales of our r-SNM System or reduce our manufacturing efficiency may prevent us from achieving our desired reduction in manufacturing costs, which would negatively affect our operating results and may prevent us from attaining profitability.\nIf we fail to receive access to hospital facilities, our sales may decrease.\nIn the United States, in order for physicians to use our r-SNM System, we expect that the hospital facilities where these physicians treat patients will typically require us to enter into purchasing contracts. This process can be lengthy and time-consuming and require extensive negotiations and management time. In the European Union, or EU, certain institutions may require us to engage in a contract bidding process in the event that such institutions are considering making purchase commitments that exceed specified cost thresholds, which vary by jurisdiction. These processes are only open at certain periods of time, and we may not be successful in the bidding process. If we do not receive access to hospital facilities via these contracting processes or otherwise, or if we are unable to secure contracts or tender successful bids, our sales may decrease and our operating results may be harmed. Furthermore, we may expend significant effort in these time-consuming processes and still may not obtain a purchase contract from such hospitals.\nOur indebtedness to Silicon Valley Bank may limit our flexibility in operating our business and adversely affect our financial health and competitive position, and all of our obligations to Silicon Valley Bank are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property assets. If we default on these obligations, Silicon Valley Bank could foreclose on our assets.\nIn February 2018, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank providing for a term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). In October 2018, we and Silicon Valley Bank entered into an amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (as so amended, the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we have drawn $20.0 million in three tranches of term loans, with such drawn obligations maturing on December 1, 2021.\nThe Loan Agreement provides for monthly interest payments through December 31, 2019. On the first day of the end of the interest only period, we will be required to repay the Term Loan in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest through maturity. Outstanding principal balances under the Term Loan bear interest at the prime rate plus 1.75%.\nWe may prepay amounts outstanding under the Term Loan in increments of $5.0 million at any time with 30 days prior written notice to Silicon Valley Bank. However, all prepayments of the Term Loan prior to maturity, whether voluntary or mandatory (acceleration or otherwise), are also subject to the payment of a prepayment fee equal to (i) for a prepayment made on or after the closing date through and including the first anniversary of the closing date, 3.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loan being prepaid, (ii) for a prepayment made after the date which is the first anniversary of the closing date through and including the second anniversary of the closing date, 2.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loan being prepaid, and (iii) for a prepayment made after the date which is the second anniversary of the closing date and before the maturity date, 1.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loan being prepaid. Additionally, on the earliest to occur of (i) the maturity date of the Term Loan, (ii) the acceleration of the Term Loan, or (iii) the prepayment of the Term Loan, we will be required to make a final payment equal to the original principal amount of such Tranche multiplied by 7.50%. We are currently accruing the portion of the final payment calculated based on the amount outstanding under the Term Loan.\nAll obligations under the Term Loan are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property assets and more than 65% of the shares of voting capital stock of any of our foreign subsidiaries. We have agreed with Silicon Valley Bank not to encumber our intellectual property assets without its prior written consent unless a security interest in the underlying intellectual property is necessary to have a security interest in the accounts and proceeds that are part of the assets securing the Term Loan, in which case our intellectual property shall automatically be included within the assets securing the Term Loan. As a result, if we default on any of our obligations under the Loan Agreement, Silicon Valley Bank could foreclose on its security interest and liquidate some or all of the collateral, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease operations.\nIn order to service this indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future, we need to generate cash from our operating activities. Our ability to generate cash is subject, in part, to our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings or other financings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness and fund our other liquidity needs. To the extent we are required to use cash from operations or the proceeds of any future financing to service our indebtedness instead of funding working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, we will be less able to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, industry and in the economy generally. This could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nThe Loan Agreement contains certain covenants that limit our ability to engage in certain transactions that may be in our long-term best interest. Subject to certain limited exceptions, these covenants limit our ability to or prohibit us to permit any of our subsidiaries to, as applicable, among other things:\n\u2022\npay cash dividends on, make any other distributions in respect of, or redeem, retire or repurchase, any shares of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nconvey, sell, lease, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of all or any part of our business or property;\n\u2022\neffect certain changes in our business, management, ownership or business locations;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with, or acquire all or substantially all of the capital stock or property of any other company;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, or be liable for any additional indebtedness, or create, incur, allow, or permit to exist any additional liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates.\nWhile we have not previously breached and are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in the Loan Agreement, we may breach these covenants in the future. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events and factors beyond our control. In the event that we breach one or more covenants, Silicon Valley Bank may choose to declare an event of default and require that we immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement, terminate any commitment to extend further credit and foreclose on the collateral. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our r-SNM System and manage our inventory.\nIf our r-SNM System is approved in the United States, to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with suppliers based on our estimates of future demand for our r-SNM System. If approved in the United States, we anticipate there will be an increased demand for our r-SNM System, and our limited historical experience in foreign markets may not provide us with enough data to accurately predict future demand. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our r-SNM System could be negatively affected by many factors, including our failure to adequately manage our expansion efforts, product introductions by competitors, an increase or decrease in customer demand for our r-SNM System or for products of our competitors, our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new product enhancements, unanticipated changes in general market conditions or regulatory matters, and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs, which would cause our gross margin to be adversely affected and could impair the strength of our brand. Similarly, a portion of our inventory could become obsolete or expire, which could have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace obsolete inventory. Any of these occurrences could negatively impact our financial performance.\nConversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our r-SNM System, we may not be able to deliver sufficient products to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, which could result in damage to our reputation and customer relationships. In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand, additional supplies of raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or our third-party manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient resources to meet our increased requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our r-SNM System and our results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties for the manufacture of our r-SNM System. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our r-SNM System or such quantities at an acceptable cost, and reduces our control over the manufacturing process, which could delay, prevent, or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of certain components of our r-SNM System. For our off-the-shelf components, we do not have long-term supply agreements with many of our third-party manufacturers, and we purchase certain components of our r-SNM System on a purchase order basis. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe possible failure of the third party to manufacture any such component of our r-SNM System according to our schedule, or at all, including if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our r-SNM System or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements and/or purchase orders between us and them;\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nsupplier demands for significant cost increases;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach by the third-party manufacturers of our agreements with them;\n\u2022\nthe failure of third-party manufacture to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe possible failure of the third-party to manufacture such component of our r-SNM System according to our specifications; and\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations applicable to our r-SNM System. Third-party manufacturers may not be able, or fail, to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. If our third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, we do not have complete control over the ability of our third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority withdraws any such approval they have already procured, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market our r-SNM System. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely harm our business and results of operations.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of certain components of our r-SNM System. If our current third-party manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace those manufacturers. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture these components, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our r-SNM System may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize our r-SNM System on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe have a limited history of manufacturing and assembling our r-SNM System in commercial quantities and may encounter related problems or delays that could result in lost revenue.\nThe manufacturing process of our r-SNM System includes sourcing components from various third-party suppliers, assembly and testing. We must manufacture and assemble these systems in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We have only a limited history of manufacturing and assembling our r-SNM System and, as a result, we may have difficulty manufacturing and assembling this system in sufficient quantities in a timely manner. To manage our manufacturing and operations with our suppliers, we will need to forecast anticipated product orders and material requirements to predict our inventory needs from six months to a year in advance and enter into purchase orders on the basis of these requirements. Our limited manufacturing history may not provide us with enough data to accurately predict future component demand, fluctuations in availability and pricing of commodity materials of supply, and, to anticipate our costs and supply needs effectively. We may in the future experience delays in obtaining components from suppliers, which could impede our ability to manufacture and assemble our r-SNM System on our expected timeline. As a result of this or any other delays, we may encounter difficulties in production of our r-SNM System, including problems with quality control and assurance, component supply shortages or surpluses (including with respect to the ceramic and titanium we use in our r-SNM System), increased costs, shortages of qualified personnel and difficulties associated with compliance with local, state, federal and foreign regulatory requirements.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by shipping carriers could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation and ability to provide our r-SNM System on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping will be essential to our operations. We intend to rely heavily on providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of our r-SNM System to our customers and for tracking of these shipments. Should a carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of our r-SNM System, it would be costly to replace our r-SNM System in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our r-SNM System and increased cost and expense to our business.\nIn addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions affecting delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to process orders for our r-SNM System on a timely basis.\nOur employees, consultants, and other commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, consultants, and other commercial partners and business associates may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators, manufacturing standards, healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and internationally or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry, including the sale of medical devices, are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees, consultants and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees and reputational harm, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry or group purchasing organizations could lead to demands for price concessions, which may affect our ability to sell our r-SNM System at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, which has resulted in or led to numerous cost reform initiatives by legislators, regulators and third-party payors. Cost reform has triggered a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power, which may create more requests for price concessions in the future. Additionally, group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts may continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the healthcare industry worldwide, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our future customers, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our r-SNM System.\nTo successfully market and sell our r-SNM System in markets outside of the United States, we must address many international business risks with which we have limited experience, and failure to manage these risks may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe currently have a limited sales and marketing organization outside the United States. We expect to have sales and operations both inside and outside the United States. Our strategy is to increase our international presence in Europe, Canada, and Australia that have established and favorable reimbursement. International sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our international sales, marketing, and other operations;\n\u2022\nincreased competition as a result of more products and procedures receiving regulatory approval or otherwise being free to market in internationally;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nexport restrictions, trade regulations, and foreign tax laws;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nforeign certification and regulatory clearance or approval requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing effective marketing campaigns in unfamiliar foreign countries;\n\u2022\ncustoms clearance and shipping delays;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability internationally, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general;\n\u2022\npreference for locally manufactured products;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value-added tax, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and\n\u2022\nFCPA, OFAC, the Bribery Act, each of which is defined below, and other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations.\nIf one or more of these risks are realized, our ability to expand our operations into international markets could be limited, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position will depend on our ability to retain senior management and other highly qualified personnel.\nOur success will depend in part on our continued ability to retain and motivate our highly qualified management, clinical, and other personnel. We are highly dependent upon our management team, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and member of our board of directors, Raymond W. Cohen, and the other members of our senior management, and other key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. The replacement of any of our key personnel would likely involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we do not carry any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances.\nMany of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a meaningful amount of our common stock or common stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or have the option to purchase have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase price for the shares, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock, particularly after the expiration of the lock-up agreements entered into in connection with our IPO. Replacement of any employees who leave our company could involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage or reimbursement for our r-SNM System, our commercial success may be severely hindered, and in the event insurers require a prior authorization process, such process may not result in positive coverage determination for these patients.\nIn the United States, we expect to derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of our r-SNM System to hospitals and ASCs, which typically bill various third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations. In addition, we expect that any portion of the costs and fees associated with our r-SNM System that are not covered by these third-party payors, such as deductibles or co-payments, will be billed directly to the patient by the provider. Further, certain third-party payors may not cover our r-SNM System and the related procedures because they may determine that our r-SNM System and the related procedures are experimental or investigational. Customers that perform the procedure may be subject to reimbursement claim denials upon submission of the claim. Customers may also be subject to recovery of overpayments if a third-party payor makes payment for the claim and subsequently determines that the third-party\npayor\u2019s coding, billing or coverage policies were not followed. In addition, although most large insurers have established coverage policies in place to cover SNM therapy, certain commercial payors have a patient-by-patient prior authorization process that must be followed before they will provide reimbursement for SNM therapy. These processes typically involve the treating physician submitting a form to the payor that provides information about the past treatments provided to the patient that proved ineffective, and the physician\u2019s recommendation that the patient be treated with SNM therapy. Although the prior authorization process can take several weeks, based on our industry knowledge, it generally results in positive coverage determination for these patients, however this process may not result in positive coverage determination for these patients. Further, any decline in the amount payors are willing to reimburse our target customers could make it difficult for our target customers to adopt or continue using our r-SNM System and could create additional pricing pressure for us. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our r-SNM System, our gross margins will decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to grow our business.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our r-SNM System can differ significantly from payor to payor. Payors continually review new and existing technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny or reverse coverage for new or existing products and procedures. Third-party payor policies may not provide coverage for procedures in which our r-SNM System is used.\nOutside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country and by region, particularly based on whether the country or region at issue maintains a single-payor system. SNM therapy is eligible for reimbursement in Canada, Australia, and certain countries in the EU, such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Annual healthcare budgets generally determine the number of SNM systems that will be paid for by the payor in these single-payor system countries and regions. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries or regions may require us to gather additional clinical data before granting coverage and reimbursement for our r-SNM System. We intend to work with payors to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval in countries and regions where it makes economic sense to do so, however, we may not obtain such coverage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to grow our business internationally.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our reputation and business. We may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. This risk exists even if a device is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our r-SNM System is designed to affect, and any future enhancements to our r-SNM System will be designed to affect, important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our r-SNM System could result in patient injury or death. The medical technology industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we may face product liability suits. We may be subject to product liability claims if our r-SNM System causes, or merely appears to have caused, patient injury or death. In addition, an injury that is caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and raw materials, may be the basis for a claim against us. Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our r-SNM System, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ncosts of litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our r-SNM System and develop enhancements to our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\ndamage to our business reputation;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or withdrawals from the market;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or\n\u2022\nloss of sales.\nWhile we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our r-SNM System may delay the supply to our customers and may impact our reputation. We may not be successful in initiating appropriate market recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future and these efforts may not have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Such recalls and withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our r-SNM System, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we have product liability and clinical study liability insurance that we believe is appropriate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. Our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we could be exposed to significant liabilities. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe bear the risk of warranty claims on our r-SNM System.\nWe bear the risk of warranty claims on our r-SNM System. We may not be successful in claiming recovery under any warranty or indemnity provided to us by our suppliers or third-party manufacturers in the event of a successful warranty claim against us by a customer or and any recovery from any such supplier or third-party manufacturer could be inadequate. In addition, warranty claims brought by our customers related to third-party components may arise after our ability to bring corresponding warranty claims against such suppliers or third-party manufacturers expires, which could result in costs to us.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or result\nof operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. The global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our r-SNM System, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely affect our business.\nFailure of a key information technology system, process, or site could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct our business. These systems affect, among other things, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, data security, and other processes necessary to manage our business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may experience interruptions in our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, any breach in our information technology systems could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information, including information from our patient registry or other patient information, which is protected by HIPAA, as defined below, and other laws. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and damage to our reputation.\nIf our facilities are damaged or become inoperable, we will be unable to continue to research and develop our r-SNM System and, as a result, there will be an adverse effect on our business until we are able to secure a new facility and rebuild our inventory.\nWe perform substantially all of our research and development and back office activity and maintain a substantial portion of our finished goods inventory in a single location in Irvine, California. We warehouse a substantially lesser quantity of finished goods in a contract warehousing facility in the Netherlands. Our facilities, equipment and inventory would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Our facilities, and those of our contractors, may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, flooding, fire and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development and commercialization activities for some period of time. The inability to perform those activities, combined with the time it may take to rebuild our inventory of finished product, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIf our international sales increase, we may enter into a greater number of transactions denominated in non-U.S. dollars, which could expose us to foreign currency risks, including changes in currency exchange rates. We do not currently engage in any hedging transactions. If we are unable to address these risks and challenges effectively, our international operations may not be successful and our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs we grow our international presence and global operations, we will be increasingly exposed to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States, EU, and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. In addition, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that \u201cfails to prevent bribery\u201d by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented \u201cadequate procedures\u201d to prevent bribery. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are in the process of implementing policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by us and our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and agents with the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act and other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations. Our policies and procedures may not be sufficient to ensure that our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible, or that our business partners have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations to us or even result in our being held liable for such conduct. Violations of the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act or other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, and its research and development credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, our ability to deduct net interest expense may be limited if we have insufficient taxable income for the year during which the interest is incurred, and any carryovers of such disallowed interest would be subject to the limitation rules similar to those applicable to NOLs and other attributes. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which might be beyond our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. For these reasons, in the event we experience a change of control, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs, research and development credit carryforwards or disallowed interest expense carryovers, even if we attain profitability.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us or our stockholders.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, was signed into law, significantly reforming the Code. The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits. We continue to examine the impact the TCJA may have on our business. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the TCJA on our projection of minimal cash taxes or to our net operating losses. The estimated impact of the TCJA is based on our management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results and our further analysis of the new law. The impact of the TCJA on holders of our common stock remains uncertain and could be adverse. There remains significant uncertainty as to the impact of the TCJA on us and on any investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur r-SNM System and operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and internationally, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business.\nWe and our r-SNM System are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation in the United States, the EU, Canada and other countries, including by the FDA and its foreign counterparts. With respect to medical devices, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies regulate, among other things, design, development and manufacturing, testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage, clinical studies, product safety, establishment registration and device listing, marketing, sales and distribution, pre-market clearance and approval, record keeping procedures, advertising and promotion, recalls and field safety corrective actions, post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury, post-market approval studies, and product import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. Our failure to comply with all applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our r-SNM System and result in enforcement actions such as warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, termination of distribution, recalls or seizures of products, delays in the introduction of products into the market, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of approvals, prohibitions on sales of our r-SNM System, and in the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nIn the event our r-SNM System receives regulatory approval in the United States, we will remain subject to the periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspection of our facilities, review of production processes, and testing of our r-SNM System to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. Adverse findings during regulatory\ninspections may result in costly remediation efforts, requirements that we complete government mandated clinical studies or government enforcement actions.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our r-SNM System or expanded indications, the commercial prospects for our r-SNM System may be harmed and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nWe may not receive the necessary clearances or approvals for our r-SNM System or expanded indications, and failure to timely obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our r-SNM System or expanded indications would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nAs an active-implantable device, our r-SNM System is subject to the most stringent degree of medical device regulation. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. In the process of obtaining PMA approval, which is required for our r-SNM System, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based in part on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. In addition, if we were to pursue regulatory approvals for additional indications for our r-SNM System, we would be required to conduct additional clinical studies or pre-clinical studies to support such indications, which would be time-consuming and expensive, and may produce results that do not support such regulatory approvals.\nModifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical studies. Despite the time, effort and cost, a device may not be approved or cleared by the FDA. Typically, the PMA review process can take from six to 18 months, with the duration depending on a variety of factors.\nIn 2016, our r-SNM System received regulatory approval in Europe and Canada, and in 2018 in Australia, for the treatment of OAB, FI, and UR. We have not obtained regulatory approval of our r-SNM System in the United States. In 2017, the FDA granted us an IDE allowing us to conduct a pivotal study designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM System for the treatment of UUI in order to obtain FDA approval in the United States through the PMA pathway. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our r-SNM System could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated use for our r-SNM System, which may limit the market for the device.\nIf our r-SNM System is approved in the United States through the PMA pathway, any modification to or additional indications for our r-SNM System that were not previously approved may require us to submit an additional PMA or PMA supplement and obtain FDA approval prior to implementing the change. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination, make modifications to the device, generate additional data to submit to the FDA or additional indications for approved products than we had expected, product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable regulatory entity or notified body that our r-SNM System is safe or effective for its intended uses;\n\u2022\nthe disagreement of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design or implementation of our clinical studies or the interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical studies;\n\u2022\nserious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical studies may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks;\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval.\nFor example, as part of the IDE approval process for our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study, the FDA recommended that we should make several modifications to the study design in order for the study to serve as the primary clinical support for a future marketing approval. Specifically, despite our responses and supporting documentation that we submitted in support of our study design, the FDA reiterated its previously expressed recommendations that we make the following modifications to our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study:\n\u2022\nexclude patients with MUI;\n\u2022\nuse either a seven-day bladder diary or two separate three-day bladder diaries;\n\u2022\nuse a 12-month primary effectiveness endpoint in order to account for the placebo effect and enable assessment of durability of the treatment effect;\n\u2022\nuse all patients in whom an implant is attempted, not initial responders after one month, for primary efficacy analysis;\n\u2022\nuse multiple imputation to account for missing primary endpoint data;\n\u2022\nrevise the protocol to include details on statistical analysis methods for analyzing the primary and secondary endpoints, analysis population, method for handling missing endpoint data and sensitivities and poolability analyses;\n\u2022\nuse a two-sided 95% confidence interval; and\n\u2022\nprovide further justification for restarting with a new activation date after a lead issue.\nIn response, we engaged with the FDA regarding its recommendation, including our latest IDE supplement, which we submitted to the FDA in September 2018 to address certain of its recommendations. As a result, we incorporated a number of recommended study modifications. However, to date we elected not to incorporate several of the recommended modifications based on what we believe are currently accepted urology practice guidelines and the design of previous OAB clinical studies accepted by the FDA. We believe certain of these modifications would have resulted in a study design that increased study site and patient burdens, decreased the feasibility of enrollment or were not clearly supported by available peer-reviewed literature or currently accepted urology practice guidelines. At this point in the study, some of the FDA\u2019s recommendations cannot be implemented. For example, we cannot exclude patients with MUI and we cannot change the three-day bladder diaries taken at baseline to seven-day bladder diaries. On October 19, 2018, the FDA approved our latest IDE supplement and removed certain of its prior study design recommendations while reiterating several others. On November 9, 2018, we filed an additional IDE supplement with the FDA regarding certain of its reiterated recommendations, and the response from the FDA is pending.\nWe completed enrollment of patients for the ARTISAN-SNM study in June of 2018. The approved protocol from the FDA based on our September 2018 IDE supplement incorporated certain of the FDA\u2019s recommended study design considerations. Although we have not modified the ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study design to address all of the considerations that the FDA has reiterated, based on the study results to date, we believe we will be able to satisfy the FDA with reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM system to support its marketing approval. However, it is possible that the FDA may not consider the results to be sufficiently strong or that, in part due to its concerns with our study design, the FDA will not accept the data as a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain marketing approval of our r-SNM System. If we intend to modify the study design to address any of the above FDA considerations that we have not already addressed, we will be required to obtain FDA approval of an IDE supplement before implementing the changes, which could result in significant delays. The approval requirements for an IDE supplement are generally the same as an original IDE, and they are approved if the FDA does not object within 30 days. We would also be required to get IRB approval of the protocol changes if the changes involve the rights, safety, or welfare of the patients, and some investigators may determine that local rules require additional approvals from a local IRB.\nIn addition, incorporating modifications may be costly or not possible at this point in the ongoing clinical study or lead to delays in obtaining approval from the FDA, which may be significant and adversely and materially\naffect our ability to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System. Further, even if we make changes to the study design to address these considerations, the FDA may not approve our r-SNM System.\nWe initially submitted a literature-based PMA on January 9, 2018, in which we claimed equivalence to InterStim II based on the review of technical specifications, published clinical studies, and other information. On May 9, 2018, the FDA responded to our initial literature-based PMA and requested that we submit additional information to demonstrate that our r-SNM System is sufficiently similar to InterStim II, as well as asking us to address a number of other matters. On October 18, 2018, we responded to the FDA and withdrew our initial literature-based PMA. On December 3, 2018, we submitted a new literature-based PMA claiming equivalence to InterStim II. This literature-based PMA was based on reasonable safety and effectiveness data from a literature review. In this PMA filing, we submitted existing literature reporting on InterStim II. In addition to the technical specifications, testing data and published literature, we included one-year follow-up data from our 51-patient RELAX-OAB European post-market clinical follow-up study to support the PMA, and subsequently provided the FDA with the clinical results on the first 60 patients to reach their six-month primary endpoint from our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study. This PMA filing incorporates all elements of the r-SNM System, the External Trial System, and related accessories, as well as the additional information addressing FDA\u2019s questions in its May 9, 2018 correspondence. Since the PMA submission on December 3, 2018, we have submitted various amendments to the PMA. These amendments include data in support of conditional full-body MRI labeling, and complete three-month and six-month clinical data from the ARTISAN-SNM study.\nIn addition to this, on March 1, 2019, we submitted a new literature-based PMA seeking approval for FI. This PMA is also based on an existing literature review of Interstim II.\nThe FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval of our r-SNM System or impact our ability to modify or seek additional indications for our r-SNM System on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain approvals, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain approvals once obtained. For example, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, and the FDA Reauthorization Act, enacted in 2017, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \u201cMedical Device Regulatory Improvements\u201d and miscellaneous reforms, which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-clearance and approval. Some of these proposals and reforms could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain approvals, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain approvals once obtained.\nIn order to sell our r-SNM System in member countries of the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), it must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 90/385/EEC), or the AIMD Directive. If any future product candidates are also considered to qualify as an active implantable medical device, or AIMD, under the AIMD Directive, it too will need to comply with the essential requirements it sets out. Alternatively, if a future product candidate is not considered an AIMD under the AIMD Directive, it will still be required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). The Medical Devices Regulations (Regulation 2017/745) are also now in force, as further discussed below.\nCompliance with the requirements under either of these Directives and confirmation by a Notifiable Body that this is the case is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene, or CE, mark to our r-SNM System and any future product candidates. Without a CE mark, medical devices cannot be sold or marketed in the EEA. To demonstrate that our r-SNM System is compliant with the essential requirements set out under the AIMD Directive, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. This requires an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed to ensure and declare that the products in question comply with the standards set out in Annex I of the AIMD Directive. In addition, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are separate entities that are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by the governmental authorities of each EU Member State. Manufacturers of AIMDs must make an application to a Notified Body for an assessment of its technical dossiers and quality system. Alternatively, manufacturers can seek approval from the Notified Body that a representative sample of the products it has manufactured satisfies the requirements set out in the AIMD Directive and subsequently ensure and declare that all of its products conform to the standard of the approved sample. This is also known as \u201ctype approval.\u201d\nFuture product candidates that are not considered AIMDs under the AIMD Directive will still require a conformity assessment procedure. The types of procedures required are set out in the Medical Devices Directive and will vary according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices) the manufacturer can issue a Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive. However, for all other types of medical devices a similar conformity assessment procedure to that outlined above and in the AIMD Directive will be required, also involving the intervention of a Notified Body.\nFor our r-SNM System, future AIMD product candidates and all other future product candidates, the Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.\nAs a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. If we fail to remain in compliance with the applicable Directives outlined above, we would be unable to continue to affix the CE mark to our r-SNM System or our external trial system, which would prevent us from selling it within the EEA.\nModifications to our r-SNM System may require us to obtain new PMA approvals or approvals of a PMA supplement, and if we market modified products without obtaining necessary approvals, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified products until required approvals are obtained.\nCertain modifications to a PMA-approved device may require approval of a new PMA or a PMA supplement, or alternatively a notification or other submission to FDA. We will be responsible for deciding whether a modification requires approval by the FDA. However, the FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether a new PMA or PMA supplement is necessary. We may make modifications to our r-SNM System that we believe do not require approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit a new PMA or PMA supplement for modifications to previously approved products, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our r-SNM System, if approved by the FDA, may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about approved medical devices, such as our r-SNM System, if approved by the FDA. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or other similar regulatory authorities as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive approval for our r-SNM System in the United States for the treatment of OAB and UR, or FI, physicians could use our r-SNM System on their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, including the treatment of other indications. If approved, we will train our marketing personnel and sales representatives to not promote our r-SNM System for uses outside of FDA-approved indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our r-SNM System off-label when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our r-SNM System off-label. Furthermore, the use of our r-SNM System for indications other than those that may be approved by the FDA or approved by any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients. In addition, physicians have experience using the Medtronic system, which is approved for several indications, including UUI, UUF, FI, and UR. If physicians adopt our r-SNM System, for which we have not pursued regulatory approval in the United States for indications other than for the treatment of OAB, UR, and FI, physicians could use our r-SNM System off-label for additional unapproved indications based in part on their familiarity with the Medtronic system.\nIf the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of a warning letter, an untitled letter, which is used for violators that do not necessitate a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages (including treble damages), fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.\nIn addition, physicians may misuse our r-SNM System or use improper techniques, potentially leading to adverse results, side effects or injury, which may lead to an increased risk of product liability claims. If our r-SNM System is approved, and subsequently misused or used with improper techniques or is determined to cause or contribute to patient harm, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or patients. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from the commercialization of our r-SNM System, be expensive to defend, result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance, and subject us to negative publicity resulting in reduced sales of our r-SNM System.\nThe clinical study process required to obtain regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive with uncertain outcomes. If clinical studies of our r-SNM System do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the United States or elsewhere, we will be unable to gain regulatory approval for, expand the indications for or commercialize our r-SNM System and may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the commercialization of our r-SNM System.\nTo date, we have not obtained PMA approval for our r-SNM System. In order to obtain PMA approval for a device, the sponsor must meet the regulatory submission requirements of the FDA, which in many cases may require a PMA applicant to conduct well-controlled clinical studies designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product. Conducting clinical studies is a complex and expensive process, can take many years, and outcomes are inherently uncertain. We incur substantial expense for, and devote significant time to, clinical studies but cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in commercial revenue. We may experience significant setbacks in clinical studies, even after earlier clinical studies showed promising results, and failure can occur at any time during the clinical study process. Any of our products, including our r-SNM System, could malfunction or produce undesirable adverse effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies. We, the FDA, or another regulatory\nauthority may suspend or terminate clinical studies at any time to avoid exposing trial participants to unacceptable health risks.\nWe completed enrollment of patients for the ARTISAN-SNM study in June of 2018. The approved protocol from the FDA based on our September 2018 IDE supplement incorporated certain of the FDA\u2019s recommended study design considerations. Although we have not modified the ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study design to address all of the considerations that the FDA has reiterated, based on the study results to date, we believe we will be able to satisfy the FDA with reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM system to support its marketing approval. However, it is possible that the FDA may not consider the results to be sufficiently strong or that, in part due to its concerns with our study design, the FDA will not accept the data as a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain marketing approval of our r-SNM System. If we intend to modify the study design to address any of the above FDA considerations that we have not already addressed, we will be required to obtain FDA approval of an IDE supplement before implementing the changes, which could result in significant delays. The approval requirements for an IDE supplement are generally the same as an original IDE, and they are approved if the FDA does not object within 30 days. We would also be required to get IRB approval of the protocol changes if the changes involve the rights, safety, or welfare of the patients, and some investigators may determine that local rules require additional approvals from a local IRB.\nIn addition, incorporating modifications may be costly or not possible at this point in the ongoing clinical study or lead to delays in obtaining approval from the FDA, which may be significant and adversely and materially affect our ability to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System. Further, even if we make changes to the study design to address these considerations, the FDA may not approve our r-SNM System.\nWe initially submitted a literature-based PMA on January 9, 2018, in which we claimed equivalence to InterStim II based on the review of technical specifications, published clinical studies, and other information. On May 9, 2018, the FDA responded to our initial literature-based PMA and requested that we submit additional information to demonstrate that our r-SNM System is sufficiently similar to InterStim II, as well as asking us to address a number of other matters. On October 18, 2018, we responded to the FDA and withdrew our initial literature-based PMA. On December 3, 2018, we submitted a new literature-based PMA claiming equivalence to InterStim II. This literature-based PMA was based on reasonable safety and effectiveness data from a literature review. In this PMA filing, we submitted existing literature reporting on InterStim II. In addition to the technical specifications, testing data and published literature, we included one-year follow-up data from our 51-patient RELAX-OAB European post-market clinical follow-up study to support the PMA, and subsequently provided the FDA with the clinical results on the first 60 patients to reach their six-month primary endpoint from our ARTISAN-SNM pivotal study. This PMA filing incorporates all elements of the r-SNM System, the External Trial System, and related accessories, as well as the additional information addressing FDA\u2019s questions in its May 9, 2018 correspondence. Since the PMA submission on December 3, 2018, we have submitted various amendments to the PMA. These amendments include data in support of conditional full-body MRI labeling, and complete three-month and six-month clinical data from the ARTISAN-SNM study.\nIn addition to this, on March 1, 2019, we submitted a new literature-based PMA seeking approval for FI. This PMA is also based on an existing literature review of Interstim II.\nSuccessful results of pre-clinical studies are not necessarily indicative of future clinical study results, and predecessor clinical study results may not be replicated in subsequent clinical studies. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, or may find the clinical study design, conduct or results inadequate to prove safety or efficacy, and may require us to pursue additional pre-clinical studies or clinical studies, which could further delay the clearance or approval of our r-SNM System. The data we collect from our pre-clinical studies and clinical studies may not be sufficient to support FDA clearance or approval, and if we are unable to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM System in our clinical studies, we will be unable to obtain regulatory clearance or approval to market our r-SNM System.\nIn addition, we may estimate and publicly announce the anticipated timing of the accomplishment of various clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which are often referred to as milestones. These milestones could include obtaining the right to affix the CE mark to certain products in the EU, submitting an IDE to the FDA, applying to commence a pivotal clinical study for a new product, enrolling patients in clinical studies, releasing data from clinical studies, and other clinical and regulatory events. The actual timing of these milestones could vary\ndramatically compared to our estimates and public announcements, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. We may not meet our projected milestones and if we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our r-SNM System may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nClinical studies are necessary to support PMA applications and may be necessary to support PMA supplements for modified versions of, or additional indications for, our r-SNM System. This would require the enrollment of large numbers of suitable subjects, which may be difficult to identify, recruit and maintain as participants in the clinical trial. Adverse outcomes in the post-approval studies could also result in restrictions or withdrawal of approval of a PMA. We will likely need to conduct additional clinical studies in the future to support new indications for our r-SNM System or for approvals or clearances, or for the approval of the use of our r-SNM System in some foreign countries. Clinical testing is difficult to design and implement, can take many years, can be expensive, and, testing carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons. We may experience a number of events that could adversely affect the costs, timing or successful completion of our clinical studies, including:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to submit an IDE application to FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical studies, and the FDA may reject our IDE application and notify us that we may not begin investigational trials;\n\u2022\nregulators and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree as to the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nregulators and/or IRBs, or other reviewing bodies may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, or to conduct or continue a clinical study at a prospective or specific trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may not reach agreements with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nclinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of subjects or patients required for clinical studies may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical studies may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate, and the number of clinical studies being conducted at any given time may be high and result in fewer available patients for any given clinical trial, or patients may drop out of these clinical studies at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party manufacturers, including those conducting clinical studies on our behalf, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical studies for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nwe may have to amend clinical study protocols or conduct additional studies to reflect changes in regulatory requirements or guidance, which we may be required to submit to an IRB and/or regulatory authorities for re-examination;\n\u2022\nregulators or other parties may require or recommend that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety signals or noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical studies may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nclinical sites may not adhere to the clinical protocol or may drop out of a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to recruit a sufficient number of clinical study sites;\n\u2022\nregulators, IRBs, or other reviewing bodies may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers or suppliers of materials for our clinical studies, the materials necessary to conduct clinical studies may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply;\n\u2022\napproval policies or regulations of FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies may change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; and\n\u2022\nour r-SNM System may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics.\nPatient enrollment in clinical studies and completion of patient follow-up depend on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, patient compliance, competing clinical studies and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical studies if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of a product, or they may be persuaded to participate in contemporaneous clinical studies of a competitor\u2019s product. In addition, patients participating in our clinical studies may drop out before completion of the trial or experience adverse medical events unrelated to our r-SNM System. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical study may delay commencement or completion of the clinical trial, cause an increase in the costs of the clinical trial, or result in the failure of the clinical trial.\nClinical studies must be conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities\u2019 legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, and are subject to oversight by these governmental agencies and IRBs at the medical institutions where the clinical studies are conducted. In addition, clinical studies must be conducted with supplies of our product produced under cGMP requirements and other regulations. Furthermore, we rely on clinical study sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical studies and we have limited influence over their performance. We depend on our collaborators and on medical institutions and employees to conduct our clinical studies in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements. If our collaborators fail to enroll participants for our clinical studies, fail to conduct the study to GCP standards or are delayed for a significant time in the execution of trials, including achieving full enrollment, we may be affected by increased costs, program delays or both. In addition, clinical studies that are conducted in countries outside the United States may result in additional delays and expenses due to increased shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of non-U.S. resources, and may expose us to risks associated with clinical investigators who are unknown to the FDA, and different standards of diagnosis, screening and medical care.\nFailure can occur at any stage of clinical testing. Our clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our r-SNM System or any product we may develop in the future would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance or approval and, ultimately, the commercialization of the product or indication for use. Even if our r-SNM System is cleared or approved in the United States, commercialization of our r-SNM System in foreign countries requires approval by regulatory authorities in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical studies. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our r-SNM System is approved by the FDA, failure to comply with post-marketing regulatory requirements could subject us to enforcement actions, including substantial penalties, and might require us to recall or withdraw our r-SNM System from the market.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for our r-SNM System, we will be subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the manufacture, marketing, advertising, medical device reporting, sale, promotion, registration, and listing of our r-SNM System. For example, if our r-SNM System is approved, we will be required to submit periodic reports to the FDA as a condition of PMA approval. These reports include safety and effectiveness information about the device after its approval. Failure to submit such reports, or failure to submit the reports in a timely manner, could result in enforcement action by the FDA. Following its review of the periodic reports, the FDA might ask for additional information or initiate further investigation.\nIn addition, in order to obtain PMA approval for our r-SNM System, we may be to subject to several conditions of approval, including a post-market long-term study and extended follow-up of the pre-market study cohort. Any\nfailure to comply with the conditions of approval could result in the failure to obtain PMA approval or delay or withdrawal of PMA approval and the inability to market the device. Failure to conduct the required studies in accordance with IRB and informed consent requirements, or adverse findings in these studies, could also be grounds for failure to obtain PMA approval or delay or withdrawal of PMA approval.\nRegulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to continue or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs, or lower than anticipated sales. Even if we obtain the proper regulatory approval to market our r-SNM System, we will have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations and applicable foreign laws and regulations. The FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters or warning letters;\n\u2022\nfines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecalls, termination of distribution, administrative detention, or seizure of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\ndelays in or refusal to grant our request for PMA approval of our r-SNM System and any future PMA approvals or foreign regulatory approvals of future product candidates, new intended uses, or modifications to our existing product;\n\u2022\nwithdrawals or suspensions of PMAs or foreign regulatory approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nFDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur r-SNM System must be manufactured in accordance with federal and state regulations, and we or any of our suppliers or third-party manufacturers could be forced to recall our r-SNM System or terminate production if we fail to comply with these regulations.\nThe methods used in, and the facilities used for, the manufacture of our r-SNM System must comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, handling, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and shipping of medical devices. Furthermore, we are required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality standards and applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of subcontractors. Our r-SNM System will also be subject to similar state regulations and various laws and regulations of foreign countries governing manufacturing.\nOur third-party manufacturers may not take the necessary steps to comply with applicable regulations, which could cause delays in the delivery of our r-SNM System, if approved. In addition, failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements or later discovery of previously unknown problems with the manufacturing processes for our r-SNM System could result in, among other things: warning letters or untitled letters, fines, injunctions or civil penalties, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of our r-SNM System, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending or future clearances or approvals for our product, clinical holds, refusal to permit the import or export of our r-SNM System, and criminal prosecution of us or our employees. Any of these actions could significantly and negatively affect supply of our r-SNM System. If any of these events occurs, our reputation could be harmed, we could be exposed to product liability claims and we could lose customers and experience reduced sales and increased costs.\nIf our r-SNM System is approved by the FDA and treatment guidelines for the indications for which it is approved later change or the standard of care evolves, we may need to redesign and seek a new marketing authorization from the FDA for our r-SNM System.\nIf our r-SNM System is approved by the FDA and treatment guidelines for the indications for which it is approved change or the standard of care evolves, we may need to redesign our r-SNM System, or any future product, and seek new approvals from the FDA. PMA approvals from the FDA are based on current treatment guidelines at the time of the approvals. If treatment guidelines change so that different treatments become desirable, the clinical utility of our r-SNM System could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf approved, our r-SNM System may cause or contribute to adverse medical events or be subject to failures or malfunctions that we are required to report to the FDA, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. The discovery of serious safety issues with our r-SNM System, or a recall of our r-SNM System, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us.\nIf our r-SNM System is approved by the FDA, we will be subject to the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations and similar foreign regulations, which will require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that our r-SNM System may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of device approvals, seizure of our r-SNM System or delay in clearance or approval of modifications to our r-SNM System.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that our r-SNM System could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall our r-SNM System if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. Defects or other errors in our r-SNM System may occur in the future. Depending on the corrective action we take to redress deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals for our r-SNM System before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our r-SNM System, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties or civil or criminal fines.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our r-SNM System in the future that we may determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us and negatively affect our sales. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by our r-SNM System after obtaining regulatory approval in the United States or other jurisdictions, a number of potentially negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require a recall of the product or we may voluntarily recall a product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of warnings or contraindications in the product labeling, narrowing of the indication in the product label or issuance of field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require us to create a guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to limitations as to how we promote the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or modify the product in some other way;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional clinical studies or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product;\n\u2022\nsales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour brand and reputation may suffer.\nAny of the above events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our r-SNM System and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our r-SNM System. The demand for our r-SNM System could also be negatively impacted by any adverse effects of a competitor\u2019s product or treatment.\nIf we do not obtain and maintain international regulatory registrations or approvals for our r-SNM System, we will be unable to market and sell our r-SNM System outside of the United States.\nWe currently have marketing approvals in Europe, Canada, and Australia for OAB, FI, and UR. We may in the future seek marketing approvals in additional countries but do not have current plans to do so. Sales of our r-SNM System outside of the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the United States. While the regulations of some countries may not impose barriers to marketing and selling our r-SNM System, or only require notification, others require that we obtain the approval of a specified regulatory body. Complying with foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining additional registrations or approvals, can be expensive and time-consuming, and we may not receive regulatory approvals in each country in which we plan to market our r-SNM System or we may be unable to do so on a timely basis. The time required to obtain registrations or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA approval, and requirements for such registrations, clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. If we modify our r-SNM System, we may need to apply for additional regulatory approvals before we are permitted to sell the modified product. In addition, we may not continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the authorizations that we have received. If we are unable to maintain our authorizations in a particular country, we will no longer be able to sell the applicable product in that country.\nRegulatory approval by the FDA does not ensure registration, clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and registration, clearance or approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure registration, clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining registration or regulatory clearance or approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms in the United States or Europe may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our r-SNM System, or to manufacture, market or distribute our r-SNM System after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our r-SNM System. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of or make it more difficult to obtain approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our r-SNM System. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require: additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval for future product candidates, changes to\nmanufacturing methods, recall, replacement or discontinuance of future product candidates, or additional record keeping.\nOn April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. The Medical Devices Regulations would be directly applicable and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member states. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.\nThe Medical Devices Regulation will only become applicable after the three-year transition period ends on May 26, 2020. Up until this date, conformity certificates can continue to be issued validly by Notifiable Bodies under the AIMD and Medical Devices Directives. Alternatively, during the three-year transition period, manufacturers can choose to conform with and have their products certified under the Medical Devices Regulations. Certificates of compliance issued pursuant to these Directives prior to May 26, 2020 will continue to be valid for up to a period of four years. However, after May 26, 2020, new products placed on the market may only be certified under the Medical Device Regulations regime. Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:\n\u2022\nstrengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u2022\nestablish explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u2022\nimprove the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u2022\nset up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and\n\u2022\nstrengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nThese modifications may have an effect on the way we conduct our business in the EEA.\nIn addition, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, or Brexit, will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of an agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provided its notice of withdrawal. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, the referendum could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to products approved and sold in the United Kingdom. It is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU countries, increased regulatory complexities, and economic and political uncertainty in the region. Because of the continued uncertainty about the effects, implementation, or potential repeal of Brexit, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of Brexit or related legislation on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurthermore, Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws, health information privacy and security laws and transparency laws, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims and physician transparency laws. Our business practices and relationships with providers are subject to scrutiny under these laws. We may also be subject to privacy and security regulation related to patient, customer, employee and other third-party information by both the federal government and the states and\nforeign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. The U.S. government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $74,792 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. These laws can apply to manufacturers who provide information on coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill third-party payers. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Sunshine Act under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, which require certain applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to the DHHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, which is defined broadly to include other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations, to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,052 per failure up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $55,910 per violation, not to exceed $1.68 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. State attorneys general can also bring a civil action to enjoin a HIPAA violation or to obtain statutory damages on behalf of residents of his or her state;\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or patients; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers, foreign and state laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u2022\nstate laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.\nThese laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our business, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our r-SNM System. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.\nTo enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and responding to any such challenge or investigation would be costly and divert the attention of our management. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other healthcare regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe may be subject to, or may in the future become subject to, U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Ensuring compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.\nAs described above, in the conduct of our business, we may at times process personal data, including health-related personal data. The U.S. federal government and various states have adopted or proposed laws, regulations, guidelines and rules for the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. We may also be subject to U.S. federal rules, regulations and guidance concerning data security for medical devices, including guidance from the FDA. State privacy and security laws vary from state to state and, in some cases, can impose more\nrestrictive requirements than U.S. federal law. Where state laws are more protective, we must comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties that may be imposed for failure to comply with state law, some states also provide for private rights of action to individuals for misuse of personal information.\nThe EU also has laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use and processing of personal data obtained from individuals in the EU, which are often more restrictive than those in the United States and which restrict transfers of personal data to the United States unless certain requirements are met. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. In addition, these rules are constantly under scrutiny. For example, following a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in October 2015, transferring personal data to U.S. companies that had certified as members of the U.S. Safe Harbor Scheme was declared invalid. In July 2016 the European Commission adopted the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Framework which replaces the Safe Harbor Scheme. However, this framework is under review and there is currently litigation challenging other EU mechanisms for adequate data transfers (i.e., the standard contractual clauses). It is uncertain whether the Privacy Shield Framework and/or the standard contractual clauses will be similarly invalidated by the European courts. We rely on a mixture of mechanisms to transfer personal data from our EU business to the U.S., and could be impacted by changes in law as a result of a future review of these transfer mechanisms by European regulators under the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or the GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the European courts.\nAny actual or perceived failure by us or the third parties with whom we work to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information, may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by European Data Protection Authorities and U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities, fines and penalties, litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers, their patients and other healthcare professionals to lose trust in us, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws in the EU are under constant reform. Since May 25, 2018, we have been subject to the requirements of the GDPR because we are processing personal data in the EU and/or offering goods to, or monitoring the behavior of, individuals in the EU. The GDPR implements more stringent administrative requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, additional obligations when we contract with service providers, and more robust rights for individuals over their personal data. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. If we do not comply with our obligations under the GDPR, we could be exposed to significant fines of up to \u20ac20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\nOur failure to obtain necessary U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, authorizations, and comply with applicable FCC regulations, could impair our ability to commercialize our r-SNM System in the United States.\nBecause our r-SNM System includes a wireless radio frequency transmitter and receiver, it is subject to equipment authorization requirements in the United States. The FCC requires advance clearance of all radio frequency devices before they can be imported, sold or marketed in the United States. These clearances ensure that the proposed products comply with FCC radio frequency emission and power level standards and will not cause interference. We intend to submit an equipment certification application for non-experimental use to the FCC for our r-SNM System. Our r-SNM System has not received FCC approval for non-experimental use, and it could take several months to receive such approval. If FCC approval is obtained, it will be based on the current system design and specifications. Any modifications to our r-SNM System may require new or further FCC approval before we are permitted to market and sell a modified system, and it could take several months to obtain such new or modified approval. FCC approval has no impact on whether we will receive PMA approval.\nIn addition, applicable FCC requirements will restrict us to a particular band of frequencies for transmitting data in support of specific diagnostic or therapeutic functions. Failure to comply with all applicable restrictions on the use of such frequencies, or unforeseeable difficulties with the use of such frequencies, could impede our ability to\ncommercialize our r-SNM System and could subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. In addition, any change to our transmission frequency following receipt of FCC approval may require us to obtain additional, or modified, regulatory approvals, which would be costly and time-consuming.\nHealthcare policy changes, including recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States, which made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other ways in which it may affect our business, the Affordable Care Act:\n\u2022\nimposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions (described in more detail below), although the effective rate paid may be lower. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019. Absent further legislative action, the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting January 1, 2020;\n\u2022\nestablished a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;\n\u2022\nimplemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u2022\nexpanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs.\nWe do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. The taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors for our r-SNM System, and/or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The federal government may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Most recently, the TCJA was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. Additionally, all or a portion of the Affordable Care Act and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge, which could result in lower numbers of insured individuals, reduced coverage for insured individuals and adversely affect our business.\nWe expect additional state and federal healthcare policies and reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit reimbursement for healthcare products and services or otherwise result in reduced demand for our r-SNM System, or additional pricing pressure, and have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our customers. Any changes of, or uncertainty with respect to, future coverage or reimbursement rates could affect demand for our r-SNM System, which in turn could impact our ability to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which may be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities may involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials. Although we believe the safety procedures of our manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our manufacturers\u2019 use of these materials and interrupt their business operations which could adversely affect our business.\nCompliance with securities rules relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may require us and our suppliers to incur substantial expense and may result in disclosure by us that certain minerals used in products we manufacture or contract to manufacture are not \u201cDRC conflict free.\u201d\nBecause we manufacture or contract to manufacture a product that contains titanium, we may be required under rules promulgated by the SEC governing disclosure of the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) to determine whether those minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of our r-SNM System and, if so, conduct a country of origin inquiry with respect to all such minerals. If any such minerals may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, or any of its adjoining countries, or covered countries, then we must conduct diligence on the source and chain of custody of those conflict minerals to determine if they originated in one of the covered countries and, if so, whether they financed or benefited armed groups in the covered countries. Disclosures relating to the products that may contain conflict minerals, the country of origin of those minerals and whether they are \u201cDRC conflict free\u201d must be provided in a Form SD (and accompanying conflict minerals report, if required, to disclose the diligence undertaken by us in sourcing the minerals and our conclusions relating to such diligence). If we are required to submit a conflict minerals report, that report must be audited by an independent auditor pursuant to existing government auditing standards. Compliance with this disclosure rule may be very time-consuming for our management and personnel (as well as time-consuming for our suppliers) and could involve the expenditure of significant amounts of money by us and them. Disclosures mandated by this rule, which can be perceived by the market to be \u201cnegative,\u201d may cause customers to refuse to purchase our r-SNM System. The cost of compliance with the rule could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we or any of our current or future licensors, including AMF, are unable to maintain, obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights or attempt to do the same.\nOur commercial success depends in part on ours and any of our current or future licensors\u2019, including AMF\u2019s, success in obtaining, maintaining and protecting patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights and proprietary technology in the United States and elsewhere. If we or any of our current or future licensors, including AMF, do not adequately protect our respective intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nOur intellectual property coverage includes protection provided by patents and other intellectual property licensed through the License Agreement with AMF. We rely on AMF to maintain the patents and otherwise protect the intellectual property we license from them. If in the future we no longer have rights to one or more of these licensed patents or other licensed intellectual property, our intellectual property coverage may be compromised, which in turn could affect our ability to protect our r-SNM System and defend it against competitors.\nWe own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our r-SNM System and several issued patents and patent applications were licensed from AMF in 2013 pursuant to the License Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we wholly owned 19 issued U.S. patents and 22 issued foreign patents, and 15 pending U.S. patent applications and 57 pending foreign patent applications. We also license from AMF 30 issued U.S. patents and four\npending U.S. patent applications, as well as 41 issued foreign patents and 25 pending foreign patent applications. Issued patents owned or used by us will expire between 2023 and 2037.\nOur patents may not have, and any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents may not include, claims with a scope sufficient to adequately protect our r-SNM System, or any additional features we develop for our r-SNM System or any new products. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related to or competitive with our r-SNM System, and, may have filed, or may file, patent applications, and, may have received, or may receive patents, that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position. The patent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal and factual questions, and therefore, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent, or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we may own may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision may result in a third party receiving a patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our r-SNM System.\nThough an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors could purchase our r-SNM System and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, circumvent or design around our patents, or develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. We may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors, former employees and current employees. In addition, third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own. If these developments were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our sales or market position. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nOur ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the components that are used in their products. In addition, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor\u2019s or potential competitor\u2019s product. We may not prevail in some, or any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful. Any litigation to enforce or defend our patent rights, even if we were to prevail, could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some, or all, of the claims in one or more of our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering our r-SNM System are invalidated or found unenforceable, or, if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered our r-SNM System, our competitive position could be harmed, or, we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nour patents, or our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to fully protect our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nany of our pending patent applications will issue as patents;\n\u2022\nwe will be able to successfully commercialize our r-SNM System on a substantial scale, if approved, before our relevant patents have expired;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to make, or file for patent protection of, the inventions covered by each of our patents and pending patent applications, as is dictated by the applicable national patent laws in effect at the time of a patent application being filed;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to file patent applications for these inventions, where such rules are applicable;\n\u2022\nothers will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents;\n\u2022\nany of our patents will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or\n\u2022\nour commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others.\nIn addition, we rely in part upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and continuing technological innovation which may not yet, or may never be, patented, to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. It is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. In addition, if the employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Further, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors, which would harm our business.\nWe are reliant on the ability of AMF, as licensor of certain intellectual property contained in our r-SNM System, and may be reliant on, future licensors to maintain their intellectual property and protect their intellectual property against misappropriation, infringement or other violation. In some instances, we may not have primary control over AMF\u2019s, or our other future licensors\u2019, patent prosecution activities. With respect to licensed patents that were issued to our licensors, or patents that may issue on patent applications, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. As a licensee, we are reliant on AMF to defend any third-party claims or consent to our defending them on their behalf. Our licensors may not defend or prosecute such actions as vigorously or in the manner that we would have if entitled to do so, and we will be subject to any judgment or settlement resulting from such actions and our business could be adversely affected.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement against us or any of our current or future licensors, including AMF, could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our r-SNM System, or affect our stock price.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to avoid infringement of the proprietary rights of third parties. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Our competitors in both the United States and internationally, many of which have substantially greater resources, and, may have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our r-SNM System. We do not always conduct independent reviews of patents issued to third parties. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived, so there may be applications for other patents now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware that our r-SNM System may infringe. There may also be patent applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued as patents, could be asserted against us. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the technology and medical device industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes reexamination or review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our r-SNM System or will develop future product candidates. As the technology and medical device industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk continues, or possibly increases, that our r-SNM System may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we, or any of our current or future licensors, including AMF, are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover our r-SNM System, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our product unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product unless we obtain a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn addition to claims of patent infringement, third parties may bring claims against us, or AMF, asserting misappropriation of proprietary technology or other information in the development, manufacture and commercialization of our r-SNM System. Defense of such a claim would require dedicated time and resources, which time and resources could otherwise be used by us toward the maintenance of our own intellectual property and the development and commercialization of our r-SNM System, or by any of our current or future licensors for operational upkeep and manufacturing of our r-SNM System.\nThe legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings may be low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can. We may also occasionally use these proceedings to challenge the patent rights of others.\nAny lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nlose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others;\n\u2022\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\npay the attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\nredesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive, or infeasible; and\n\u2022\nattempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, or, from third parties whom may attempt to license rights that they have or do not have.\nAny litigation or claim against us or AMF, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and, could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from commercialization of our r-SNM System, or harm our reputation. If we or AMF are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages) and/or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our infringing products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our r-SNM System to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign the infringing product in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. If we fail to obtain any required licenses, or make any necessary changes to our r-SNM System, including future technologies, we may have to withdraw our r-SNM System from the market or may be unable to commercialize our r-SNM System.\nIn addition, third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or indemnify our customers for any\ncosts associated with their own initiation or defense of infringement claims, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed or settle, we may be forced to pay damages or settlement payments on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our r-SNM System.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business or competitive position could be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely upon other non-patent protection, such as: trademark, or, trade secret protection, as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. Despite the existence of such confidentiality agreements, or other contractual restrictions, we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential proprietary information or trade secrets by employees, consultants, vendors, and third parties. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using commonly accepted physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and, recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to fully protect our interests. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our r-SNM System that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed, or misappropriated a trade secret, can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and, the outcome is unpredictable. Even though we use commonly accepted security measures, trade secret violations are often a matter of state law, and the criteria for protection of trade secrets can vary among different jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our trade secrets effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. If we face similar challenges with respect to material intellectual property matters, this could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our foreign patents or our other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from the commercialization of our r-SNM System. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of our intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may, in the future, make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain\nintellectual property or we may lose our rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals who previously worked with other companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. We may not be successful in defending these claims, and even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees and we may lose valuable intellectual property rights if we fail in defending any such claims. A loss of key personnel or their work product could diminish or prevent our ability to commercialize our r-SNM System, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent changes in U.S. patent laws may limit our ability to obtain, defend and/or enforce our patents.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cAIA\u201d) includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA, and in particular, the first to file provisions, which became effective on March 16, 2013. The first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor to patent an invention if that inventor is not the first to file an application for patenting that invention, even if such inventor was the first to invent such invention. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business.\nThe AIA could also increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement and defense of our issued patents. For example, the AIA provides that an administrative tribunal known as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) provides a venue for challenging the validity of patents at a cost that is much lower than district court litigation and on timelines that are much faster. Although it is not clear what, if any, long-term impact the PTAB proceedings will have on the operation of our business, the initial results of patent challenge proceedings before the PTAB since its inception in 2013 have resulted in the invalidation of many U.S. patent claims. The availability of the PTAB as a lower-cost, faster and potentially more potent tribunal for challenging patents could increase the likelihood that our own patents will be challenged, thereby increasing the uncertainties and costs of maintaining and enforcing them.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our patent licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to the License Agreement with AMF and we may be a party to future license agreements. One or more of our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license. If successful, this could result in our loss of the right to use the licensed intellectual property, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our r-SNM System, as well as harm our competitive business position and our business prospects. In particular, the License Agreement imposes various development, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations or otherwise materially breach the License Agreement, AMF may have the right to terminate the License Agreement, in which event we would not be able to develop or market our r-SNM System. In addition, any claims asserted against us by AMF may be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of key personnel from business operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for medical technology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements of regulatory approval or disapproval of our r-SNM System and any future enhancements to our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nadverse results from or delays in clinical studies of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nunanticipated safety concerns related to the use of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory or legal actions or changes affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nany termination or loss of rights under the License Agreement;\n\u2022\nany voluntary or regulatory mandated product recalls;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers or suppliers or any future strategic partnerships;\n\u2022\nintroductions and announcements of new technologies by us, any commercialization partners or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions and announcements;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of competitive products or therapies in the SNM market;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment of our r-SNM System;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the medical technology industry and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our future competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or guidance, including our ability to meet our future revenue and operating profit or loss estimates or guidance;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our earnings releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of our stock by directors, officers or significant stockholders, or the expectation that such sales might occur;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions, including the size and growth, if any, of the market;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the market or industry;\n\u2022\noperating and stock performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us and overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us, our third-party manufacturers or other parties on which we rely or litigation against our general industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities and the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 common stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the equity research analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or issues other unfavorable commentary or research the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nOur directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nBased on the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 31, 2018, our officers, directors and principal stockholders each holding more than 5% of our common stock, collectively, will control approximately 59.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to control the management and affairs of our company and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could attempt to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if such change in control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets, and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perceptions that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. As a result, this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that these sales may occur, could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. 21,269,965 shares of our common stock are currently restricted as a result of securities laws or 180-day lock-up agreements (which may be waived with or without notice by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC) but will be able to be sold beginning 180 days after October 30, 2018, unless held by one of our affiliates, in which case the resale of those securities will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. We, our directors, executive officers, and substantially all of our other existing equityholders have agreed that, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the underwriters for our IPO, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, we and they will not, subject to certain exceptions and extensions, during the period ending 180-days after the date of the final prospectus relating to our IPO, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock or publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC may in their discretion and at any time without notice release all or any portion of the shares of our common stock subject to the lock-up.\nIn addition, holders of an aggregate of up to 16,701,297 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. In addition, we have filed a registration\nstatement with the SEC covering shares of our common stock outstanding under our 2014 Plan and available for future issuance under the 2018 Plan, and may file future registration statements covering shares of our common stock for issuance under any future equity incentive plans. Upon effectiveness of such registration statements, any shares subsequently issued under such plans will be eligible for sale in the public market, except to the extent that they are restricted by the lock-up agreements referred to above and subject to compliance with Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates. Sales of a large number of the shares issued under these plans in the public market could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs as a result of being a public company, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with corporate governance requirements that are applicable to us as a public company, including rules and regulations of the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and the Exchange Act, as well as the listing requirements (\u201cNasdaq Marketplace Rules\u201d), of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). These rules and regulations are expected to significantly increase our accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. We also expect these rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to maintain our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Accordingly, increases in costs incurred as a result of becoming a publicly traded company may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in us, and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we will need to undertake various actions, including implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act, is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate and weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls when we become subject to this requirement could negatively affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we may be required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may be unable to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of our second annual report or the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), depending on whether we choose to rely on certain exemptions set forth in the JOBS Act.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and\nforms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nStockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as under Delaware law, could discourage a takeover.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove current members of our management team. These include the following provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the ownership of a hostile bidder significantly;\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our board of directors and that a director may only be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chair of the board, our Chief Executive Officer or by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration by our company of a take-over proposal or to take certain corporate actions, including the removal of directors.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein and the claim not being one which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. In addition, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. In addition, pursuant to the Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends without the prior written consent of Silicon Valley Bank and future debt instruments may materially restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we do not pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and the reduced reporting requirements available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d and \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the U.S. federal securities laws. For as long as we remain an emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nbeing permitted to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related selected financial data and management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure;\n\u2022\nan exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, registration statements and proxy statements; and\n\u2022\nexemptions from the requirements to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.\nTo the extent we take advantage of any of these exemptions, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies.\nWe could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 date before that time, in which case, we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Even if we do not qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies.\nInvestors could find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our trading price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 18190, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "AXNX"}
