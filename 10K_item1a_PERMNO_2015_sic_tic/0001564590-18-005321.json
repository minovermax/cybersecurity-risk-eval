{"cik": "1610853", "company": "HELIUS MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this Annual Report in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks. The risks described below may not be all of the risks facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe have a very limited operating history and have incurred substantial net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than cash and our ownership of all of the outstanding shares of NHC, which is our wholly owned subsidiary. NHC was incorporated in Delaware on January 22, 2013 and has had limited operations to date.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and nine months ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $28.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, and used cash in operations of $19.3 million and $7.9 million respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $66.4 million as of December 31, 2017. Our losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with our design, manufacturing and development, research and development activities, stock-based compensation, legal, advertising, marketing and investor relations, and general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. Even if we are successful in obtaining marketing authorization from the FDA in order to launch our PoNS Treatment in the United States or foreign regulatory authorities to launch outside of the United States, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to research and develop and seek regulatory marketing authorization for our product candidate.\nWe are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources, lack of revenue and the risk that we will not achieve our growth objective. If sales revenue from any product candidates that receive marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory body is insufficient, if we are unable to develop and commercialize any of our potential product candidates, or if our product development is delayed, we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe will require additional financing to carry out our plan of operations and if we are unable to obtain such financing, our business may fail.\nWe currently have limited working capital and liquid assets. We held cash totaling $5.6 million at December 31, 2017. To date we have not generated any revenue from the sales of products or of services. There are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to generate revenue, including but not limited to FDA marketing authorization of the PoNS device for mild- to moderate- TBI, manufacturing of a commercially-viable version of the PoNS device, obtaining favorable reimbursement from third party payers, and demonstration of effectiveness sufficient to generate commercial orders by customers for our product. While we are seeking additional funding, we do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish all of these conditions necessary for us to generate revenue, and we do not expect to generate revenue in an amount sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. We will therefore require substantial additional funds in order to continue to conduct the research and development and regulatory authorization activities necessary to bring our product to market, to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities and to develop other product candidates. Our existing capital resources will not be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of the development and commercialization of our current product and our product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future development and commercialization of our product candidate or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our current product candidate or potential future product candidates for which we obtain regulatory marketing authorization. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory authorization for our current product candidate and any potential future product candidates. We may be unable to raise the additional funding to finance our business on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing as needed, we may be forced to reduce the scope of our operations and planned capital expenditures or sell certain assets, including intellectual property, and we may be forced to cease or wind down operations, seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or liquidate and dissolve our company, which would have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock..\nRaising additional capital by issuing securities or through debt financings or licensing arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidate on terms unfavorable to us.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidate, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidate, or otherwise grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for our product candidate or our preclinical product candidates, or grant rights to develop and market potential future product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our product development and commercialization goals and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements. We may be unable to continue to operate without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future.\nIn connection with our management\u2019s assessment, our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. For example, our existing capital resources will be insufficient to fund our operations beyond the first half of 2018. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements, and investors will likely lose all or a part of their investment. Future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product Candidate\nWe currently only have one product candidate, which is still in development, and we have not obtained authorization from the FDA to commercially distribute the device in the United States, a CE Mark for commercial distribution in Europe, from Health Canada for commercial distribution in Canada or from the TGA for commercial distribution in Australia, and we may never obtain such authorizations.\nWe currently have no products authorized for commercial distribution. We are developing the PoNS Treatment for use in the neuromodulation market, but we cannot begin marketing and selling the device in the United States, Europe, Canada or Australia until we obtain authorizations from the FDA, EU, Health Canada or TGA, respectively. We have not yet submitted applications for regulatory authorization in any of these jurisdictions. The process of obtaining regulatory authorization is expensive and time-consuming and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of a product. Changes in regulatory policy, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the authorization of a product candidate or rejection of a regulatory application altogether. The FDA has substantial discretion in the de novo review and authorization processes and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for authorization and require additional pre-clinical, clinical, or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Any marketing authorization from the FDA we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-market commitments that render the product candidate not commercially viable. If our attempts to obtain marketing authorization are unsuccessful, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow our business, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are able to complete development of the PoNS device and obtain authorization of the PoNS device for the treatment of chronic balance deficit in patients with mild- to moderate- TBI in the United States, Europe, Canada or Australia, we plan to develop the PoNS device for other indications, or symptoms caused by neurological disorders. We would be required to commit our own resources to fund development of any other indications and each would require separate FDA authorization. The costs of such development efforts and FDA authorizations could be substantial and would likely require additional funding, and each such indication would be subject to the same foregoing risks and uncertainties for FDA authorization.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PoNS device to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nBefore obtaining marketing authorization from regulatory authorities for the sale of the PoNS Treatment, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Clinical trial are expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Delays can be costly and could negatively affect our ability to complete a clinical trial and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize the PoNS Treatment. If we are unable to complete clinical trials, or are unsuccessful in doing so, we will be unable to advance the PoNS device to regulatory authorization and commercialization, which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations.\nOur PoNS technology is a new, \u201cuntested\u201d form of neurostimulation therapy, and the medical community tends not to adopt new therapies very rapidly. If physicians elect not to prescribe the PoNS Treatment, or if we cannot train physical therapists in the supervision of the use of the PoNS Treatment, we will be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.\nOur deployment strategy in the civilian population depends on physicians prescribing the PoNS Treatment to patients with relevant neurological disorders and physical therapists being trained in the supervision of patients\u2019 use of our treatment. While the effectiveness of our PoNS technology to treat balance disorders related to TBI or any other neurological disorder has not been established in studies conducted in a controlled environment designed to produce scientifically significant results, it remains a new, \u201cuntested,\u201d and therefore unproven, treatment. Such technologies are usually more slowly adopted by the medical community as the medical community tends to be very conservative. Physicians may elect not to use our products for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nlack or perceived lack of evidence supporting the beneficial characteristics of our technology;\n\u2022\nlimited long-term data on the use of PoNS technology for therapy;\n\u2022\nphysicians\u2019 perception that there are insufficient advantages of our product relative to currently available products;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively train physical therapists in the supervision of patients\u2019 use of the therapy;\n\u2022\nhospitals may choose not to purchase our product;\n\u2022\ngroup purchasing organizations may choose not to contract for our product, thus limiting availability of our products to hospital purchasers;\n\u2022\nlack of coverage or adequate payment from managed care plans and other third-party payers for our product;\n\u2022\nMedicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers may limit or not permit reimbursement for our product; and\n\u2022\nthe development or improvement of competitive products.\nIf the medical community is slow to adopt, or declines to adopt our PoNS Treatment for neurostimulation therapy, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, if any, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere is limited market awareness of our product and the neuromodulation market is new and uncertain.\nThere is currently limited market awareness of our product. In order to succeed, we must, among other things, increase market awareness of our PoNS Treatment and implement a sales and marketing strategy. If we fail in any of these endeavors or experience delays in pursuing them, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated. In addition, if the neuromodulation market fails to become more integrated in neurological therapy, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nWe face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change, and our competitors may develop devices or products that are more advanced or more effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully market the PoNS device.\nThe neurostimulation market involves rapidly developing technology. Our competitors in the industry are predominantly large companies with longer operating histories, with significantly easier access to capital and other resources and an established product pipeline than us. The combined clinical research and product development done by the industry, including by us and all of our competitors, is foundational, and neurostimulation has slowly become integrated into neurological therapy. This foundation has allowed for new and innovative neurostimulation companies to enter the market. New developments occur rapidly, and we anticipate that we will face increasing competition as new companies enter our market.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to establish ourselves in the neurostimulation market, or, if established, that we will be able to maintain our market position, if any. Our commercial opportunity may be reduced if our competitors develop new or improved products that are more convenient, more effective or less expensive than our product candidate. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory marketing authorization for their products more rapidly or earlier than we may obtain marketing authorization for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render the PoNS Treatment uneconomical or obsolete.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe are, and will continue to be, dependent in significant part on outside scientists and third-party research institutions for our research and development in order to be able to commercialize our product candidate.\nWe currently have a limited number of employees and resources available to perform the research and development necessary to commercialize our PoNS Treatment and potential future product candidates. We therefore rely, and will continue to rely, on third-party research institutions, collaborators and consultants for this capability.\nOur subsidiary NHC is party to a sole source contract with the U.S. Army. Pursuant to the sole source contract, the U.S. Army has agreed to cooperate with NHC on research to determine if the PoNS Treatment can be developed for commercial use in assisting physical therapy in the treatment of soldiers and others with balance disorders resulting from mild- to moderate- TBI; however, NHC is solely responsible for sponsoring the registrational trial and the sole regulatory sponsor for the PoNS treatment for this indication. The Army Laboratories, the inventors and background patent owners of the PoNS device have agreed through a collaborative research and development agreement, or the CRADA to support the execution of clinical studies for the PoNS device as a treatment for other mutually agreed upon military-relevant neurological disorders, which could include tinnitus, PTSD and pain and any subsequent indications identified by the parties. The amount of such support, if any, and the terms of such responsibility to support such clinical studies are not yet negotiated and we have no assurance that we can ultimately reach agreement with the Army Laboratories on such amount or terms of support, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. Army or USAMRMC will not otherwise attempt to renegotiate its responsibilities under the CRADA or the sole-source contractual agreement, respectively. The Army Laboratories may terminate their obligations under the CRADA at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to us. If there are insufficient funds available to cover the necessary research and development costs for our product, the Army Laboratories could terminate the CRADA and cease research and development efforts, which could jeopardize our ability to commercialize our PoNS Treatment.\nIf we fail to obtain FDA authorization for commercialization of or otherwise fail to ensure that the PoNS device is available for purchase by the U.S. Government by December 31, 2018, we are subject to significant risk of loss of data and proprietary rights and to certain contractual penalties.\nUnder the CRADA, if we fail to obtain FDA marketing authorization of the PoNS device by December 31, 2018 or otherwise fail to ensure commercialization of the PoNS Treatment is available for purchase by the U.S. Government by December 31, 2021, we may forfeit the right to pursue commercialization on our own. Specifically, in either such case, we will be required to (i) transfer possession, ownership and sponsorship of any regulatory application, and correspondence supporting the PoNS technology to the USAMRMC and (ii) provide the U.S. Government with a non-exclusive, irrevocable license to any patent, copyright, data rights, proprietary information and regulatory information, in order to permit the U.S. Government to pursue commercialization on its own. Any such loss of our ability to exclusively market and sell the PoNS Treatment would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, under our Strategic Agreement with A&B (HK) Company Ltd., or A&B, if we fail to obtain FDA marketing authorization for commercialization, or otherwise fail to ensure that the PoNS device is available for purchase by the U.S. Government, by December 31, 2021, we may be required to pay a $2.0 million contract penalty to A&B.\nWe depend on third parties for the manufacture of our product and the loss of these third-party manufacturers could harm our business.\nWe will be dependent on our third-party scale manufacturing partner to manufacture and supply our PoNS device for clinical and commercial purposes. Our new contract manufacturer will manufacture the units for our engineering and device verification testing and will build the launch quantities for our early commercialization. This contract manufacturer also has the capability to warehouse and ship our products to customers and multiple locations to expand capacity and back-up capabilities. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers to supply us with our PoNS device to provide such other distribution and warranty services exposes us to risks that could delay our sales or result in higher costs or lost product revenues. In addition, our manufacturers could encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control and quality assurance or suffer shortages of qualified personnel, which could result in their inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our commercially available product to meet market demand. Our third-party manufacturer and distributor may also fail to follow and remain in compliance with the FDA-mandated Quality System Regulations, or QSR, compliance which is required for all\nmedical devices, or fail to document their compliance to QSRs, either of which could lead to significant delays in the availability of materials for our product and/or FDA enforcement actions against them and/or us.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our product that meet our specifications and quality standards, it will be difficult for us to compete effectively. While we have supply agreements in place with our manufacturer, and they may change the terms of our future orders or choose not to supply us with products in the future. Furthermore, if such manufacturer fails to perform their obligations, we may be forced to purchase our product from other third-party manufacturers, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms or in sufficient time, if at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. We will also need to obtain FDA approval for any new manufacturers. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer or the reverification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to produce and distribute our product in a timely manner.\nIf the U.S. Army terminates the sole-source cost sharing contract or decides in the future not to purchase our product candidate, we would be forced to find new partners or customers in order to continue advancing the PoNS device.\nThe U.S. Army is under no obligation to purchase the PoNS device from us. If the U.S. Army were to eventually decide not to purchase our product, we would need to find other buyers for our product. If the U.S. Army were to decline to purchase our product, we may have more difficulty persuading other third parties to purchase our product, which would materially harm our business.\nIn order to be successful, we must expand our products beyond our single product by commercializing new potential product candidates, but we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion and at expected costs, or at all.\nIn order to be successful, we will need to expand our product lines beyond our PoNS Treatment for mild- to moderate-TBI, which is currently our only indication for our only product candidate. To succeed in our commercialization efforts, we must effectively continue product development and testing, obtain regulatory authorizations, and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities. There is no assurance that we will succeed in developing a future product candidate or in bringing any of our current or potential future product candidates to market. If we fail in bringing our product candidates to market, or experience delays in doing so, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated.\nThe development of additional products is subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of new, state of the art products, and products based on new technologies. These risks include: (a) delays in product development or manufacturing; (b) unplanned expenditures for product development or manufacturing; (c) failure of new products to have the desired effect or an acceptable accuracy and/or safety profile; (d) emergence of superior or equivalent products; (e) failure by any potential collaborative partners to successfully develop products; and (f) the dependence on third parties for the manufacture, development and sale of our products. Because of these risks, our research and development efforts or those of potential collaborative partners may not result in any commercially viable products. If a significant portion of these development efforts is not successfully completed, or any products are not commercially successful, we are less likely to generate significant revenues, or become profitable. The failure to perform such activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf our intellectual property protection is inadequate, competitors may gain access to our technology and undermine our competitive position.\nWe regard our intended and future intellectual property as important to our success, and we intend to rely on patent law to protect our proprietary rights. Despite our precautions, unauthorized third parties may copy certain portions of our devices or products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may seek additional patents in the future. We do not know if any future patent application will be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all, or whether any patents we receive will be challenged or invalidated. Thus, we cannot assure you that any intellectual property rights that we may receive can be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our means of protecting any proprietary rights we may receive in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop a similar technology. Any failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including intellectual property litigation, such as patent infringement claims, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe, as well as certain of our directors and officers, may be subject to claims or lawsuits. These lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or product lines. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, our commercial success will also depend, in part, on not infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that the technologies and products used or developed by us will not infringe such rights. If such infringement occurs and we are not able to obtain a license from the relevant third party, we will not be able to continue the development, manufacture, use, or sale of any such infringing technology or product. There can be no assurance that necessary licenses to third-party technology will be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms. In some cases, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties. Any potential litigation could result in substantial costs to, and diversion of, our resources and could have a material and adverse impact on us.\nAn adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to cease using the subject technology or require us to license the subject technology from the third party, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nBefore we can market and sell our products, we will be required to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. These authorizations will take significant time and require significant research, development, and clinical study expenditures, and ultimately may not succeed.\nBefore we begin to label and market the PoNS Treatment for use in the United States, we are required to obtain authorization from the FDA under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, approval of a de novo reclassification petition for our product, or approval of pre-market application from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. We intend to utilize the de novo classification procedures to seek marketing authorization for the PoNS device for the treatment of mild- to moderate- TBI, because there is currently no predicate cleared or approved by the FDA for commercial distribution and no existing classification decision by the FDA for such a device. We will also be required to comply with costly and more often time-consuming compliance by foreign regulatory authorities if we want to sell our products outside of the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, or completing the de novo classification process, to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to successfully obtain pre-market reviews on a timely basis, if at all.\nIf the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for the PoNS Treatment for mild- to moderate-TBI, introducing the product could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our launch to be delayed. In addition, the FDA may determine that the PoNS device requires the more costly, lengthy and uncertain pre-market approval process. For example, if the FDA disagrees with our determination that the de novo classification procedures are the appropriate path to obtain marketing authorization for the PoNS device, the FDA may require us to submit a PMA application, which is generally more costly and more burdensome and can take several years from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained.\nMoreover, we are currently developing the PoNS device for other potential indications. At this time, we do not know what pathways FDA or other regulatory authorities will require us to utilize for these additional indications. We may be required to pursue marketing authorization via more rigorous pathways, such as a PMA application in the United States, which may require more development work than we are currently planning. This would delay the potential marketing authorization for such indications, potentially make marketing authorization more difficult to obtain, and increase our costs.\nObtaining FDA marketing authorization will be costly, may result in time-consuming delays and will subject us to ongoing compliance costs and regulatory risk for non-compliance.\nObtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or PMA approval for medical devices can be expensive and uncertain, and generally takes from several months to several years, and generally requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. Notwithstanding the expense, these efforts may never result in FDA authorization. Even if we were to obtain regulatory authorization, it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive, in which case we would not be permitted to market our product for those uses.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny authorization of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our product candidate is safe and effective for its intended users;\n\u2022\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support authorization, where required; and\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its authorization policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay marketing authorization of our products under development. For example, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the program, and in January 2011, announced several proposed actions intended to reform the review process governing the clearance of medical devices. The FDA intends these reform actions to improve the efficiency and transparency of the clearance process, as well as bolster patient safety. In addition, as part of the FDASIA the U.S. Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \u201cMedical Device Regulatory Improvements\u201d and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our product candidate could prevent us from generating revenue from our product candidate and adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nEven if granted, a 510(k) clearance, de novo down-classification, or pre-market approval for any future product would likely place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or sold, and FDA will continue to place considerable restrictions on our products and operations. For example, the manufacture of medical devices must comply with FDA\u2019s QSR. In addition, manufacturers must register their manufacturing facilities, list the products with FDA, and comply with requirements relating to labeling, marketing, complaint handling, adverse event and medical device reporting, reporting of corrections and removals, and import and export. FDA monitors compliance with the QSR and these other requirements through periodic inspections. If our facilities or those of our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, or if we or our manufacturers or suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, the regulatory authority could take enforcement action, including any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications of repair, replacement, refunds, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying requests for marketing authorization of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing marketing authorizations that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nrefusing to provide Certificates for Foreign Government;\n\u2022\nrefusing to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022\npursuing criminal prosecution.\nAdditionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our product candidate and dissuade our customers from using our product candidate, if and when it is authorized for marketing.\nWe expect to be required to conduct clinical trials to support regulatory marketing authorization of some of our potential future product candidates. We have limited experience in the clinical trials process, they may proceed more slowly than anticipated, and we cannot be certain that our product candidate will be shown to be safe and effective for human use.\nIn order to commercialize our product candidate in the United States, we may be required by the FDA to submit an application for PMA for review and approval by the FDA. A PMA application must be submitted to the FDA if our device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process, down-classified via the de novo process, or is not exempt from premarket review by the FDA. We could also be required to submit a PMA application for other potential future product candidates. If we are required by the FDA to submit a PMA application, the FDA will also require us to conduct clinical trials. The FDA could also require us to provide the FDA with clinical trial data to support any 510(k) premarket notifications and we are required to submit clinical trial data to support the de novo down classification of our PoNS device. We will receive marketing authorization from the FDA to commercialize products requiring a clinical trial only if we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, through well-designed and properly conducted clinical trials, that our\nproduct candidate is safe and effective and otherwise meet the appropriate standards required for marketing authorization for specified indications.\nClinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and are subject to substantial and unanticipated delays. Before we may begin clinical trials, we may be required to submit and obtain approval for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, that describes, among other things, the manufacture of, and controls for, the device and a complete investigational plan. Clinical trials generally involve a substantial number of patients in a multi-year study. Because we do not have the experience or the infrastructure necessary to conduct clinical trials, we will have to hire one or more contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct trials on our behalf. CRO contract negotiations may be costly and time consuming and we will rely heavily on the CRO to ensure that our trials are conducted in accordance with regulatory and industry standards. We may encounter problems with our clinical trials and any of those problems could cause us or the FDA to suspend those trials or delay the analysis of the data derived from them. Moreover, any failure to abide by the applicable regulatory requirements by us, our CROs, and/or clinical trial sites may result in regulatory enforcement action against us or such third parties.\nWe will be substantially dependent on third parties to conduct our clinical trials.\nAs we are required to conduct clinical trials to obtain FDA marketing authorization, we need to rely heavily on third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and as a result will have limited control over the clinical investigators and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional nonclinical or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications or may subject us or them to regulatory enforcement actions. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials may be required to be conducted with a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory marketing authorization process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting our clinical trials are not and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical, and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory marketing authorization of or successfully commercialize our product candidate. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidate would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nIf any of our relationships terminate with these third-party CROs, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO begins work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to secure contracts with workers\u2019 compensation and third-party administrators or rehabilitation clinics who treat patients with balance and gait issues associated with TBI or to launch our clinical experience programs, this could have a negative impact on our intended sales and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe intend to launch clinical experience programs but there are no guarantees we will be able to get the contracts in place for the timely execution of the programs. Our clinical experience program also contemplates conducting training at certain clinical centers around the United States in the use of the PoNS Treatment along with the specific therapeutic protocol, with participants selected based on an established criterion and we may not be successful in reaching agreement at these centers in establishing our programs at their facilities. This could have the effect of delaying our sales and marketing strategy for the PoNS Treatment. In addition, our commercialization strategy is premised on leveraging workers\u2019 compensation payers to drive early reimbursements and entice Medicaid and commercial payers through third party administrators and rehabilitation clinics. Should we fail in securing such contracts it could have a material adverse effect on our intended sales projections, which would impact our financial conditions and operating results.\nIf we are unable to obtain a reimbursement code from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services so that the PoNS device is covered under Medicare and Medicaid, this would have a negative impact on our intended sales and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe plan to submit an application to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for reimbursement code so that the PoNS Treatment is covered under Medicare and Medicaid. There can be no assurance that our application will be successful, or that we will be able to obtain a reimbursement code in a timely manner. In the event that we do not obtain a reimbursement code for the PoNS Treatment, our customers may be unable to obtain reimbursement for their purchases under private or government-sponsored insurance plans which would have a negative impact on sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, Medicare and its administrative contractors as well as other insurers must find that the PoNS device meets their medical necessity requirements for the treatment of patients with mild- to moderate- TBI or they will not pay for the treatment. In addition, there is a risk that the payment amount for the PoNS Treatment is either too low or too high to incentivize customer adoption.\nIf hospitals and other healthcare providers are unable to obtain coverage or adequate reimbursement for procedures performed with our products, our product will not likely be widely used.\nIn the United States, the commercial success of our existing product and any future products will depend, in part, on the extent to which governmental payers at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for procedures utilizing our products. Hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase our product for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payers to pay for all or part of the costs and fees associated with our products as part of a \u201cbundled\u201d rate for the associated procedures. The existence of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products and the procedures performed with them by government and private payers critical to market acceptance of our existing and future products. Neither hospitals nor physicians are likely to use our product and any future products if they do not receive adequate reimbursement for the procedures utilizing our products.\nMany private payers currently base their reimbursement policies on the coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the CMS, which administers the Medicare program. Others may adopt different coverage or reimbursement policies for procedures performed with our products, while some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, have reimbursement policies that vary from state to state, some of which may not pay for the procedures performed with our products in an adequate amount, if at all. A Medicare national or local coverage decision denying coverage for one or more of our products could result in private and other third-party payers also denying coverage for our products. Third-party payers also may deny reimbursement for our products if they determine that a product used in a procedure was not medically necessary, was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payer, or was used for an unapproved use. Unfavorable coverage or reimbursement decisions by government programs or private payers underscore the uncertainty that our products face in the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany hospitals and clinics in the United States belong to group purchasing organizations, which typically incentivize their hospital members to make a relatively large proportion of purchases from a limited number of vendors of similar products that have contracted to offer discounted prices. Accordingly, the commercial success of our products may also depend to some extent on our ability to either negotiate favorable purchase contracts with key group purchasing organizations and/or persuade hospitals and clinics to purchase our product \u201coff contract.\u201d\nThe healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private payers seek to control healthcare costs by paying service providers lower rates. While we believe that hospitals will be able to obtain coverage for procedures using our products, the level of payment available to them for such procedures may change over time. State and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, closely regulate provider payment levels and have sought to contain, and sometimes reduce, payment levels. Private payers frequently follow government payment policies and are likewise interested in controlling increases in the cost of medical care. In addition, some payers are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate\npayments to healthcare providers based on the achievement of documented quality-of-care metrics, cost efficiencies, or patient outcomes. These programs are intended to provide incentives to providers to deliver the same or better results while consuming fewer resources. As a result of these programs, and related payer efforts to reduce payment levels, hospitals and other providers are seeking ways to reduce their costs, including the amounts they pay to medical device manufacturers. We may not be able to sell our treatment profitably if third-party payers deny or discontinue coverage or reduce their levels of payment below that which we project, or if our production costs increase at a greater rate than payment levels. Adverse changes in payment rates by payers to hospitals could adversely impact our ability to market and sell our products and negatively affect our financial performance.\nIn international markets, medical device regulatory requirements and healthcare payment systems vary significantly from country to country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. We cannot assure you that our products will be considered cost-effective by international third-party payers, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payers\u2019 reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our product profitably. Any failure to receive regulatory or reimbursement approvals would negatively impact market acceptance of our products in any international markets in which those approvals are being sought.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare laws, we could face substantial penalties and financial exposure, and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe do not have a product candidate available for sale. If, however, we achieve this goal, the availability of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers would mean that many healthcare laws would place limitations and requirements on the manner in which we conduct our business, including our sales and promotional activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities. In some instances, our interactions with healthcare professionals and facilities that occurred prior to commercialization (e.g., the granting of stock options) could have implications at a later date. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others: (i) the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us if we provide coding and billing advice to customers, or under theories of \u201cimplied certification\u201d where the government and qui tam relators may allege that device companies are liable where a product that was paid for by the government in whole or in part was promoted \u201coff-label,\u201d lacked necessary marketing authorization, or failed to comply with good manufacturing practices or other laws; (iii) transparency laws and related reporting and/or disclosures such as the Sunshine Act; and/or (iv) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that their provisions are open to a variety of evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nOur communications regarding products candidates, even while in development, are subject to extensive government scrutiny. We may be subject to governmental, regulatory and other legal proceedings relative to advertising, promotion, and marketing, and communications with study subjects and healthcare professionals, which could have a significant negative effect on our business.\nWe are subject to governmental oversight and associated civil and criminal enforcement relating to medical device advertising, promotion, and marketing, and such enforcement is evolving and intensifying. Communications regarding our products in development and regarding our clinical trials may subject us to enforcement if they do not comply with applicable laws. In the U.S., we are potentially subject to enforcement from the FDA, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. Other parties, including private plaintiffs, also are commonly bringing suit against pharmaceutical and medical device companies. We may be subject to liability based on the actions of individual employees and third-party contractors carrying out activities on our behalf.\nNon-compliance with laws and requirements unique to our government contracts could subject us to substantial penalties and financial exposure, and our business, operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by any non-compliance or the government\u2019s discretionary exercise of its rights under our government contracts.\nWe perform contracts awarded by federal governmental entities. Doing business in the public sector is very different than doing business in the commercial marketplace. For example, unlike commercial contracts, federal government contracts are governed by an array of statutes and regulations that define the way in which government contracts are conceived, structured, competed, awarded, performed, and ultimately completed. Due to the highly regulated nature of our business with the government, we have heightened responsibilities and compliance risks under those contracts. Non-compliance could result in significant civil liability and, in egregious cases, criminal prosecution.\nIn addition to presenting heightened compliance risks, our government contracts include terms that afford the government special rights that, if exercised at the government\u2019s discretion, could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition. For example, our sole source contract with the U.S. Army incorporates a clause allowing the government to terminate the contract for convenience of the government, in whole or in part, without any advance notice to us. A termination of this contract, or any other exercise of special governmental rights, could cause our business to suffer.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nIf our expenses are greater than anticipated, then we will have fewer funds with which to pursue our plan of operations and our financing requirements will be greater than anticipated.\nWe may find that the costs of carrying out our plan of operations are greater than we anticipate. Increased operating costs may cause the amount of financing that we require to increase. Investors may be more reluctant to provide additional financing if we cannot demonstrate that we can control our operating costs. There is no assurance that additional financing required as a result of our operating costs being greater than anticipated will be available to us. If we do not control our operating expenses, then we will have fewer funds with which to carry out our plan of operations with the result that our business may fail.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the ability and expertise of our Chief Executive Officer and a very limited number of employees and the loss of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe currently have a very small management team and very limited other employees. Our success is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith of our senior management, and in particular Philippe Deschamps, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Currently, Mr. Deschamps is joined by Joyce LaViscount, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, Jonathan Sackier, our Chief Medical Officer, and seven others as our only full-time employees. We also have engaged approximately 40 full-time equivalent persons as independent contractors. While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees. Any loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in a corporation\u2019s ownership may limit the amount of net operating losses, or NOLs, that can be utilized annually in the future to offset the corporation\u2019s (and the corporation\u2019s affiliates\u2019) U.S. federal and state taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within any three-year period. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the corporation that underwent the ownership change, immediately before the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect any limitation in future years (including by the way of exercising of warrants). We plan to undertake a study to analyze and determine if any historical ownership changes of us or our subsidiary NHC have occurred to determine if there are any permanent limitations on our ability to utilize NOLs in the future. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred, the limitations on the use of our NOLs could increase our U.S. federal and state tax liability and reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders or otherwise adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or warrants.\nWe may not be able to build an effective distribution network for our products.\nWe currently have very few employees and will likely need to rely on third party distributors to sell our product. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in entering into and maintaining productive arrangements with an adequate number of distributors that are sufficiently committed to selling our products. The establishment of a distribution network is expensive and time consuming. As we launch new products and increase our marketing effort with respect to existing products, we will need to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled independent distributors with significant technical knowledge. In addition, the commissions we pay our distributors could increase over time which would result in higher sales and marketing expenses. Furthermore, current and potential distributors may market and sell the products of our competitors. Even if the distributors market and sell our products, our competitors may be able, by\noffering higher commission payments or other incentives, to persuade these distributors to reduce or terminate their sales and marketing efforts related to our products. The distributors may also help competitors solicit business from our existing customers. Some of our independent distributors will likely account for a significant portion of our sales volume, and, if we were to lose them, our sales could be adversely affected. Even if we engage and maintain suitable relationships with an adequate number of distributors, they may not generate revenue as quickly as we expect them to, commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products, or ultimately succeed in selling our products.\nOutside of the United States, subject to approval by foreign regulatory authorities, we intend to evaluate the benefits of commercialization of the PoNS Therapy in certain territories either independently or with collaboration partners. For example, we intend to enter into a definitive exclusive license agreement with A&B to commercialize the PoNS device in certain Asian countries. However, to date, we have not entered into such a definitive agreement, and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so on commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nAs a result of the use of our product candidates in clinical trials, and if and when we sell our products, we may be liable for product liability claims and we may not carry sufficient product liability insurance.\nThe devices and products that we are developing may expose us to potential liability from personal injury claims by clinical trial subjects and, if commercially sold, end-users of the product. We maintain clinical trial liability insurance and intend to carry product liability insurance to protect us against the risk that in the future a product liability claim, or product recall could materially and adversely affect our business. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our intended products. We cannot assure you that if and when we commence distribution of our product that we will be able to obtain or maintain adequate coverage on acceptable terms, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims. Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could materially and adversely affect our reputation and prospects and divert management\u2019s time and attention. If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our future products our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. As an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and presenting the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and our financial performance. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Additionally, we have irrevocably elected to comply with new or revised accounting standards even though we are an emerging growth company.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years after our first sale of common stock pursuant to a Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, registration statement, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of our second quarter in any calendar year.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it. Because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have incurred increased costs and have become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of becoming a public company, which could lower our profits, if any, or make it more difficult to run our business.\nAs a public company, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We will continue to incur costs associated with the rules implemented by the SEC, the TSX, the OTCQB, and any other exchange on which our common stock may become listed. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have generally been increasing. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and\nofficer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nSeveral people who work for us on a part-time consulting basis may be subject to conflicts of interest.\nSeveral people who provide services to us are part-time consultants. Each may devote part of his working time to other business endeavors, including consulting relationships with other corporate entities, and may have responsibilities to these other entities. Because of these relationships, some of the persons who provide services to us may be subject to conflicts of interest. Such conflicts may include deciding how much time to devote to our affairs, as well as what business opportunities should be presented to us.\nWe have been the victim of a cyber-related crime and our controls may not be successful in avoiding further cyber-related crimes in the future.\nDuring the third quarter of, 2017, we were the victim of a business email compromise, fraud which resulted in our incurring a loss of approximately $0.2 million. We are working with law enforcement authorities and the banks involved in the wire transfer to pursue recovery of the $0.2 million, but at this time we do not know whether we will be able to recover any of the funds, and we have been advised that it may take several months before we are better able to evaluate our recovery prospects. Enhancements have been made to our controls relating to electronic payments by or for us that we believe will reduce our risk of becoming a victim of future frauds related to our payments, including by wire transfers. However, cyber-related criminal activities continue to evolve and increase in sophistication, frequency and severity. As a result, the control enhancements that have been made, and any additional enhancements that may be made in the future, to our controls may not be successful in avoiding our becoming a victim to further cyber-related crimes.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise any required working capital and adversely impact our operations.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise any required capital for our operations. Because our operations to date have been principally financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could have an adverse effect upon our liquidity and our continued operations. A reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future may have a material adverse effect upon our business plan and operations. If our stock price declines, we may not be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations.\nOur common stock does not have a well-established trading market in the United States. Trading of our common stock is sporadic, and the price of our common stock may be volatile; we caution you as to the highly illiquid nature of an investment in our shares.\nOur common stock is currently periodically quoted on the OTCQB electronic quotation service operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. A well-established market for our common stock may never develop in the United States. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance or the future prospect of our business. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of the shares.\nOur common stock has been listed on the TSX since April 18, 2016. Certain shares of our common stock are also restricted for immediate resale to U.S. persons or to anyone for the account or on behalf of any U.S. person, pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S. These shares are traded separately on the TSX under a separate ticker symbol. To date, trading on the TSX in our common stock has been extremely limited and sporadic.\nOur warrants were also approved for listing on the TSX on April 18, 2016. However, because only the warrants issued in the offshore offering in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act were approved for listing on the TSX, the warrants listed on the TSX may not be purchased by or on behalf of a U.S. person, or by a person in the United States, unless in a registered transaction or pursuant to an applicable safe harbor or exemption from registration.\nSecurities of microcap and small-cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the companies\u2019 financial performance or prospects. We believe that trading in our stock, if it occurs at all, will likely be subject to\nsignificant volatility since, among other reasons, we do not have nor, will we have in the foreseeable future an active trading market in our stock. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. Factors unrelated to our performance that may affect the price of our common stock include the following: the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow us, a reduction in trading volume and general market interest in our common stock may affect an investor\u2019s ability to trade significant numbers of shares of our common stock; the size of our public float may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our common stock; and a substantial decline in the price of shares of our common stock that persists for a significant period of time could cause our common stock, if listed on an exchange, to be delisted from such exchange, further reducing market liquidity. As a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common stock at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long-term value. The price of our common shares may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including: changes in financial estimates; our acquisitions and financings; quarterly variations in our operating results; the operating and share price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; and purchase or sale of blocks of our common stock. These factors, or any of them, may materially adversely affect the prices of our common shares regardless of our operating performance. We caution you as to the highly illiquid nature of an investment in our shares.\nThe market price of our common stock is affected by many other variables which are not directly related to our success and are, therefore, not within our control. These include other developments that affect the breadth of the public market for shares of our common stock and the attractiveness of alternative investments. The effect of these and other factors on the market price of our common stock is expected to make our common stock price volatile in the future, which may result in losses to investors.\nOur shares are subject to potential delisting if we do not meet or continue to maintain the listing requirements of the TSX.\nThe TSX rules for continued listing include minimum market capitalization and other requirements. Failure to maintain our listing on the TSX or being de-listed from the TSX would make it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of our common stock and more difficult to obtain accurate quotations on our common stock. This could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our ability to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future, may also be materially and adversely affected if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them, or at all.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;\n\u2022\nannouncements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u2022\nsignificant sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u2022\nvariations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of other comparable companies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles.\nIn the past, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. If a stockholder were to file any such class action suit against us, we would incur substantial legal fees and our management\u2019s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business to respond to the litigation, which could harm our business.\nWe are authorized to issue an unlimited number of Class A common stock, and we intend to issue significantly more shares to raise capital, which would result in substantial dilution to your investment in our shares.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of an unlimited number of Class A common shares that can be issued for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as are established by our board of directors without the approval of any of our shareholders. Any additional financings effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Moreover, the common stock issued in any such transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arm\u2019s-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional\nreduction in the percentage of common stock held by our current stockholders. Moreover, in connection with any such financing, we may be required to issue warrants to the investors, which could result in additional dilution. Our board of directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of common stock are issued in connection with a financing, dilution to the interests of our stockholders will occur and the rights of the holders of common stock might be materially and adversely affected. We may issue additional common shares in connection with a future financing or acquisition. The issuance of additional common shares may dilute an investor\u2019s investment in us and reduce cash available for distribution per common share, if any dividends are declared by the board of directors in the future.\nWe have not paid any dividends and do not foresee paying dividends in the future.\nWe intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be reviewed periodically by the board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, conditions then existing including earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business opportunities and other factors.\nA significant portion of our outstanding common stock may be sold into the public market in the future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur in the future. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares of our common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA, has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.\nAny future sales of our equity securities will dilute the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders and may decrease the market price for our common stock.\nFuture sales or issuances of equity securities could decrease the value of our common stock, dilute stockholders\u2019 voting power and reduce future potential earnings per share. We intend to sell additional equity securities in future offerings (including through the sale of securities convertible into shares of our common stock) and may issue additional equity securities to finance our operations, development, acquisitions or other projects. We cannot predict the size of future sales and issuances of equity securities or the effect, if any, that future sales and issuances of equity securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of equity securities, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. With any additional sale or issuance of equity securities, investors will suffer dilution of their voting power and may experience dilution in our earnings per share.\nAnti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nThough not now, we may be or in the future we may become subject to Wyoming\u2019s control share law. The law focuses on the acquisition of a \u201ccontrolling interest\u201d which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others. The effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share law. If control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder\u2019s shares.\nWyoming\u2019s control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation. In addition to the control share law, Wyoming has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Wyoming corporations and \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for three years after the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the corporation\u2019s board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Wyoming law, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term \u201cbusiness combination\u201d is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation\u2019s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders. The effect of Wyoming\u2019s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the Company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors.\nIn addition, our Articles of Incorporation provide for unlimited authorized shares of our Class A common stock. Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of unlimited authorized but unissued shares of common stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of our Class A common stock by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\nHolders of our Warrants will have no rights as shareholders until such holders exercise their Warrants and acquire our common shares.\nUntil holders of Warrants acquire common shares upon exercise of the Warrants, holders of Warrants will have no rights with respect to the common shares underlying such Warrants. Upon exercise of the Warrants, the holders thereof will be entitled to exercise the rights of common shareholders only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, significantly reforms the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to U.S. federal corporate income taxation, including reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks for net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and creating, modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Federal net operating losses arising in taxable year ending after December 31, 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely pursuant to the TCJA. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.", "PERMNO": 17690, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "HSDT"}
