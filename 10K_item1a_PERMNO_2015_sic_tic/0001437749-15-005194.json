{"cik": "879682", "company": "VIVEVE MEDICAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before purchasing shares of our common stock. There are numerous and varied risks that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are dependent upon the success of the Viveve System, which has a limited commercial history. If the Viveve System fails to gain or loses market acceptance, our business will suffer.\nIn 2012, we began marketing the Viveve System in Canada, Hong Kong and Japan, and we expect that sales of the Viveve System, including the single-use Viveve treatment tips, will account for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future. The Viveve System may not significantly penetrate current or new markets, including the U.S. and elsewhere. If demand for the Viveve System does not increase as we anticipate, or if demand declines, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nPerforming clinical studies on, and collecting data from, the Viveve Treatment is inherently subjective, and we have limited data regarding the efficacy of the Viveve System. If future data is not positive or consistent with our prior experience, rates of physician adoption will likely be harmed.\nWe believe that in order to significantly grow our business, we will need to conduct future clinical studies of the effectiveness of the Viveve System. Clinical studies of vaginal laxity and sexual function are subject to a number of limitations. First, these studies do not involve objective standards for measuring the effectiveness of treatment. Subjective, patient reported outcomes are the most common method of evaluating effectiveness. As a result, clinical studies may conclude that a treatment is effective even in the absence of objective measures. Second, as with other non-invasive, energy-based devices, the effect of the Viveve Treatment varies from patient to patient and can be influenced by a number of factors, including the age, ethnicity and level of vaginal laxity and sexual function of the patient among other things.\nCurrent published studies of the Viveve System conducted in the U.S. and Japan have investigated the tissue-tightening effect of Viveve\u2019s monopolar RF technology using single-arm studies where all patients enrolled in the trial received the same treatment without comparison to randomized, blinded or controlled trials. Clinical studies designed in a randomized, blinded and controlled fashion represent the gold-standard in clinical trial design, which most effectively assess the efficacy of a product or therapy versus a placebo group. Future clinical studies, which may be required to drive physician adoption or support regulatory clearance or approval, may require randomized, blinded and controlled trial designs. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated a new randomized, blinded and sham-controlled clinical trial in Europe and Canada designed to demonstrate the efficacy of the Viveve Treatment versus a sham controlled procedure for the treatment of vaginal introital laxity (the \u201cOUS Clinical Trials\u201d). (See discussion under the heading \u201cClinical Studies\u201d.) A sham controlled treatment or procedure refers to a procedure performed as a control and that is similar to the treatment or procedure under investigation without the key therapeutic element being investigated.\nSince we have not yet received the results of the Viveve Treatment under these trial design conditions, we cannot be certain that the outcomes will be positive. Negative outcomes would have a material, adverse impact on our business. For example, on September 30, 2014, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended on February 19, 2015, with Square 1 Bank (the \"Lender\") pursuant to which we received a term loan in the amount of $5 million, which is anticipated to be funded in 3 tranches. The first tranche of $2.5 million was provided to us on October 1, 2014. The second tranche of the term loan is equal to $1.5 million, of which $500,000 was provided to us on February 19, 2015 and $1 million is subject to (i) evidence acceptable to the Lender of at least 50% enrollment in the OUS Clinical Trial no later than March 9, 2015 and (ii) documentation or other evidence acceptable to the Lender of a prospective equity financing to close by April 15, 2015. In addition, before the third tranche of $1 million of the term loan will be funded, we must achieve positive interim 3-month results relating to our OUS Clinical Trials ending on June 30, 2015. On March 16, 2015, we have received an additional $500,000 in connection with a drawdown of funds from the second tranche. The failure to satisfy the conditions to draw down on the third tranche of the term loan, and an inability to renegotiate the terms of the loan with the lender to permit a drawdown of the funds when such conditions are satisfied could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its operations.\nAdditionally, we have not conducted any head-to-head clinical studies that compare results from treatment with the Viveve System to surgery or treatment with other therapies. Without head-to-head studies against competing alternative treatments, which we have no current plans to conduct, potential customers may not find clinical studies of our technology sufficiently compelling to purchase the Viveve System. If we decide to pursue additional studies in the future, such studies could be expensive and time consuming, and the data collected may not produce favorable or compelling results. If the results of such studies do not meet physicians\u2019 expectations, the Viveve System may not become widely adopted, physicians may recommend alternative treatments for their patients, and our business may be harmed.\nWe currently do not have the ability to market the Viveve System in the U.S. If we want to sell the Viveve System and single-use treatment tips in the U.S., we will need to obtain FDA clearance or approval, which may not be granted.\nDeveloping and promoting the Viveve System in additional areas, including the U.S., is a key element of our future growth strategy. We currently do not have U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance or approval in the U.S. to market the Viveve System. We are in the process of seeking clearance or approval from the FDA to expand our marketing efforts. We cannot predict whether we will receive such clearances or approvals. The FDA will require us to conduct clinical trials to support regulatory clearance or approval, which trials may be time-consuming and expensive, and may produce results that do not result in clearance or approval of our FDA application. In the event that we do not obtain FDA clearance or approval, we will be unable to promote the Viveve System in the U.S. and the ability to grow our revenues may be adversely affected.\nOur business is not currently profitable, and we may not be able to achieve profitability even if we are able to generate significant revenue.\nThrough December 31, 2014, we incurred losses since inception of approximately $36.1 million. In 2014, we incurred a loss of $6.2 million and in 2013 a loss of $4.3 million. Despite increasing revenue, we expect to incur significant additional losses while we grow and expand our business. We cannot predict if and when we will achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and may require us to seek additional financing for our business. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional financing or that any such financing will be on terms that are favorable to us.\nIt is difficult to forecast future performance, which may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to predict future performance. Additionally, the demand for the Viveve System may vary from quarter to quarter. A number of factors, over which we have limited or no control, may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results, such as:\n\u25cf\ndelays in receipt of anticipated purchase orders;\n\u25cf\nperformance of our independent distributors;\n\u25cf\npositive or negative media coverage of the Viveve System, the Viveve Treatment or products of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain further regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u25cf\ndelays in, or failure of, product and component deliveries by our subcontractors and suppliers;\n\u25cf\ncustomer response to the introduction of new product offerings; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in foreign currency.\nOur limited operating history has limited our ability to determine an appropriate sales price for our products.\nOur historical operating performance has limited our ability to determine the proper sales prices for the Viveve System and the single-use treatment tips. Establishing appropriate pricing for our capital equipment and components has been challenging because there have not existed directly comparable competitive products. We may experience similar pricing challenges in the future as we enter new markets or introduce new products, which could have an unanticipated negative impact on our financial performance.\nIf there is not sufficient patient demand for our treatments, practitioner demand for the Viveve System could drop, resulting in unfavorable operating results.\nMost procedures performed using the Viveve System are elective procedures, the cost of which must be borne by the patient, and are not reimbursable through government or private health insurance. The decision to undergo the Viveve Treatment is thus driven by consumer demand, which may be influenced by a number of factors, such as:\n\u25cf\nour sales and marketing efforts directed toward consumers, for which we have limited experience and resources;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which physicians recommend the Viveve Treatment to their patients;\n\u25cf\nthe cost, safety and effectiveness of a Viveve Treatment versus alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\ngeneral consumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of such procedures; and\n\u25cf\nconsumer confidence, which may be impacted by economic and political conditions.\nOur financial performance could be materially harmed in the event that any of the above factors discourage patients from seeking the Viveve Treatment.\nThe failure of the Viveve System to meet patient expectations or the occurrence of unpleasant side effects from the Viveve Treatment could impair our financial performance.\nOur future success depends upon patients having a positive experience with the Viveve Treatment in order to increase physician demand for our products, as a result of positive feedback and word-of-mouth referrals. Patients may be dissatisfied if their expectations of the procedure, side effects and results, among other things, are not met. Despite the safety of the Viveve Treatment, patients may experience undesirable side-effects such as temporary swelling or reddening of the treated tissue. Experiencing any of these side effects could discourage a patient from completing a Viveve Treatment or discourage a patient from having future procedures or referring Viveve Treatments to others. In order to generate referral business, we believe that patients must be satisfied with the effectiveness of the Viveve Treatment. Results obtained from a Viveve Treatment are subjective and may be subtle. The Viveve Treatment may produce results that may not meet patients\u2019 expectations. If patients are not satisfied with the procedure or feel that it is too expensive for the results obtained, our reputation and future sales will suffer.\nOur success depends on growing physician adoption of the Viveve System and continued use of treatment tips.\nSome of our target physician customers already own self-pay device products. Our ability to grow our business and convince physicians to purchase the Viveve System depends on the success of our sales and marketing efforts. Our business model involves both a capital equipment purchase of the Viveve System and continued purchases by our customers of single-use treatment tips and ancillary consumables. This may be a novel business model for many potential customers who may be used to competing products that are exclusively capital equipment, such as many laser-based systems. We must be able to demonstrate that the cost of the Viveve System and the revenue that the physician can derive from performing procedures using it are compelling when compared to the cost and revenue associated with alternative products or therapies. When marketing to plastic surgeons, we must also, in some cases, overcome a bias against non-invasive procedures. If we are unable to increase physician adoption of the Viveve System and use of the treatment tips, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nTo successfully market and sell the Viveve System internationally, we must address many issues with which we have limited experience.\nSales outside the U.S. accounted for 100% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. We believe that a significant portion of our business will continue to come from sales outside the U.S. through increased penetration in countries where we currently sell the Viveve System, combined with expansion into new international markets. However, international sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in penetrating markets in which our competitors\u2019 products may be more established;\n\u25cf\nreduced or no protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf\nexport restrictions, trade regulations and foreign tax laws;\n\u25cf\nfluctuating foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\nforeign certification and regulatory clearance or approval requirements;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in developing effective marketing campaigns for unfamiliar, foreign countries;\n\u25cf\ncustoms clearance and shipping delays;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability; and\n\u25cf\npreference for locally produced products.\nIf one or more of these risks were realized, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy the situation, and even if we are able to find a solution, our revenues may still decline.\nTo market and sell the Viveve System internationally, we depend on distributors, and they may not be successful.\nWe currently depend exclusively on third-party distributors to sell and service the Viveve System internationally and to train our international customers, and if these distributors terminate their relationships with us or under-perform, we may be unable to maintain or increase our level of international revenue. We will also need to engage additional international distributors to grow our business and expand the territories in which we sell the Viveve System. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market, sell and service the Viveve System to the level of our expectations. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to engage distributors in particular geographic areas, our revenue from international operations will be adversely affected.\nWe currently have limited sales and marketing resources or experience and failure to build and manage a sales force or to market and distribute the Viveve System effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect to rely on a direct sales force to sell the Viveve System in the U.S. In order to meet our future anticipated sales objectives, we expect to grow our domestic sales organization significantly over the next several years. There are significant risks involved in building and managing our sales organization, including risks related to our ability to:\n\u25cf hire qualified individuals as needed;\n\u25cf\nprovide adequate training for the effective sale of the Viveve System; and\n\u25cf\nretain and motivate sales employees.\nIn addition, the Viveve System competes with products that are well-established in the market. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict how well our sales force will perform. Our failure to adequately address these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell the Viveve System, causing our revenue to be lower than expected and harming our results of operations.\nWe compete against companies that have more established products, longer operating histories and greater resources, which may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration or increased operating results.\nThe medical device and aesthetics markets are highly competitive and dynamic, and are marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Demand for the Viveve System could be diminished by equivalent or superior products and technologies offered by competitors. Specifically, the Viveve System competes against other offerings in these markets, including laser and other light-based medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer products, surgical procedures and exercise therapies.\nCompeting in these markets could result in price-cutting, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and the Viveve System from our competitors and their products, on such factors as:\n\u25cf\nsafety and effectiveness;\n\u25cf\nproduct pricing;\n\u25cf\nsuccess of our marketing initiatives;\n\u25cf\ncompelling clinical data;\n\u25cf\nintellectual property protection;\n\u25cf\nquality of customer support; and\n\u25cf\ndevelopment of successful distribution channels, both domestically and internationally.\nSome of our competitors have more established products and customer relationships than we have, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. For example, we may encounter situations where, due to pre-existing relationships, potential customers decide to purchase additional products from our competitors. Potential customers also may need to recoup the cost of expensive products that they have already purchased from our competitors and thus may decide not to purchase, or to delay the purchase of, the Viveve System. If we are unable to achieve continued market penetration, we will be unable to compete effectively and our business will be harmed.\nIn addition, some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, research and development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing resources than we have. Our competitors could utilize their greater financial resources to acquire other companies to gain enhanced name recognition and market share, as well as new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing product. Given the relatively few competitors currently in the market, any such action could exacerbate existing competitive pressures, which could harm our business.\nCompetition among providers of devices for the medical device and aesthetics markets is characterized by rapid innovation, and we must continuously innovate the Viveve System and develop new products or our revenue may decline.\nWhile we attempt to protect the Viveve System through patents and other intellectual property rights, there are few barriers to entry that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that compete directly with our products. For example, while we believe our monopolar RF technology maintains a strong intellectual property position, there may be other companies employing competing technologies which claim to have a similar clinical effect to our technology. Additionally, there are others who may market monopolar RF technology for competing purposes in a direct challenge to our intellectual property position. As we continue to create market demand for a non-surgical, non-invasive way to treat vaginal laxity and sexual dysfunction, competitors may enter the market with other products making similar or superior claims. We expect that any competitive advantage we may enjoy from our current and future innovations may diminish over time, as companies successfully respond to our innovations, or create their own. Consequently, we believe that we will have to continuously innovate and improve the Viveve System and technology or develop new products to compete successfully. If we are unable to develop new products or innovate successfully, the Viveve System could become obsolete and our revenue will decline as our customers purchase competing products.\nWe outsource the manufacturing and repair of key elements of the Viveve System to a single manufacturing partner.\nWe outsource the manufacture and repair of the Viveve System to a single contract manufacturer, Stellartech Research Corporation. If Stellartech\u2019s operations are interrupted or if Stellartech is unable to meet our delivery requirements due to capacity limitations or other constraints, we may be limited in our ability to fulfill new customer orders or to repair equipment at current customer sites. Stellartech has limited manufacturing capacity, is itself dependent upon third-party suppliers and is dependent on trained technical labor to effectively repair components making up the Viveve System. In addition, Stellartech is a medical device manufacturer and is required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR. If Stellartech fails to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, its manufacturing and repair operations could be halted. In addition, both the availability of our product to support the fulfillment of new customer orders as well as our ability to repair those products installed at current customer sites would be impaired. In addition, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the development and manufacturing agreement under which Viveve and Stellartech operate has expired without any subsequent extension or renewal by the parties and the minimum conditions to the licenses granted therein have not been satisfied by us. Although the parties continue to operate under the terms of this agreement, our manufacturing operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to enforce Stellartech\u2019s performance under this agreement, or enter into a new agreement with Stellartech upon favorable terms.\nOur manufacturing operations and those of our key manufacturing subcontractors are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nThe single source supply of the Viveve System from Stellartech could not be replaced without significant effort and delay in production. Also, several other components and materials that comprise the Viveve System are currently manufactured by a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. In many of these cases, we have not yet qualified alternate suppliers and we rely upon purchase orders, rather than long-term supply agreements. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current suppliers\u2019 capabilities could harm our ability to manufacture the Viveve System until new sources of supply are identified and qualified. Our reliance on these suppliers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf\ninterruption of supply resulting from modifications to or discontinuation of a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u25cf\ndelays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier\u2019s variation in a component;\n\u25cf\na lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner, or to obtain adequate supply on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our components in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nproduction delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers, and corresponding regulatory qualifications;\n\u25cf\ndelay in delivery due to suppliers prioritizing other customer orders over our orders;\n\u25cf\ndamage to our brand reputation caused by defective components produced by our suppliers;\n\u25cf\nincreased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement based upon defects in components produced by our suppliers; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuation in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or from their other customers.\nAny interruption in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain substitute components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf, in the future, we decide to perform additional manufacturing functions internally that we currently outsource, our business could be harmed by our limited manufacturing experience and related capabilities.\nIn the future, for financial or operational purposes, we may elect to perform component or system manufacturing functions internally. Our limited experience with manufacturing processes could lead to difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of manufactured items that meet our quality standards and that comply with applicable regulatory requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition, if we experience these types of manufacturing difficulties, it may be expensive and time consuming to engage a new or previous subcontractor or supplier to fulfill our replacement manufacturing needs. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business.\nIf the Viveve System malfunctions or if we discover a manufacturing defect that could lead to a malfunction, we may have to initiate a product recall or replace components, which could adversely impact our business.\nProblems in our manufacturing processes, or those of our manufacturing partners or subcontractors, which lead to an actual or possible malfunction in any of the components of the Viveve System, may require us to recall product from customers or replace components and could disrupt our operations. For example, in December 2012, we began replacing handpiece assemblies that were causing system malfunctions due to fiber optic damage that occurred during the manufacturing process. We subsequently worked with our manufacturing partner to redesign and test the reliability of the newly designed handpiece. The problem was resolved within several weeks and did not have a significant impact on our ability to supply products to our customers or, more generally, on our results of operations. However, our results of operations, reputation and market acceptance of our products could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in manufacturing that result in a more significant issue or significant patient injury, and delays our ability to fill customer orders.\nWe may not be able to develop an alternative cooling module that will be in compliance with changing environmental regulations in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur cooling module relies upon a hydroflurocarbon, or HFC, called R134a, to protect the outer layer of the tissue from over-heating while the device delivers RF energy to the submucosal tissue. New environmental regulations phasing out HFCs over the next decade have been adopted or are under consideration in a number of countries, and since 2007, European Union directives, aimed at the automotive industry, require the phase-out of HFCs and prohibit the introduction of new products incorporating HFCs and it is currently anticipated that such directives may impact the medical device industry. As a result, if we are unable to develop an alternative cooling module for our device which is not dependent on HFCs in a timely or cost-effective manner, the Viveve System may not be in compliance with environmental regulations, which could result in fines, civil penalties and the inability to sell our products in certain major international markets.\nIn addition, the impending restrictions on HFCs have reduced their current availability, as suppliers have lower incentive to expand production capacity or maintain existing capacity. This change in supply could expose us to supply shortages or increased prices for R134a, which could impair our ability to manufacture the Viveve System and adversely affect our results or operations. HFCs may also be classified by some countries as a hazardous substance and subject to significant shipping surcharges that may negatively impact profit margins.\nWe forecast sales to determine requirements for components and materials used in the Viveve System, and if our forecasts are incorrect, we may experience delays in shipments or increased inventory costs.\nWe keep limited materials, components and finished product on hand. To manage our manufacturing operations with our suppliers, we forecast anticipated product orders and material requirements to predict our inventory needs up to six months in advance and enter into purchase orders on the basis of these requirements. Our limited historical experience may not provide us with enough data to accurately predict future demand. If our business expands, our demand for components and materials would increase and our suppliers may be unable to meet our demand. If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we will have excess inventory, which would increase our expenses. If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt, delay or prevent delivery of the Viveve System to our customers. Any of these occurrences would negatively affect our financial performance and the level of satisfaction that our customers have with our business.\nEven though we require training for users of the Viveve System and we do not sell the Viveve System to non-physicians, there exists a potential for misuse, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nOutside of the U.S., our independent distributors sell in many jurisdictions that do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of the Viveve System. We do not supervise the procedures performed with the Viveve System, nor can we be assured that direct physician supervision of our equipment occurs according to our recommendations. We and our distributors require purchasers of the Viveve System to undergo an initial training session as a condition of purchase, but do not require ongoing training. In addition, we prohibit the sale of the Viveve System to companies that rent the Viveve System to third parties, but we cannot prevent an otherwise qualified physician from contracting with a rental company in violation of his or her purchase agreement with us.\nIn the U.S., we intend to only sell the Viveve System to licensed physicians who have met certain training requirements. However, current Federal regulations will allow us to sell the Viveve System to \u201clicensed practitioners,\u201d once we receive FDA approval. The definition of \u201clicensed practitioners\u201d varies from state to state. As a result, the Viveve System may be operated by licensed practitioners with varying levels of training, and in many states by non-physicians, including physician assistants, registered nurses and nurse practitioners. Thus, in some states, the definition of \u201clicensed practitioner\u201d may result in the legal use of the Viveve System by non-physicians.\nThe use of the Viveve System by non-physicians, as well as noncompliance with the operating guidelines set forth in our training programs, may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation.\nProduct liability suits could be brought against us due to defective design, labeling, material or workmanship, or misuse of the Viveve System, and could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates.\nIf the Viveve System is defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contains defective components or is misused, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Misusing the Viveve System or failing to adhere to operating guidelines could cause serious adverse events. In addition, if our operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, we may be subject to liability. We may, in the future, be involved in litigation related to the use of the Viveve System. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. We may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and reduce product sales. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our operating results.\nAfter-market modifications to treatment tips by third parties and the development of counterfeit products could reduce our sales, expose us to product liability litigation and dilute our brand quality.\nThird parties may introduce adulterated after-market modifications to our treatment tips, which enable re-use of treatment tips in multiple procedures. Because the treatment tips are designed to withstand a finite number of pulses, modifications intended to increase the number of pulses could result in patient injuries caused by the use of worn-out or damaged treatment tips. In addition, third parties may seek to develop counterfeit products that are compatible with the Viveve System and available to practitioners at lower prices. If security features incorporated into the design of the Viveve System are unable to prevent after-market modifications to the treatment tips or the introduction of counterfeit products, we could be subject to reduced sales, product liability lawsuits resulting from the use of damaged or defective goods and damage to our reputation.\nWe depend on skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business effectively. If we are unable to recruit, hire and retain these employees, our ability to manage and expand our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees. While we have employment contracts with our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, these officers and other key employees may terminate their employment at any time. The loss of any senior management team members could weaken our management expertise and harm our business.\nOur ability to retain our skilled labor force and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future. We may not be able to meet our future hiring needs or retain existing personnel. We will face particularly significant challenges and risks in hiring, training, managing and retaining engineering and sales and marketing employees, as well as independent distributors, most of whom are geographically dispersed and must be trained in the use and benefits of the Viveve System. Failure to attract and retain personnel, particularly technical and sales and marketing personnel, would materially harm our ability to compete effectively and grow our business.\nAny acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe expect to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. We may also consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate acquisitions of any businesses, products or technologies. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition and management of any collaborative project may divert management\u2019s time and resources from our business and disrupt our operations. We do not have any experience with acquiring companies or products. If we decide to expand our product offerings, we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory qualifications or approvals for our current or future products, which could harm our business.\nSales of the Viveve System internationally are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the U.S. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain clearances or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approvals, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may rely on third-party distributors to obtain all regulatory clearances and approvals required in other countries, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such clearances or approvals. Our distributors may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or qualifications, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If our distributors experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our products outside the U.S., or if they fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products outside of the U.S., we may be subject to rigorous international regulation in the future. In these circumstances, we would be required to rely on our foreign independent distributors to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our product in foreign countries.\nIf we fail to maintain regulatory approvals and clearances, or if we are unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for the Viveve System or any future products we may develop or acquire, including product enhancements, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Viveve System is, and any future products we may acquire or develop will be, subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, approval of a de novo reclassification petition, or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application, or PMA, unless the device is specifically exempt from those requirements. The FDA will clear marketing of a lower risk medical device through the 510(k) process if the manufacturer demonstrates that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products. High risk devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, require the approval of a PMA. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use.\nIf there is no known predicate for a device, a company can request a de novo reclassification of the product. De novo generally applies where there is no predicate device and the FDA believes the device is sufficiently safe so that no PMA should be required. FDA\u2019s de novo process has just been streamlined to allow a company to request that a new product classification be developed based on information provided by the requesting company. Our plan is to utilize the Direct De Novo process for the Viveve System. However, we cannot predict when or if such approval will be obtained, or whether FDA will create a new product code. Failure to approve the de novo petition, or establishment of a new product code could require us to seek a PMA for the Viveve System. Delays in receipt or failure to receive clearances or approvals could reduce our sales, profitability and future growth prospects.\nIf we modify an FDA-cleared device, we may need to seek and obtain new clearances, which, if not granted, would prevent the sale of our modified product or require us to redesign the product.\nAny modifications to an FDA-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket approval. Viveve may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing product in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn could harm our revenue and potential future profitability. We have made modifications to our device in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified device, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign the product.\nClinical trials necessary to support a 510(k) or a PMA application will be expensive and will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients. Suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials will prevent us from commercializing any modified or new products and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe FDA has asked us to conduct an investigational device exemption, or IDE, study to support a future product submission for the Viveve System. Initiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support a 510(k) or a PMA application for the Viveve System, as well as other possible future product candidates, will be time consuming and expensive and the outcome is uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical studies will require the enrollment of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators, support staff, and proximity of patients to clinical sites and ability to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our product or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risk or discomfort.\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our product or result in the failure of the clinical trial. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in clinical trials, the FDA may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain the regulatory clearance or approval which would permit us to commercialize our products.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the pre-clinical and clinical trials for our product, therefore we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct the trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or be able to successfully commercialize, our product on a timely basis, if at all. In that event, our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our proposed product claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects. Furthermore, if the results of our OUS Clinical Trials are not positive, we may not receive further funding from our lender. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, it cannot be certain that the results of the clinical trials will support our proposed claims for the Viveve System, that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding them or that even if our product receives regulatory approval or clearance, that it will not later result in adverse side effects that limit or prevent its use. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses. Any delay of our clinical trials or failure by the FDA or other foreign authorities to support our product claims will delay, or even prevent, our ability to commercialize our product and generate revenues. Furthermore, additional funding of up to an aggregate of $1 million committed to the Company is contingent upon our meeting certain enrollment milestones and achieving certain positive results relating to our OUS Clinical Trials. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEven if our product is approved by regulatory authorities, if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product, the product could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies, such as the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services, or CDHS. In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, and International Standards Organization, or ISO, regulations for the manufacture of our product and other regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval. Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, enforce the QSR and other regulations through periodic inspections. In the past, our facility has been inspected by the FDA and CDHS, and observations were noted. The FDA and CDHS have accepted our responses to these observations, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the QSR. Any future failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u25cf\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions\n\u25cf\ncustomer notifications for repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u25cf\nrecall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u25cf\noperating restrictions;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances on PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to grant export approval for our product; or\n\u25cf\ncriminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our third party manufacturers may not currently be, or may not continue to be, in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result in a failure to produce our product on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nEven if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted for the Viveve System or future products, such clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe Viveve System may also be subject to state regulations which are, in many instances, in flux. Changes in state regulations may impede sales. For example, federal regulations may allow the Viveve System to be sold to, or on the order of, \u201clicensed practitioners,\u201d as determined on a state-by-state basis. As a result, in some states, non-physicians may legally purchase and operate the Viveve System. However, a state could change its regulations at any time, disallowing sales to particular types of end users. We cannot predict the impact or effect of future legislation or regulations at the federal or state levels.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, our business would suffer.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our product. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections. We anticipate that in the future we will be subject to such inspections. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our product, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, which would cause our reputation, sales and business to suffer.\nIf our product causes or contributes to a death or a serious injury, or malfunctions in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving the Viveve System or future products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as mounting a defense to a legal action, if one were to be brought, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nThe Viveve System may, in the future, be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our product in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. A recall of our product would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. In the future, we may initiate one or more voluntary recalls involving our product that we determine do not require notification to the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nFederal and state regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our product profitably.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a medical device. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFor example, in August 2010, the FDA issued its preliminary recommendations on reform of the 510(k) premarket notification process for medical devices. On January 19, 2011, the FDA announced its \u201cPlan of Action\u201d for implementing these recommendations. The Plan of Action included 25 action items, including revising existing guidance or developing guidance to clarify various aspects of the 510(k) process and to streamline the review process for innovative, lower risk products (the \u201cde novo\u201d process); improving training for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health staff; increasing reliance on external experts; and addressing and improving internal processes. The FDA has already begun implementing many of these reforms, and may implement other reforms in the future. Future reforms could have the effect of making it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain 510(k) clearance.\nIn addition, a state could change its regulations at any time, disallowing sales to particular types of end users. We cannot predict the impact or effect of future legislation or regulations at the federal or state levels.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the U.S. could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nA significant portion of our revenues is and will be from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of directing, obtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA applies to companies and individuals alike, including company directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. In addition, the government may seek to rely on a theory of successor liability and hold us responsible for FCPA violations committed by companies or associated with assets which we acquire.\nIn many foreign countries where we operate, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other similar laws and regulations. In contrast, we have implemented a company policy requiring our employees and consultants to comply with the FCPA and similar laws. Although we have not conducted formal FCPA compliance training, we are in the process of devising a training schedule for certain of our employees, agents and partners. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that our employees, partners and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of the FCPA or our policies for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As a result of our anticipated growth, our development of infrastructure designed to identify FCPA matters and monitor compliance is at an early stage. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and financial conditions. We may also face collateral consequences, such as debarment and the loss of our export privileges.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection for the Viveve System, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and the Viveve System. We have an exclusive license to 8 issued U.S. patents primarily covering the Viveve System and methods of use, the earliest of which expire in 2015 and the latest of which expires in 2017; 3 pending U.S. patent applications, 12 issued foreign patents and 17 pending foreign patent applications, some of which foreign applications preserve an opportunity to pursue patent rights in multiple countries. Some of the Viveve System components are not, and in the future may not be, protected by patents. Additionally, our patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Any patents we obtain may be challenged, invalidated or legally circumvented by third parties. Consequently, competitors could market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. Moreover, we do not have patent rights in all foreign countries in which a market may exist, and where we have applied for foreign patent rights, the laws of many foreign countries will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nIn addition, competitors could purchase the Viveve System and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected so as to defend our market against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position and business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be involved in future costly intellectual property litigation, which could impact our future business and financial performance.\nOur industry has been characterized by frequent intellectual property litigation. Our competitors or other patent holders may assert that the Viveve System and the methods we employ are covered by their patents. If the Viveve System or methods are found to infringe, we could be prevented from marketing the Viveve System. In addition, we do not know whether our competitors or potential competitors have applied for, or will apply for or obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, import or export the Viveve System. We may also initiate litigation against third parties to protect our intellectual property that may be expensive, protracted or unsuccessful. In the future there may be companies that market products for competing purposes in direct challenge to our intellectual property position, and we may be required to initiate litigation in order to stop them. If we initiate litigation to protect our rights, we run the risk of having our patents invalidated, which would undermine our competitive position.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to the Viveve System, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In that event, we do not know whether necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, or whether we could redesign the Viveve System or processes to avoid infringement.\nCompeting products may also appear in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, we could be prevented from marketing the Viveve System in one or more countries.\nIn addition, we may hereafter become involved in litigation to protect our trademark rights associated with our name or the names used with the Viveve System. Names used with the Viveve System and procedures may be claimed to infringe names held by others or to be ineligible for proprietary protection. If we have to change the name of the company or the Viveve System, we may experience a loss in goodwill associated with our brand name, customer confusion and a loss of sales.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the Commission have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, these rules and regulations increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time consuming and costly. As a public company, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to maintain our director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, and to maintain insurance at reasonable rates, or at all.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are significantly more stringent than those required of us prior to the Merger. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that are applicable to us as a result of the Merger. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our common stock.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nSince the Merger was consummated, 5AM Ventures II (in conjunction with 5AM Co-Investors II), and GBS Venture Partners Limited, both of whom were equity and convertible debenture holders of Viveve, Inc., together own approximately 58.4% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own and we depend on cash flow from Viveve, Inc. to meet our obligations.\nAs a result of the Merger, we are a holding company with no business operations of our own or material assets other than the stock we own in Viveve, Inc. All of our operations are conducted by Viveve, Inc. As a holding company, we will require dividends and other payments from our subsidiary to meet cash requirements. The terms of any agreements governing indebtedness that we may enter into may restrict our subsidiary from paying dividends and otherwise transferring cash or other assets to us. If there is an insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of our subsidiary, our stockholders likely will have no right to proceed against its assets. Creditors of our subsidiary will be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of our subsidiary before we, as an equity holder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from that sale or disposal. If Viveve, Inc. is unable to pay dividends or make other payments to us when needed, we will be unable to satisfy our obligations.\nBecause we are incorporated in Canada, you may not be able to enforce judgments against us and our Canadian directors.\nUnder Canadian law, you may not be able to enforce a judgment issued by courts in the U.S. against us or our Canadian directors. The status of the law in Canada is unclear as to whether a U.S. citizen can enforce a judgment from a U.S. court in Canada for violations of U.S. securities laws. A separate suit may need to be brought directly in Canada.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u25cf\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our business, the market for our products, the health services industry, or the healthcare and health insurance industries in general;\n\u25cf\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nour ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u25cf\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, fluctuations in interest rates and international currency fluctuations.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded, the price may not reflect our value, and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded, our common stock is available to be traded and is held by a small number of holders, and the price may not reflect our actual or perceived value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business, among other things. We will take certain steps including utilizing investor awareness campaigns, investor relations firms, press releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business. Any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require that we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business, and trading may be at an inflated price relative to the performance of the Company due to, among other things, the availability of sellers of our shares. If an active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there is currently a relatively low per-share price for our common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms are not willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares for deposit in an account. Many lending institutions will not permit the use of low priced shares of common stock as collateral for any loans.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, or shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d and, in anticipation of which, the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nIn general, under Rule 144, a non-affiliated person who has held restricted shares of our common stock for a period of six months may sell into the market all of their shares, subject to the Company being current in our periodic reports filed with the Commission. As of March 10, 2015, approximately 1,355,269 shares of common stock of the 18,341,294 shares issued and outstanding were free trading.\nIn addition, as of March 10, 2015, there were 2,399,443 shares subject to outstanding warrants, 2,291,783 shares subject to outstanding options and an additional 841,739 shares reserved for future issuance under our 2013 Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended, that will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any earnings to develop, carry on, and expand our business.\nPenny stock rules may make buying or selling our common stock difficult, and severely limit its marketability and liquidity.\nBecause our securities are considered a penny stock, stockholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their shares. The Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. Because our securities constitute \u201cpenny stocks\u201d within the meaning of the rules, the rules apply to us and to our securities. The rules may further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them.
