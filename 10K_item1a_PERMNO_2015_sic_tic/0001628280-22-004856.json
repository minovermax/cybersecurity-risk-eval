{"cik": "855874", "company": "COMMUNITY FINANCIAL CORP /MD/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to limit its spread could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted economic and commercial activity and financial markets. Measures to contain the virus, such as stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, closure of non-essential businesses, occupancy limitations and social distancing requirements, resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, and mass layoffs and furloughs. Though most restrictions have been lifted or eased and consumer and business spending and unemployment levels have improved significantly, the economic recovery has been uneven, with industries such as travel, entertainment, hospitality and food service lagging, and, as of December 31, 2021, many companies have not returned workers to their offices. Supply chain disruptions precipitated by the abrupt economic slowdown have contributed to increased costs, lost revenue, and inflationary pressures for many segments of the economy. Further, a significant number of workers left their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to wage inflation in many industries as businesses attempt to fill vacant positions.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately affect our business is unknown and will depend, among other things, on the duration of the pandemic, the actions undertaken by national, state and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or mitigate its effects, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines that have been developed and the extent to which they are accepted by the public, the development of effective therapies, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume.\nThe continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to contain the virus, including effects of economic stimulus, and the exhaustion or expiration of stimulus benefits, could:\n\u2022reduce the demand for loans and other financial services;\n\u2022result in increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures;\n\u2022cause the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, to decline in value;\n\u2022reduce the availability and productivity of our employees;\n\u2022cause our vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing obligations to us;\n\u2022negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers that perform critical services for our business;\n\u2022cause the value of our securities portfolio to decline; and\n\u2022cause the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors to decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nAny one or a combination of the above events could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreased credit risk resultant of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our profitability.\nWe are exposed to the risk that loans will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient. We are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. Material economic disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused and may cause our borrowers to have difficulties in repaying their loans. Governmental actions providing payment relief to borrowers affected by COVID-19 could preclude our ability to initiate foreclosure proceedings and, as a result, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of our nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for loan losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of certain commercial real estate and multifamily residential loans include the duration of state and local moratoriums on evictions for non-payment of rent or other fees. The payment on these loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate property and may subject us to risks from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.\nBank regulatory agencies and various governmental authorities are urging financial institutions to work with borrowers who are unable to meet their payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. We have been working to support our borrowers to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on them and on our loan portfolio, including through loan modifications that defer payments for those who experienced a hardship as a result of COVID-19. Although regulatory guidance provides that such loan modifications are exempt from the calculation and reporting of troubled debt restructurings and loan delinquencies, we cannot predict whether such loan modifications may ultimately have an adverse impact on our profitability in future periods. Our inability to successfully manage the increased credit risk caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rate volatility stemming from COVID-19 could negatively affect our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability.\nOur net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. In March 2020, the FRB lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and expense and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may experience losses, additional expense and reputational harm arising out of our origination of PPP loans.\nWe originated $201.3 million of PPP loans to over 1,532 borrowers. The vast majority of our PPP loans were made to existing borrowers or deposit customers, and we have not recorded an allowance for loan losses on these loans due to the guarantee of the SBA. We may incur losses on some of our PPP loans if the loans are not forgiven, the borrowers default and the SBA does not honor its guarantee due to an error made by us in making the loan. In addition, we may experience reputational harm arising out of our origination of PPP loans due to reports of borrower fraud, concerns about whether small businesses sufficiently benefited from the program, and government administration of the loan forgiveness process. Further, there have been lawsuits against other banks alleging that various PPP lenders improperly prioritized existing customers when those lenders approved PPP loans and that various PPP lenders failed to pay required agency fees to third parties who allegedly assisted businesses with PPP loan applications. We may experience additional expense and reputational harm arising out of our origination of PPP loans if we become subject to a similar lawsuit.\nCredit Risks\nOur increased emphasis on commercial lending may expose us to increased credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, our loan portfolio included $1,115.5 million, or 70.7%, and $1,049.1 million, or 69.8%, respectively, of commercial real estate loans, $195.0 million, or 12.4%, and $139.1 million, or 9.2%, respectively, of residential rental loans, $50.6 million, or 3.2% and $52.9 million, or 3.5%, respectively of commercial business loans and $62.5 million, or 4.0% and $61.7 million, or 4.1%, respectively, of commercial equipment loans. We intend to maintain our emphasis on these types of loans. These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss and require a commensurately higher loan loss allowance than owner-occupied 1-4 family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances compared to 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. Commercial business and equipment loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayments from the cash flows of the borrower\u2019s business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. Also, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to a 1-4 family residential mortgage loan. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $6.5 million, or 86.1% and $16.9 million, or 92.9%, respectively, of our non-accrual loans of $7.6 million and $18.2 million, respectively, consisted of commercial loans.\nImposition of limits by the bank regulators on commercial real estate lending activities could curtail the Company\u2019s growth and adversely affect its earnings.\nIn 2006, the federal banking regulators issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices,\u201d referred to as the CRE Guidance. Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory inquiry where total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and\nthe outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. In December 2015, the federal banking regulators released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending, that indicated the intent to continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans the Bank can hold in its portfolio, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2021, the Bank\u2019s total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans represented 331.40% of the Bank\u2019s total risk-based capital. Management has established a CRE lending framework to monitor specific exposures and limits by types within the CRE portfolio and takes appropriate actions, as necessary.\nWe may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge-off additional loans in the future. Further, our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $0.6 million and $10.7 million, respectively. We recorded net loan charge-offs of $1.6 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our non-accrual loans, OREO and accruing TDRs totaled $8.1 million, or 0.35% of total assets and $21.9 million, or 1.08% of total assets, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Loans that were classified as special mention and substandard were $5.2 million and $26.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 2020. We had no loans classified as doubtful or loss at December 31, 2021 and 2020. If the economy and/or the real estate market weakens, more of our classified loans may become non-performing and we may be required to take additional provisions to increase our allowance for loan losses for these assets as the value of the collateral may be insufficient to pay any remaining net loan balance, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date.\nHowever, our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers\u2019 abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges and other factors. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, our actual losses may vary from our current estimates. Additionally, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience increased levels of non-performing loans, charge-offs and delinquencies, which would require additional increases in our provision for loan losses.\nCredit risks are inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of non-payment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions. Our credit risk approval and monitoring procedures may not mitigate these credit risks, and they cannot be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks. If the overall economic climate fails to improve, or even if it does improve, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, and the level of non-performing loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease.\nNon-performing and classified assets could take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, our non-accrual loans totaled $7.6 million, or 0.48% of our loan portfolio and $18.2 million, or 1.21% of our loan portfolio, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our non-accrual loans, OREO and accruing TDRs totaled $8.1 million, or 0.35% of total assets and $21.9 million, or 1.08% of total assets, respectively. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not accrue interest income on non-accrual loans or foreclosed properties, thereby adversely affecting our net income and returns on assets and equity, increasing our loan administration costs and adversely affecting our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its fair market value less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. These non-performing loans and foreclosed properties also increase our risk profile and the amount of capital our regulators believe is appropriate to maintain. The resolution of non-performing assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we experience increases in non-performing loans and non-performing assets, our net interest income will be negatively impacted, and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which could have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such as return on assets and equity.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020 our total classified assets were $5.2 million and $22.4 million, respectively. While we continue to accrue interest income on classified loans that are performing, classified loans and other classified assets may negatively impact profitability by requiring additional management attention and regular monitoring. Increased monitoring of these assets by management may impact our ability to focus on opportunistic growth, potentially adversely impacting future profitability.\nOur residential mortgage loans and home equity loans expose us to a risk of loss due to declining real estate values.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, $91.1 million, or 5.8%, of our total loan portfolio, and $133.8 million, or 8.9%, of our total loan portfolio, respectively, consisted of owner-occupied 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $25.6 million, or 1.6%, of our total loan portfolio and $29.1 million, or 1.9%, of our total loan portfolio, respectively, consisted of home equity loans and lines of credit. A decline in real estate values in our area could cause some of our mortgage and home equity loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nAny delays in our ability to foreclose on delinquent mortgage loans may negatively impact our business.\nThe origination of mortgage loans occurs with the expectation that, if the borrower defaults, the ultimate loss would be mitigated by the value of the collateral that secures the mortgage loan. The ability to mitigate the losses on defaulted loans depends upon the ability to promptly foreclose upon the collateral after an appropriate cure period. The length of the foreclosure process depends on state law and other factors, such as the volume of foreclosures and actions taken by the borrower to stop the foreclosure. Any delay in the foreclosure process will adversely affect us by increasing the expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and exposes us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral.\nOur asset valuation methodologies, estimations and assumptions may be subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to asset valuations that materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flows and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value some of our assets if trading becomes less frequent and market data becomes less observable. There may be asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, asset valuation may require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation.\nWe may be adversely affected by economic conditions in our market area, which is significantly dependent on federal government and military employment and programs.\nOur marketplace is primarily in the counties of Charles, Calvert, St. Mary\u2019s and Anne Arundel, Maryland and neighboring communities, and the Fredericksburg area of Virginia. Many, if not most, of our customers live and/or work in those counties or in the greater Washington, DC metropolitan area. A significant portion of the population in our market area is affiliated with or employed by the federal government or at military facilities located in the area which contribute to the local economy. Because our services are concentrated in this market, we are affected by the general economic conditions in the greater Washington, DC area. Additionally, changes in the economy may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit pricing. A significant decline in economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, a reduction in federal government or military employment or programs or other factors could decrease the demand for banking products and services generally and/or impair the ability of existing borrowers to repay their loans, which could negatively affect our financial condition and performance. Declines in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans. A decline in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. Additionally, a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses, which would hurt our profits. A decline in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nInterest Rate Risks\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings.\nOur largest component of earnings is net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Changing interest rates impact customer actions and may limit the options available to us to maximize earnings or increase the costs to minimize risk. Our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margin and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to increase or decrease. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve\u201d or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates could also reduce our net interest margin. Our procedures for managing exposure to falling net interest income involve modeling possible scenarios of interest rate increases and decreases to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates also can affect: (1) our ability to originate loans; (2) the value of our interest-earning assets; (3) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, particularly adjustable or variable rate loans.\nChanges in market interest rates are affected by many factors, including inflation, unemployment, money supply, fiscal policies of the U.S. government, domestic and international events, and events in U.S. and other financial markets. We attempt to manage its risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, re-pricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, but interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. Changes in the market interest rates for types of products and services in various markets also may vary significantly and over time based upon competition and local or regional economic factors.\nChanges to and replacement of the London InterBank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") Benchmark Interest Rate may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have certain loans, investment securities and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to LIBOR. LIBOR is the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including our lending and borrowing and our purchase and sale of securities that we use to manage risk related to such transactions. However, a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing coupled with recent legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions has led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. The administrator for LIBOR announced on March 5, 2021 that it will permanently cease to publish most LIBOR settings beginning on January 1, 2022 and cease to publish the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month USD LIBOR settings on July 1, 2023. Accordingly, the FCA has stated that is does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to LIBOR after such respective dates. Until such time, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR. In October 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR Transition. In that guidance, the agencies offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from LIBOR. The failure to properly transition away from LIBOR may result in increased supervisory scrutiny.\nWe have not yet determined which alternative rate is most applicable, and there can be no assurances on which benchmark rate(s) may replace LIBOR or how LIBOR will be determined for purposes of financial instruments that are currently referencing LIBOR when it ceases to exist. The discontinuance of LIBOR may result in uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and may also increase operational and other risks to us and the industry.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and\n\u2022require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark.\nIn addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates. We cannot reasonably estimate these expected costs.\nLiquidity Risks\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on debt obligations and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Core deposits and FHLB advances are our primary source of funding. A significant decrease in core deposits, an inability to renew FHLB advances, an inability to obtain alternative funding to core deposits or FHLB advances, or a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur deposit concentrations may subject us to additional liquidity and pricing risk.\nSignificant variations in deposit concentrations and pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We manage portfolio diversification through our asset/liability committee process. We occasionally accept larger deposit customers, and our typical deposit customers might occasionally carry larger balances. The aggregate amount of our top 25 deposit relationships were $499.7 million, or 24.7%, of our total assets at December 31, 2020 and $628.0 million, or 27.0% of our total assets at December 31, 2021. The FDIC\u2019s examination policies require that we monitor all customer deposit concentrations at or above 2% of total deposits. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had two local municipal customer deposit relationships that exceeded 2% of total deposits, totaling $335.6 million which represented 16.3% of total deposits of $2,056.2 million. At December 31, 2020, there were two municipal customer deposit relationships that exceeded 2% of total deposits, totaling $238.8 million which represented 13.7% of total deposits of $1,745.6 million.\nThe replacement of deposit concentrations with wholesale funding could cause our overall cost of funds to increase, which would reduce our net interest income and results of operations. A decline in interest-earning assets would also lower our net interest income and results of operations.\nThe Company is a bank holding company and its sources of funds necessary to meet its obligations are limited.\nThe Company is a bank holding company, and its operations are primarily conducted by the Bank, which is subject to significant federal and state regulation. Cash available to pay dividends to our stockholders, pay our obligations and meet our debt service requirements is derived from dividends received from the Bank. Future dividend payments by the Bank to the Company will require generation of earnings by the Bank and are subject to regulatory guidelines. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not have the resources or cash flow to pay or meet all of its obligations.\nOperational Risks\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We,\nour customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet, mobile applications, and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. We provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet, mobile applications and the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Despite instituted safeguards and monitoring, our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, attacks by hackers, or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, physical and cyber security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in significant costs to us, which may include fines and penalties, potential liabilities from governmental or third party investigations, proceedings or litigation, legal, forensic and consulting fees and expenses, costs and diversion of management attention required for investigation and remediation actions, and the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our customers and others, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, revenues, financial condition and competitive position.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules. Sarbanes-Oxley requires our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. Matters impacting our internal control over financial reporting may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we report a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us by, for example, leading to a decline in our stock price and impairing our ability to raise capital.\nOur internal control systems are inherently limited.\nOur systems of internal controls, disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and procedures are inherently limited. The inherent limitations of our system of internal controls include the use of judgment in decision-making that can be faulty; breakdowns can occur because of human error or mistakes; and controls can be circumvented by individual acts or by collusion of two or more people. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, any plans of remediation for any identified limitations may be ineffective in improving our internal controls.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as core data processing systems, internet, mobile applications, connections, network access and fund distribution. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we cannot control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those which result from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise to conduct its business. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe high volume of transactions we process exposes us to significant operational risks.\nWe rely on our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or outside persons, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulations, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. A breakdown in our internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in material financial loss, the imposition of regulatory action, and damage to our reputation.\nIf our information technology is unable to keep pace with industry developments, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nExiting or entering new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nWe may exit an existing line of business or implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. When exiting a line of business or product we may have difficulty replacing the revenue stream and may have to take certain actions to make up for the line of business or product. If those sources are not available or the cost for such purchases increases our results of operations may be adversely affected. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. We also may face increased credit risk for new or certain loan products. Furthermore, any new line of business or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject, based upon the size, scope, and complexity of the Company.\nAs a financial institution, we are subject to interest rate, credit, liquidity, legal/compliance, market, strategic, operational, and reputational risks. Our enterprise risk management (\u201cERM\u201d) framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. For example, economic and market conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, and increases in the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated, highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques. As a result, the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and\nresults of operations. Furthermore, an ineffective ERM framework, as well as other risk factors, could result in a material increase in our FDIC insurance premiums.\nThe adoption of flexible work from home arrangements poses a number of operational risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we transitioned to a remote working environment, with a peak of 30% of employees working remotely. While we have since brought employees back to the office, we have adopted more flexible work arrangements that permit some employees to work from home full or part time. Having employees conduct their daily work in our offices helps to ensure a level of productivity and operational security that may not be achieved when working remotely for an extended period. Remote work arrangements could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk, as remote working environments can be less secure. Over time, remote work arrangements may decrease the ability to maintain our culture, which is integral to our success. Additionally, a remote working environment may impede our ability to undertake new business projects and foster a creative environment. As remote work arrangements become more flexible and commonplace, our ability to compete for qualified employees could be challenged. The prevalence of remote work arrangements will expand competition among employers and may put us at a disadvantage if it is unable or unwilling to offer the same level of flexibility. Failure to attract and retain the desired workforce could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Financial Statements\nChanges in accounting standards or interpretation of new or existing standards may affect how the Company report its financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change accounting regulations and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, bank regulators and outside independent auditors may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how to record and report the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, there could be a requirement to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nThe implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.\nFASB has adopted an accounting standard that will be effective for the Company\u2019s first fiscal year after December 15, 2022 unless the Company chooses early adoption which the Company elected to do in January 2022. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, compared to the incurred loss model. CECL requires advanced modeling techniques, heavy reliance on assumptions, and dependence on historical data that may not accurately forecast losses. The adoption of CECL can result in greater volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses, depending on various factors and assumptions applied in the model, such as the forecasted economic conditions in the foreseeable future and loan payment behaviors. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, can have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that could continue to have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single family residential and multi-family residential real estate. Changes resultant of this legislation included: lower limits on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single family residential mortgages; the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans; a limitation on deductibility of business interest expense; and a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. Such changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, single family residential properties and multifamily residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future. In addition, these changes may have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes. If home ownership or multifamily residential property ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans would decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership and multifamily residential ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses. Additionally, certain borrowers could become less able to service their debts as a result of higher tax obligations. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, local, state or federal tax authorities may interpret laws and regulations differently from our and challenge tax positions that we have taken on its tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest, penalties or litigation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2021, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $11.9 million. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities may be subject to refinement as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available and may result in adjustments to goodwill within the first 12 months following the closing date of the acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant decline in expected future cash flows, a material change in interest rates, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant or sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting estimates, and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes that we use to estimate its allowance for loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on its financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models that we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models that we use for determining its allowance for loan losses are inadequate, the allowance may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models that we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination as noted in the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of this report. The regulation and supervision by the Maryland Commissioner, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC are not intended to protect the interests of investors in our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and sound financial condition, permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, permissible nonbanking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we may conduct business and obtain financing. The laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us and the Bank are subject to regular modification and change. Such changes may, among other things, increase the cost of doing business, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, and leasing companies.\nWe are subject to periodic examination and scrutiny by a number of banking agencies and, depending upon the findings and determinations of these agencies, we may be required to make adjustments to our business that could adversely affect us.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentration, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk or other aspects of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management is in violation of any law or\nregulation, it could take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by law.\nOur ability to pay dividends is governed by the policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, which prohibits the payment of dividends under certain circumstances dependent on our financial condition and capital adequacy. Our ability to pay dividends is also dependent on the receipt of dividends from the Bank. Federal regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other capital distributions by the Bank. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is governed by the Maryland Financial Institutions Code and the regulations of the FDIC. Under the Maryland Financial Institutions Code, a Maryland bank (1) may only pay dividends from undivided profits or, with prior regulatory approval, its surplus in excess of 100% of required capital stock and, (2) may not declare dividends on its common stock until its surplus funds equals the amount of required capital stock, or if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, in an amount in excess of 90% of net earnings. Without the approval of the FDIC, Bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the year exceeds its net income during the current calendar year and retained net income for the prior two years.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. In recent years, various significant economic and monetary stimulus measures were implemented by the U.S. Congress and the Federal Reserve pursued a highly accommodative monetary policy aimed at keeping interest rates at historically low levels. U.S. economic activity has significantly improved, but there can be no assurance that this progress will continue or will not reverse.\nAn important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u201cPATRIOT Act\u201d) and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA requires the Federal Reserve to assess the Bank\u2019s performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. If the Federal Reserve determines that the Bank needs to improve its performance or is in substantial non-compliance with CRA requirements, various adverse regulatory consequences may ensue. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. The CFPB authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial products or services, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The ongoing broad rule making powers of the CFPB have potential to significantly impact the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services.\nA successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, fair lending laws or regulations, or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions expansion activities, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket Risks\nThe market price and liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if the economy were to weaken or the capital markets were to experience volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects. Among other factors, these risks may be affected by:\n\u2022Operating results that vary from the expectations of our management or of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022Developments in our business or in the financial services sector generally;\n\u2022Regulatory or legislative changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;\n\u2022Operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u2022Changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or rating agencies;\n\u2022Announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings, and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022Changes or volatility in global financial markets and economies, general market conditions, interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit, or asset valuations; and\n\u2022Significant fluctuations in the capital markets.\nEconomic or market turmoil could occur in the near or long term, which could negatively affect our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations, as well as volatility in the price and trading volume of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders or impact shareholder returns.\nIn order to maintain our capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, or to fund future growth including through acquisitions of other financial institutions, our board of directors may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of our common or preferred stock. The sale of these shares may significantly dilute your ownership interest as a shareholder. New investors in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders which may adversely impact our current shareholders. In addition, the issuance of certain debt that qualifies as regulatory capital could increase interest expense and impact profitability.\nStrategic Risks\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to timely and effectively execute or manage our strategic plan, particularly if we grow through acquisitions of other financial institutions.\nAmong other things, our strategic plan currently calls for reducing the amount of our non-performing assets, growing assets through commercial lending and generating transaction deposit accounts to reduce our funding costs and improve our net interest margin. Our ability to increase profitability in accordance with this plan will depend on a variety of factors including the identification of desirable business opportunities, competitive responses from financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage liquidity and funding sources. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our strategic plan, opportunities may not be available and that the strategic plan may not be successful or effectively managed.\nCombining acquired businesses may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of acquisitions may not be realized.\nIn implementing our strategic plan, we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets through opportunistic acquisitions of whole banks or branch locations. The success of any mergers and acquisitions we undertake, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the acquired business in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, employees and other constituents or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our to successfully conduct our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our common stock. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of a transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on us during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of a transaction. It is possible that the potential cost savings could turn out to be more difficult to achieve than anticipated. The cost savings estimates also depend on the ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Maryland law, as well as state and federal banking regulations, could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Maryland corporate law could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions include: super majority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at shareholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Maryland laws, including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nOur profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our competition for loans and deposits includes banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies, credit unions and non-banking financial institutions. We compete with regional and national financial institutions that have a substantial presence in our market area, many of which have greater liquidity, higher lending limits, greater access to capital, more established market recognition and more resources than we do. Furthermore, tax-exempt credit unions operate in our market area and aggressively price their products and services to a large portion of the market. This competition may make it more difficult for us to originate new loans and may force us to offer higher deposit rates than we currently offer. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in lower interest rates earned on our loans and higher interest rates paid on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nAs a community bank, our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and in our local market area. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, consumer confidence and spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the economy in the United States generally and, in particular, our market area. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; pandemics; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Elevated levels of unemployment, declines in the values of real estate, extended federal government shutdowns, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and reduce demand for banking products and services.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Investors, consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as investor, consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, among other impacts. The impact on the Company\u2019s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. In addition, the Company could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Investors could determine not to invest in the Company\u2019s stock due to various climate change related considerations. The Company\u2019s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting the Company from the impacts of new laws and regulations or changes in investor, consumer or business behavior.", "PERMNO": 14175, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TCFC"}
