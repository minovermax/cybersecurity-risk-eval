{"cik": "1448431", "company": "OptimizeRx Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nBecause we have historically experienced losses, if we are unable to achieve profitability, our financial condition and company could suffer.\nWhile we were profitable for the full year of 2021, since the inception of our business we have historically incurred losses as a result of investing in future growth. We incurred losses in 2019 and 2020 as a result of our increased spending to build the organization to support expected future growth - both through additional new hires, as well as through acquisitions. While we have increased revenues significantly, we have not yet consistently achieved profitability due to these investments and non-cash expenses. Our ability to achieve consistent profitability depends on our ability to generate sales through our technology platform and advertising model, while maintaining reasonable expense levels. If we do not achieve sustainable profitability, it may impact our ability to continue our operations.\nThe global pandemic may disrupt our business or the business of our customers\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of corona virus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19 was reported. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency and Global Pandemic. COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a severe impact on economies around the world, in particular in the healthcare industry in which we operate. We have taken steps to modify our business practices and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on us, and may take further precautions as required by government authorities or to protect the health of our employees, customer, and partners - but there can be no assurance that such steps will be successful, or that our business operations, or the operations of our customers or partners will not be materially and adversely affected by the consequences of the pandemic. This could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to support our technology to further scale our operations successfully.\nOur plan is to grow rapidly through further integration of our technology in electronic platforms. Our growth will place significant demands on our management and technology development, as well as our financial, administrative and other resources. We cannot guarantee that any of the systems, procedures and controls we put in place will be adequate to support the commercialization of our operations. Our operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our financial, administrative and other resources. If we are unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, or the scale of our solutions, services and operations, then the quality of our services, our ability to retain key personnel and our business could be harmed.\nDeveloping and implementing new and updated applications, features and services for our portals may be more difficult than expected, may take longer and cost more than expected and may not result in sufficient increases in revenue to justify the costs.\nAttracting and retaining users of our portals requires us to continue to improve the technology underlying those portals and to continue to develop new and updated applications, features and services for those portals. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we are unable to implement new applications, features and services without disruption to our existing ones, we may lose potential users and clients. The costs of development of these enhancements may negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability.\nWe rely on a combination of internal development, strategic relationships, licensing and acquisitions to develop our portals and related applications, features and services. Our development and/or implementation of new technologies, applications, features and services may cost more than expected, may take longer than originally expected, may require more testing than originally anticipated and may require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources. There can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from any new or updated technologies, applications, features or services will justify the amounts spent.\nAny failure to offer high-quality customer support for our portals may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and harm our financial results.\nOnce our solutions are implemented, our customers use our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our solutions. In addition, we also believe that our success in selling our solutions is highly dependent on our business reputation and on favorable recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to maintain existing customers or sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could also increase costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are dependent on a concentrated group of customers.\nOur revenues are concentrated in less than 50 customers, primarily large pharmaceutical manufacturers. Loss of one or more of our larger customers could have a negative impact on our operating results. In both 2021 and 2020, we had three customers that each represented slightly over 10% of our revenues; however only one customer represented over 10% of our revenues in both years.\nWe expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss of any of these customers or groups of customers for any reason, or a change of relationship with any of our key customers could cause a material decrease in our total revenues.\nAdditionally, mergers or consolidations among our customers in the healthcare industry could reduce the number of our customers and could adversely affect our revenues and sales. In particular, if our customers are acquired by entities that are not also our customers, that do not use our solutions or that have more favorable contract terms with competitors and choose to discontinue, reduce or change the terms of their use of our solutions, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain our contracts with electronic prescription platforms, our business will suffer.\nWe are reliant upon our contracts with leading electronic prescribing platforms and electronic health record systems to generate our revenues received from customers Such arrangements subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf Our contract partners may experience financial, regulatory or operational difficulties, which may impair their ability to focus on and fulfill their contract obligations to us;\n\u25cf Legal disputes or disagreements, including the ownership of intellectual property, may occur with one or more of our partners and may lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration;\n\u25cf Significant changes in a partner\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a partner\u2019s willingness or ability to satisfy obligations under any such arrangement; and\n\u25cf A partner could terminate the partnership arrangement, which could negatively impact our ability to sell our solutions and achieve revenues.\nWe will need to maintain these relationships as well as diversify them. The inability to do so could adversely impact our business. We generated 53.9% and 52.7% of our revenue through our largest partner in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur agreements with electronic prescription platforms and electronic health record systems are subject to audit.\nOur agreements with our partners provide for revenue sharing payments to the platform partners based on the revenue we generate through the platform. These payments are subject to audit by our partners, at their cost, and if there is a dispute as to the calculation, we may be liable for additional payments. If an underpayment is determined to be in excess of a certain amount, for example 10%, some agreements would require us to pay for the cost of the audit, as well.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to attract, retain customers, and the loss of existing customers, or failure to attract new ones, could adversely impact our business and future prospects.\nWe currently work with many leading pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, associations, and other companies. While we have experienced customer growth, this growth may not continue at the same pace in the future or at all. Achieving growth in our customer base may require us to engage in increasingly sophisticated and costly sales and marketing efforts that may not result in additional customers. We may also need to modify our pricing model to attract and retain such customers. If we fail to attract new customers or fail to maintain or expand existing relationships in a cost-effective manner, our business and future prospects may be materially and adversely impacted.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations that affect the healthcare industry, including data protection, privacy and security, fraud and abuse laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous state, federal and foreign laws, requirements and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal information, including health-related information. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer, use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing our processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, government investigations and enforcement actions, claims by third parties, and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business.\nWe also may be bound by contractual obligations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security that are more stringent than applicable laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security are significant. Although we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, our contractual obligations and other legal obligations, these requirements are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with another or other legal obligations with which we must comply. Accordingly, our failure, or perceived inability, to comply with these laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations may limit the use and adoption of our solution, reduce overall demand for our solution, lead to regulatory investigations, breach of contract claims, litigation, and significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for actual or alleged noncompliance or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the rules promulgated thereunder require certain entities, referred to as Covered Entities, to comply with established standards, including standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA further requires that Covered Entities enter into agreements meeting certain regulatory requirements with their business associates, as such term is defined by HIPAA, which, among other things, obligate the business associates to safeguard the covered entity\u2019s PHI against improper use and disclosure. While we are not a Covered Entity and not directly regulated by HIPAA, our customers or distributors might face significant contractual liability pursuant to such an agreement if the business associate breaches the agreement or causes the Covered Entity to fail to comply with HIPAA. It is possible that HIPAA compliance could become a substantial regulatory burden and expense to our operations as we expand our point of care technology solutions to help patients start and stay on therapies.\nCertain other laws and regulations such as federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws may apply to us indirectly through our relationships with our customers and partners. Violations can result in considerable penalties and sanctions. If we are found to have violated, or to have facilitated the violation of such laws, we could be subject to significant penalties.\nIf we are unable to adhere to the regulatory and competitive climate in which we operate, we could be materially and negatively impacted.\nDue to the labyrinth of regulations in healthcare space, state and federal, as well as political sensitivity of healthcare delivery, our business model could be negatively impacted or fail.\nThe markets in which we operate are competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases, subject to rapid change.\nOur platforms face competition from numerous other companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors. We compete for users with online services and websites that provide savings on medications and healthcare products, including both commercial sites and not-for-profit sites. We compete for advertisers and sponsors with health-related web sites, general purpose consumer web sites that offer specialized health sub-channels, other high-traffic web sites that include both healthcare-related and non-healthcare-related content and services, search engines that provide specialized health searches, and advertising networks that aggregate traffic from multiple sites.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do. These organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers or users than we do. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations or any alliances they have formed or may form. Since there are no substantial barriers to entry into the markets in which our public portals participate, we expect that competitors will continue to enter these markets.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nMost of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes affecting healthcare spending. We are particularly dependent on pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies for our advertising and sponsorship revenue.\nGeneral reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n\u25cf Government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients, payers or other healthcare industry participants, including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services;\n\u25cf Government regulation prohibiting the use of coupons by patients covered by federally funded health insurance programs;\n\u25cf Consolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n\u25cf Reductions or changes in governmental funding for healthcare; and\n\u25cf Adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies or other healthcare industry participants.\nEven if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve or are planning to serve. For example, use of our solutions and services could be affected by:\n\u25cf Changes in the design of health insurance plans;\n\u25cf A decrease in the number of new drugs or medical devices coming to market;\n\u25cf A decrease in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical or medical device companies, including as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit advertising or sponsorship activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies; and\n\u25cf Payor pressure to move to generic brands.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to solutions and services of the types we provide.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the markets for our solutions and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nIf we are unable to manage growth, our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to manage growth effectively will depend on our ability to improve and expand operations, including our financial and management information systems, and to recruit, train and manage personnel. There can be no absolute assurance that management will be able to manage growth effectively. To manage growth effectively, we will be required to continue to implement and improve our operating and financial systems and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively will require us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, and to attract and retain sufficient talented personnel.\nIf we do not properly manage the growth of our business, we may experience significant strains on our management and operations and disruptions in our business. Various risks arise when companies grow too quickly. If our business grows too quickly, our ability to meet customer demand in a timely and efficient manner could be challenged. We may also experience development delays as we seek to meet increased demand for our solutions. Our failure to properly manage the growth that we or our industry might experience could negatively impact our ability to execute on our operating plan and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on our business, our cash flow and results of operations, and our reputation with our current or potential customers.\nOur growth may be impacted by acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nOur future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, or integrate acquisitions successfully. We may seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to further diversify our business and to penetrate or expand important product offerings or markets. There are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses, or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.\nOur success has been largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our key employees and the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees, without a properly executed transition plan, could have an adverse effect on us. The loss of any member of our senior management team or any of our other key employees could damage critical customer relationships, result in the loss of vital knowledge, experience and expertise, could lead to an increase in recruitment and training costs and make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and execute our business strategy. We may not be able to find qualified potential replacements for these individuals and the integration of potential replacements may be disruptive to our business.\nFurthermore, our ability to expand operations to accommodate our anticipated growth will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified media, management, finance, marketing, sales and technical personnel. However, competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals. Our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit, train and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand our technology and business. If we are unable to engage and retain the necessary personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from and incremental to those in the United States. In addition to the risks that we face in the United States, our international operations in Israel and Croatia, may involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u25cf difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf natural or man-made disasters, political, social and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease (such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19), boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions;\n\u25cf compliance with United States laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf less favorable foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u25cf adverse tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the United States, non-income related taxes such as value-added tax or other indirect taxes, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, or the application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities given inter-company transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u25cf profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u25cf differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\u25cf new and different sources of competition;\n\u25cf different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws; and\n\u25cf availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, as well as results of our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology\nWe are dependent, in part, on our intellectual property. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights or if those rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent, in part, on our ability to innovate, and, as a result, we are reliant on our intellectual property. We generally protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other measures to the extent our budget permits. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications that we have filed or that our patents will be sufficient to protect our key technology from misappropriation or falling into the public domain, nor can assurances be made that any of our patents, patent applications, trademarks or our other intellectual property or proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In the event a competitor or other party successfully challenges our solutions, processes, patents or licenses or claims that we have infringed upon their intellectual property, we could incur substantial litigation costs defending against such claims, be required to pay royalties, license fees or other damages or be barred from using the intellectual property at issue, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot assure you that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property and other contractual agreements for our business will be adequate, that our competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially equivalent or superior technologies or be able to design around patents that we may receive, or that our intellectual property will not be misappropriated.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a disadvantage to others who do not incur the substantial time and expense we incur. Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. Moreover, it may be difficult or practically impossible to detect theft or unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, insurance, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems, maintenance of backup and protective systems and user training and education), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, loss of customers, litigation with customers and other parties, loss of trade secrets and other proprietary business data and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nOur business will suffer if our network systems fail or become unavailable.\nA reduction in the performance, reliability and availability of our network infrastructure would harm our ability to distribute our solutions to our users, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. Our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, Internet breakdown, earthquake and similar events. Our systems could also be subject to viruses, break-ins, sabotage, acts of terrorism, acts of vandalism, hacking, cyber-terrorism and similar misconduct. We might not carry adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage. Any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability of our solutions or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions, then our solutions and services could be less attractive to our users and our business would be materially harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nIf a market for our common stock is not maintained, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares.\nOur common stock is traded under the symbol \u201cOPRX\u201d on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We do not currently have a consistent active trading market. There can be no assurance that a consistent active and liquid trading market will develop or, if developed, that it will be sustained.\nHistorically, our securities have been thinly traded. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock without significantly depressing the value of the stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur stock price is subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf Technological innovations or new solutions and services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf Government regulation of our solutions and services;\n\u25cf The establishment of partnerships with other healthcare companies;\n\u25cf Intellectual property disputes;\n\u25cf Additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf Sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf Our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf Operating results below or exceeding expectations;\n\u25cf Our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf Loss or addition of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cf General financial, domestic, international, economic, industry and other market trends or conditions; and\n\u25cf Period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nOur stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the above. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund our future growth and do not expect to declare or pay any dividend on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock may depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which it was purchased.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to shareholders.\nThe Company is a Nevada corporation. Anti-takeover provisions in Nevada law and our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if the Company is sold. For example, our charter provides that the board of directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. In addition, our bylaws provide that shareholders cannot act by written consent and that directors may be removed by shareholders only with the approval of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the voting power of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote at an annual or special meeting of the shareholders.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. As a result, current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the trading price of our stock and our ability to retain our current customers or obtain new customers.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have had material weaknesses in the past that were remediated as of December 31, 2020. We cannot provide assurance that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may be required to implement further remedial measures and to design enhanced processes and controls to address deficiencies, which could result in significant costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities. If we identify material weaknesses or fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to prepare reliable financial reports and comply with our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act on a timely basis. Any such delays in the preparation of financial reports and the filing of our periodic reports may result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the commencement of litigation, or the commencement of regulatory action against us, which may include court actions or administrative proceedings, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, the market value of our securities and our access to the capital markets.", "PERMNO": 17895, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "OPRX"}
