{"cik": "1722964", "company": "Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, and in our other filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since inception. Our only product approved for sale is DANYELZA, which only recently received approval and we have never generated any substantial revenue from product sales. We expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or maintain profitability, which may cause the market value of our common stock to decline significantly.\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Since our inception in 2015, we have incurred significant losses each year. Our net losses were $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021 our accumulated deficit was approximately $340.5 million. We have financed our operations principally through private placements, the initial public offering of our common stock in 2018 as well as our public offerings in November 2019 and February 2021.\nTo date, we have devoted substantially all our efforts to research and development of DANYELZA our only approved product and our other lead product candidate omburtamab. On November 25, 2020, DANYELZA was approved by the FDA for the treatment, in combination with GM-CSF, of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and adult patients R/R high-risk NB, in the bone or bone marrow who have demonstrated a partial response, minor response, or stable disease to prior therapy. While our lead product candidate omburtamab is in registration stage clinical development, no assurance can be given that we will receive regulatory approval for the sale of omburtamab or other product candidates in the near term, if at all. Our other product candidates are in the early stages of clinical development or pre-clinical research. As a result, we expect that it will be a number of years, if ever, before we have any of these other product candidates approved and ready for commercialization.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Our only product approved for sale is DANYELZA, which only received approval in November 2020 and we have not generated any substantial revenue from product sales. We have only begun limited sales and shipments of DANYELZA since February 2021 and we do not\nanticipate generating substantial revenue from product sales until DANYELZA has been on the market for a period of time. No assurance can be given that we will ever receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates other than DANYELZA. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our success in many factors, including:\n\u25cf the successful launch and commercialization of DANYELZA and our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\n\u25cf completing research regarding, and non-clinical and clinical development of, our product candidates;\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory approvals, marketing authorizations and coverage and reimbursements from payors for DANYELZA and other product candidates for which we complete clinical studies;\n\u25cf developing and maintaining a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for DANYELZA and our other product candidates, including establishing and maintaining commercially viable supply relationships with third parties including Patheon/Thermo Fisher and EMD/Merck or establishing our own manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure;\n\u25cf obtaining market acceptance of DANYELZA and our product candidates as viable treatment options;\n\u25cf addressing any competing products, product candidates, related technologies and/or market developments;\n\u25cf identifying, assessing, acquiring and/or developing new product candidates;\n\u25cf negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, distribution or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u25cf maintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how;\n\u25cf attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf adequately financing our operations at acceptable terms.\nWe anticipate incurring research, development, clinical trial, manufacturing and marketing costs associated with commercializing even approved products such as DANYELZA. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to change our manufacturing processes or assays, or to perform clinical, non-clinical, or other types of studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market more of our product candidates, such as DANYELZA in the US, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to obtain reimbursement at any price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably expected population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved. If we are not able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of DANYELZA or any other approved products, we may never become profitable.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe were incorporated and began our operations on April 30, 2015. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, commercializing DANYELZA, conducting\nclinical trials of DANYELZA and our lead product candidates and conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our other product candidates, and identifying additional potential product candidates. Typically, it takes about six to 10 years to develop a new drug from the time it is in Phase 1 clinical trials to when it is approved for treating patients, but in many cases it may take longer. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. In addition, as a business with a limited operating history, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors as we continue to develop and commercialize DANYELZA and our other product candidates.\nOur payment obligations to MSK and MIT may be a drain on our cash resources, or may cause us to incur debt obligations or issue additional equity securities to satisfy such payment obligations, which may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nUnder the MSK License, we have committed to funding scientific research as well as conducting certain clinical trial activities at MSK. As licensed product candidates progress through clinical development and commercialization, certain milestone payments will come due, and we will owe MSK customary royalties on commercial sales of our approved products, if any. Milestone payments become due upon achievement of the related clinical, regulatory or sales-based milestone set forth in the MSK license agreements and all milestones are accrued for when they are probable and estimable. Certain of the clinical and regulatory milestone payments become due at the earlier of completion of the related milestone activity or the date indicated in the MSK license agreements, whether or not the milestone activity has been achieved. Total clinical and regulatory milestones potentially due under the MSK License are $2,450,000 and $9,000,000, respectively. There are also sales-based milestones that become due should we achieve certain amounts of sales of licensed products with total sales-based milestones potentially due of $20,000,000. Under the MSK CD33 License, we are obligated to make potential payments of $550,000, $500,000 and $7,500,000 for clinical, regulatory and sales-based milestones, respectively.\nIn April 2020, we entered into the SADA License Agreement which requires us to pay to MSK and MIT mid to high single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products or the performance of licensed services by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. We are obligated to pay annual minimum royalties of $40,000, increasing to $60,000 once a patent has been issued, over the royalty term, commencing on the tenth anniversary of the SADA License. These amounts are nonrefundable but are creditable against royalty payments otherwise due under the SADA License. We are also obligated to pay to MSK and MIT certain clinical, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments under the SADA License Agreement. Certain of the clinical and regulatory milestone payments become due at the earlier of completion of the related milestone activity or the date indicated in the SADA License Agreement. Total clinical and regulatory milestone payments potentially due under the SADA License Agreement are $4,730,000 and $18,125,000, respectively. Additionally, we are also obligated to make sales-based milestones payments totaling $23,750,000, that become due should we achieve certain amounts of sales of licensed products under the SADA License. In addition, for each of the SADA constructs generated by MSK and sold on our behalf by one of our sublicenses, we may pay sales-based milestone payments in the total amount of $60,000,000 based on the achievement of various levels of cumulative net sales by the sublicensee. Under the SADA License Agreement, we have also committed to fund scientific research at MSK under a Sponsored Research Agreement for up to $1,500,000 over three years.\nIn addition, we have committed to acquire certain personnel and laboratory services at MSK under a Master Data Services Agreement, or MDSA, and two separate Core Facility Service Agreements, or CFSAs. We have also entered into an Investigator-Sponsored Master Clinical Trial Agreement, or the MCTA, with MSK under which we will provide drug product and funding for certain clinical trials at MSK under separate appendices to be executed. Additionally, we have entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement, or the SRA, with MSK pursuant to which we paid MSK to conduct certain research projects over a period of five years related to the intellectual property licensed under the MSK License. The SRA was amended on September 13, 2019, and will expire five years from the date of the amendment. We entered into a Manufacturing Agreement with MSK\u2019s Radiochemistry and Molecular Imaging Probes Core Facility, or RMIP, pursuant to which RMIP will complete specified manufacturing activities related to 131I-omburtamab in connection with Study 101. We also remain responsible for any potential downstream payment obligations to MSK related to the GD2-GD3 Vaccine. This includes our obligation to make development and regulatory\nmilestone payments totaling $1,400,000, annual minimum royalties of $10,000, increasing to $25,000 from approval of the first NDA/BLA for a licensed product over the royalty term, and mid single-digit royalty payments to MSK on sales.\nThese payments could be significant and in order to satisfy our obligations to MSK and MIT, if and when they are triggered, we may use our existing cash, incur debt obligations or issue additional equity securities, which may materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe will need substantial additional funding until at least such time as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales. If we fail to obtain such additional funding, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and drug development programs or current or future commercialization efforts and our license and other agreements may be terminated.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and commercialization of any approved products, is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we commence sales and marketing of DANYELZA and conduct clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for our lead product candidate omburtamab and our other product candidates. We expect to incur commercialization expenses, which may be significant, related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of DANYELZA or our product candidates to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of any collaborator that we may have at such time for any such product candidate. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, until at least such time as we can generate substantial additional revenues from sales of DANYELZA or our product candidates, if approved, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise sufficient amounts of additional capital when needed or on attractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and drug development programs or our future commercialization efforts.\nChanging circumstances may cause us to increase our spending significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. We will require additional capital for further development and commercialization of our product candidates and may need to raise additional funds earlier if we choose to expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate.\nIn addition, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no firmly committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates or other research and development initiatives. Our licenses and other agreements may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment obligations under the agreements. We could be required to seek collaborators for DANYELZA or our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves. Any of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to DANYELZA or our product candidates on terms unfavorable to us.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our planned operations. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial additional revenues from the sale of DANYELZA and our product candidates, if approved, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of cash on hand, equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and/or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. In addition, debt financing, if available, would result in fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or acquisitions, limiting our ability to conduct licensing transactions,\ncreating liens, redeeming stock or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. In addition, securing financing could require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management\u2019s ability to oversee the commercialization of DANYELZA or other products, if approved, or development of our product candidates.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights related to our intellectual property, future revenue streams or any of our future product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce and/or eliminate our product development or current or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe may expand our resources to pursue a particular product or product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on other products or product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe intend to focus our efforts and managerial resources on specific products and product candidates and on specific indications such as DANYELZA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in bone and/or bone marrow and omburtamab for central nervous system leptomeningeal metastases from neuroblastoma. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other products or product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Failure to properly assess potential product candidates for indications could result in focusing on product candidates for indications with lower market potential, which could harm our business and financial condition. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through partnering, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate or product.\nRisks related to product development and commercialization\nOur only approved product DANYELZA, our product candidates and related technologies are novel approaches to cancer treatment that present significant challenges, and our ability to generate product revenue is dependent on the success of DANYELZA or one or more of our product candidates, which might require additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval and begin commercial sales.\nOur only approved product DANYELZA, our product candidates and related technologies represent novel approaches to cancer treatment generally. Developing and commercializing these products therefore subjects us to a number of challenges. To date we have not generated substantial revenues from sales of DANYELZA which is currently our only approved product. We may never be able to develop another marketable product. Our ability to generate product revenue is highly dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize DANYELZA and to obtain additional regulatory approvals of and successfully commercialize additional product candidates including in particular omburtamab. This will require additional clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory review and approval in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market them, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity, and significant marketing efforts. We cannot be certain that any other of our product candidates will be successful in clinical studies and they may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical studies.\nThe success of our product candidates in development will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u25cf successful and timely completion of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf initiation and successful patient enrollment and completion of additional clinical trials on a timely basis;\n\u25cf safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval;\n\u25cf timely receipt of marketing and reimbursement approvals for our lead product candidates from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf the performance of our future collaborators, if any;\n\u25cf the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf establishment of supply arrangements with third-party raw materials and drug product suppliers and manufacturers;\n\u25cf establishment of scaled production arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished products that are appropriately packaged for sale;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u25cf protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio, including our licensed intellectual property;\n\u25cf successful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval including the hiring of a direct salesforce and creation of marketing campaigns;\n\u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval;\n\u25cf commercial acceptance by physicians and patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and\n\u25cf our ability to compete with other therapies.\nWe do not have complete control over many of these factors, including certain aspects of clinical development and the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales efforts of any future collaborator.\nDANYELZA and our lead product candidate omburtamab are our most advanced product and product candidate. Because our other product candidates are based on similar technology, if DANYELZA or omburtamab encounter safety or efficacy problems, developmental delays, regulatory issues, or other problems, our development plans and business could be significantly harmed. Further, competitors who are developing products with similar technology may experience problems with their products that could identify problems that would potentially harm our business.\nOur normal business operations may, directly or indirectly, be adversely impacted by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 and future outbreak of any highly infectious or contagious diseases, could materially and adversely affect our operations and have a material impact on our financial position. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has caused business continuity issues of an as yet unknown magnitude and duration.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate this pandemic have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in various regions around the world and disruption in the global supply chain and business operations. National, state and local governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, border closures, increased border controls, travel restrictions, shelter in place orders and shutdowns, resulting in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, cancellation of events and other measures. These measures may disrupt normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas and may have significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide. We\ncontinue to monitor our operations and applicable government recommendations, and we have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including limiting travel and working from home and also implemented enhanced travel-safe policies for our employees\u2019 travel to our clinical sites. Prolonged remote working arrangements could impact employees\u2019 productivity and morale, strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks. Operating requirements may continually change due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we may experience unpredictability in our expenses, employee productivity and employee work culture. Additionally, the risk of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our moving increasingly towards a remote working environment, which may be less secure and more susceptible to security breaches.\nThe COVID 19 pandemic could affect the health and availability of our workforce as well as those of the third parties we rely on. While we have not closed our offices, many of our employees, including members of our executive management, have periodically worked remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a number of our employees have contracted COVID-19 requiring them to miss a number of days of work while recovering, which, if it continues, may adversely affect our business operations. If members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to the COVID 19 pandemic, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and/or our operations may be negatively impacted.\nIn the event that government authorities were to enhance current restrictions, our employees who currently are not working from home may no longer be able to access our facilities, including our laboratories and our operations may be further limited or curtailed. An increase in the number of personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. Further, any such enhanced restrictions may also impact the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain and manufacturing efforts and could affect our ability to conduct ongoing and planned clinical trials and preparatory activities. We may also face difficulties in obtaining access to manufacturing slots for our product candidates. For example, three vaccines for COVID-19 were granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA in late 2020 and early 2021, and resultant demand for vaccines and potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or equivalent foreign legislation, may make it more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing slots for the products needed for our clinical trials, which could lead to delays in these trials.\nOur business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans have been and could continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19, and could be adversely impacted by other health epidemics in regions where we have concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause significant disruption in the operations of CROs, CMOs and other third parties and collaborators upon whom we rely. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected multiple countries worldwide, including those where we have planned and ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials. Site initiation and patient enrollment could be delayed or suspended due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic or patients not having a desire to enroll in clinical trials due to concerns regarding COVID-19. In addition, some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols and the ability to conduct follow up visits with treated patients may be limited if patients do not want to participate in follow up visits due to concerns regarding COVID-19 or if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. There may be shortages in the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our product candidates or laboratory supplies for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, in each case, because of ongoing efforts to address the outbreak. We cannot assure that the inability to collect such clinical data would not have an adverse impact on our clinical trial results. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 could be adversely impacted.\nThe response to the COVID-19 pandemic may redirect resources with respect to regulatory matters in a way that would adversely impact our ability to pursue marketing approvals. In addition, we may face impediments to regulatory meetings and potential approvals due to measures intended to limit in-person interactions. Furthermore, third parties, including manufacturers, medical institutions, clinical investigators, CROs and consultants with whom we conduct business, are similarly adjusting their operations and assessing their capacity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. If these third parties continue to experience shutdowns or business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted.\nFurther, COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in global financial markets. Many experts predict that the outbreak will trigger a period of global economic slowdown or a global recession. We are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nCOVID-19 is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, and COVID-19 or another pandemic may result in material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate our business, including:\n\u25cf our ability to successfully launch, commercialize, and generate revenue from DANYELZA and our product candidates, even if approved, may be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, limited hospital access for non-patients, social distancing requirements, and precautionary measures due to COVID-19 have impacted the ability of our sales personnel to interact in-person with customers. In response, we have implemented a virtual launch model, which may adversely affect the ability of our sales professionals to effectively market DANYELZA and our product candidates to physicians, which may have a negative impact on our sales and our market penetration. In addition, in the United States we plan to utilize various programs to help patients afford our products, including patient assistance programs for eligible patients. Market disruption and rising unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased utilization of our patient assistance programs, which could reduce revenues;\n\u25cf delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials, including receiving any required investigational new drug applications, or INDs;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in enrolling and retaining patients in our clinical trials if patients are affected by the virus or are fearful of visiting or traveling to clinical trial sites because of the outbreak;\n\u25cf risk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u25cf manufacturing disruptions;\n\u25cf delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in the transport of clinical trial materials;\n\u25cf changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption of or changes in key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, implementation of virtual monitoring, use of local testing labs, or home delivery of study drugs, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, use of new digital technologies for subject visits or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data;\n\u25cf delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u25cf delays in regulatory approvals for our product candidates due to the FDA focusing on clinical trials related to therapies and vaccines targeting COVID-19;\n\u25cf refusal of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to accept data, including from clinical trials in affected geographies or failure to comply with updated FDA or other regulatory guidance and expectations related to the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf the destabilization of the markets and negative impacts on the healthcare system or regulatory authorities globally could negatively impact our ability to obtain approval to market, market and sell our products, including through the disruption of regulatory activities or health care activities in general;\n\u25cf difficulty accessing the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets, or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions which could affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations;\n\u25cf the potential negative impact on the health of our employees, especially if a significant number of them or any of their family members are impacted or if any of our senior leaders are impacted for an extended period of time;\n\u25cf potential delays in the preparation and submission of applications for regulatory approval of our product candidates, as well as potential interruptions or delays in FDA\u2019s ability to review applications in a timely manner consistent with past practices, which may impact review and approval times;\n\u25cf delays in scheduling manufacturing inspections in connection with BLA approval;\n\u25cf a general decline in business activity; and\n\u25cf a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption.\nThe trading prices for our common stock and the shares of other biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the trading prices for our common stock could continue to experience high volatility. As a result, we may face difficulties raising additional capital through sales of our common stock or any such sales may be on unfavorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nDespite our efforts to manage and mitigate these impacts to our company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of this and any other pandemic, as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects, and the pace of global economic recovery following containment of the spread. In addition, while we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our suppliers, vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions, any material adverse effects on these parties could adversely impact us. The ultimate impact of this and any other pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and the continued spread of COVID-19 may have further adverse impacts on our business, operations, any pending regulatory approvals, supply chain, and financial position, and may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, clinical trials, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nWe have limited experience operating as a commercial company and the marketing and sale of DANYELZA or any future approved products may be unsuccessful or less successful than anticipated.\nWhile we have initiated the commercial launch of DANYELZA in the United States, we have limited experience as a commercial company and there is limited information about our ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies commercializing drugs in the biopharmaceutical industry. To execute our business plan, in addition to successfully marketing and selling DANYELZA, we will need to successfully:\n\u25cf establish and maintain our relationships with healthcare providers who will be treating the patients who may receive our products and any future products;\n\u25cf maintain adequate pricing and reimbursement for DANYELZA and any future products;\n\u25cf gain regulatory authorization for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf develop and maintain successful strategic alliances;\n\u25cf accurately forecast demand for our products and scale manufacturing to meet that demand;\n\u25cf manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to clinical trials, marketing approvals, and commercialization; and\n\u25cf maintain and grow our relationship with MSK as a user of DANYELZA and any future products.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to successfully develop product candidates, commercialize DANYELZA or any future approved products, raise capital, expand our business, or continue our operations.\nThe commercial success of DANYELZA and of any future approved products, will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nThe commercial success of DANYELZA, and of any future approved products, will depend in part on market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments like surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy are well-established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If DANYELZA or any future approved products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of drugs and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of DANYELZA, and of any future product, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u25cf developing processes for the safe administration of our products, including long-term follow-up for all patients who receive the product;\n\u25cf the potential advantages of the product compared to competitive therapies;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-, second- or third-line therapy;\n\u25cf our ability, or the ability of any potential future collaborators, to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf the product\u2019s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u25cf the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient populations to try new therapies, enroll in ongoing clinical trials, and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the requirement for in-patient versus out-patient administration;\n\u25cf availability and amount of coverage and reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors; and\n\u25cf the timing of competitive product introductions and other actions by competitors in the marketplace.\nWe have only recently established our marketing and sales organization and have only limited experience in marketing and sale of biopharmaceutical products. We may not be successful in commercializing DANYELZA or any future approved product unless we are able to maintain and expand our sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market such approved products.\nWe have only recently established our sales and marketing organization and have only limited experience in marketing and sale of biopharmaceutical products. We began small shipments of DANYELZA in February 2021. Other than our commercialization partnerships for DANYELZA and omburtamab covering certain territories outside the United States with SciClone Pharmaceuticals International Ltd, Takeda Israel, Swixx Biopharma AG and Adium Pharma S.A., we are not currently a party to any strategic collaboration that provides us with access to a collaborator\u2019s resources in selling or marketing drugs. To achieve commercial success for any future approved products we must successfully maintain and expand our sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to strategic collaborators and other third parties. We have built our own focused, specialized sales and marketing organization in the United States. We continue to explore selectively establishing partnerships in markets outside the United States to support the commercialization of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval and that can be commercialized with such capabilities, and we are currently initiating the process of building our own sales capabilities in Europe, however, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in our efforts.\nThere are risks involved with both further establishing our own direct sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training even a small sales force can be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any commercial launch of a product candidate. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our drugs on our own after obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf our inability to raise financing necessary to maintain and grow our commercialization infrastructure;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe DANYELZA or any future approved products, in particular in light of current reduced in-person access to medical institutions and personnel and other significant disruptions to the healthcare system and community due to COVID-19;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary drugs to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive drug lines;\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u25cf inability to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and governmental agencies.\nOur revenues from the sale of drugs or the profitability of these revenues to us are likely to be lower from arrangements that we enter into with third parties to perform sales and marketing service (such as with SciClone Pharmaceuticals International Ltd, Takeda Israel, Swixx Biopharma AG and Adium Pharma S.A.) than if we were to market and sell any drugs that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering additional arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We have limited control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our drugs effectively. If we do not maintain and expand our sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we might not be successful in commercializing DANYELZA or any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, if any. In the event that we are unable to effectively deploy our sales organization or distribution strategy on a timely and efficient basis, if at all, the commercialization of DANYELZA or our product candidates, if approved, could be delayed which would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry, and the market for developing antibody-based products in particular, is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our actual and potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations as well as established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized, or less costly than DANYELZA or our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the commercialization of DANYELZA and development of our product candidates and related technologies.\nSpecifically, MacroGenics, Inc. and Daiichi Sankyo Co. are developing antibodies against B7-H3. United Therapeutics Corporation, or United Therapeutics, has commercialized Unituxin (dinutuximab), an antibody against GD2, in the United States. In the first quarter of 2021 United Therapeutics announced that it had discontinued plans to develop Unituxin in R/R NB. During the third quarter of 2020, United Therapeutics discontinued its efforts to investigate Unituxin\u2019s potential activity against adult cancerous tumors, and its efforts to develop a humanized version of Unituxin. In addition, DANYELZA may face competition from dinutuximab beta, a similar antibody product against GD2 developed by Apeiron Biologics AG, or Apeiron, that was approved in Europe in May 2017 to treat high-risk NB and R/R NB. In October 2016, EUSA Pharma (UK) Ltd., or EUSA, announced that it had acquired global commercialization rights to dinutuximab beta, which is currently being commercialized under the name Qarziba\u00ae in Europe. In January 2020, EUSA and BeiGene Ltd., or BeiGene, announced an exclusive collaboration to commercialize Qarziba\u00ae in mainland China and in August 2021 EUSA and BeiGene announced that the China National Medical Products Administration had granted QARZIBA\u00ae (dinutuximab beta) conditional approval for the treatment of high-risk NB and R/R NB. EUSA has previously announced plans to file for registration of dinutuximab beta in the United States in R/R NB.\nWe may not be the first to market even with respect to our approved products such as DANYELZA and that may affect the price or demand for DANYELZA and our product candidates. Additionally, the availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our products. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our products is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our products, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our products for use in limited circumstances. Additionally, a competitor could obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA with respect to such competitor\u2019s product. If such competitor product is determined to be the same product as one of our product candidates, that may prevent us from obtaining approval from the FDA for such product candidate for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances.\nThe market opportunities for DANYELZA and our product candidates, if approved, may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small. If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. Also, the market opportunity for DANYELZA and our product candidates, if approved, may be smaller than we expect.\nOur current target patient population is based on our beliefs and estimates regarding the incidence or prevalence of certain types of cancers that may be addressable by DANYELZA and our product candidates, which are derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research. The total addressable market opportunity for DANYELZA and any other product candidates we may produce, if approved, will ultimately depend upon, among other things, the diagnosis criteria included in the final label for our current and future products for sale for these indications, acceptance by the medical community and patient access, drug pricing, and reimbursement. The number of patients in our targeted commercial markets and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, possibly materially, patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our drug, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nEven if we obtain significant market share for DANYELZA or our product candidates, if approved, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional and broader indications, including use of DANYELZA or our product candidates, if approved, for front-line and third-line therapy.\nDANYELZA is approved only as second line treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in bone and/or bone marrow, and we expect to initially seek approval of our product candidate omburtamab also as second-line therapy for patients who have relapsed from systemic disease. Even if we would seek approval as front-line or third-line therapy for DANYELZA, omburtamab or another product candidate there is no guarantee that they would be approved. In addition, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials prior to gaining approval for front-line or third-line therapy.\nThe timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u25cf the size and nature of the patient population;\n\u25cf the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u25cf the size of the study population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u25cf the proximity of patients to trial sites;\n\u25cf the design of the trial;\n\u25cf our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u25cf competing clinical trials for similar therapies or other new therapeutics not involving our product candidates and or related technologies;\n\u25cf clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and side effects of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u25cf the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will not complete a clinical trial.\nIn addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. We expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Moreover, because our product candidates represent a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to only use conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation, rather than enroll patients in any future clinical trial.\nEven if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates, submit regulatory filings, obtain marketing approvals and delay the launch of our products, upon approval.\nDANYELZA or any current or future product candidates may cause serious adverse events, or SAEs, undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent, delay, or cause the withdrawal of their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences, including death of patients or cause regulatory authorities to require labeling statements, such as boxed warnings. Even after approval, if we, or others, later discover that the drug is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, our ability, or that of any potential future collaborators, to market the drug could be compromised.\nAs with most biological drug products, use of DANYELZA or any current or future product candidates could be associated with undesirable side effects or adverse events which can vary in severity from minor reactions to death and in frequency from infrequent to prevalent. Undesirable side effects or unacceptable toxicities caused by our products or product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials.\nTreatment-related undesirable side effects or adverse events could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial, or could result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately or timely recognized or managed by the treating medical staff, particularly outside of the research institutions that collaborate with us. We expect to have to educate and train medical personnel using our products and product candidates to understand their side effect profiles, both for our planned clinical trials and upon any commercialization of any product candidates when approved such as DANYELZA. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our products or product candidates could result in adverse effects to patients, including death. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nUndesirable side effects caused by DANYELZA or any other product or product candidate could limit the commercial profile of such product or product candidate or result in significant negative consequences such as a more restrictive label or other limitations or restrictions.\nIn clinical studies, DANYELZA has been shown to cause serious infusion reactions including anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, stridor, and hypotension. The most common adverse events were mainly mild and moderate and included infusion-related reaction, pain, tachycardia, vomiting, cough, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, hypertension, fatigue, erythema multiforme, peripheral neuropathy, urticaria, pyrexia, headache, edema, anxiety, localized edema and irritability. DANYELZA has been approved with a boxed warning for serious infusion reactions and neurotoxicity.\nClinical trials of our product candidates must be conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that our clinical trials, or those of any potential future collaborator, may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, such as for DANYELZA in the US, a product candidate receives marketing approval and we, or others, discover that the drug is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, including during any long-term follow-up observation period recommended or required for patients who receive treatment using our products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product or seize the product;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may be required to recall the product, change the way such product is administered to patients or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may (such as for DANYELZA) narrow the indications for use or require additional warnings in the labeling, such as a boxed warning or a contraindication, or impose distribution or use restrictions;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u25cf the drug may become less competitive; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of the foregoing could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of DANYELZA or a particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects, and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, ability to raise additional financing or the market price of our common stock.\nThe outcome of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and the results of our clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and if an adverse safety issue, clinical hold or other adverse finding occurs in one or more of our clinical trials of our lead product candidates, such event could adversely affect our other clinical trials of our lead product candidates.\nSuccess in pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials does not mean that future larger registration clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the outcome of pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of larger, later-stage clinical trials.\nFrom time to time, we may publish or report interim or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Interim or preliminary data from clinical trials that we may conduct may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Interim or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the interim or preliminary data. As a result, interim or preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a drug and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We may be unable to design and conduct a clinical trial to support marketing approval. Further, if our product candidates are found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to obtain marketing approval for them and our business would be harmed. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in pre-clinical studies and earlier clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants.\nWe do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain marketing approval to market our product candidates. We have multiple clinical trials of our lead product candidates currently ongoing. In the event that an adverse safety issue, clinical hold or other adverse finding occurs in one or more of our clinical trials of our lead product candidates, such event could adversely affect our other clinical trials of our lead product candidates. We have received clinical holds on our IND applications for certain of our product candidates in the past and there is no assurance that we will not be subject to additional clinical holds in the future, which may ultimately delay or otherwise adversely affect the clinical development of our product candidates. Survival and safety data from Study 03-133 will form the primary basis for our planned resubmission of the BLA for omburtamab, which we will compare with data from an external cohort comprising data from the Central German Childhood Cancer Registry, or CGCCR, database. Furthermore, interim efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic data from Study 101 will support the BLA resubmission. If the results of this study fail to demonstrate comparability to the satisfaction of the FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities, this may lead to a delay in the approval process for omburtamab. While we aim for a full approval of omburtamab, we do not know what an approval of omburtamab (if\napproved) will become subject to in terms of postmarketing requirements and commitments, including confirmatory study requirements.\nFurther, our product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their primary endpoints in Phase 3 clinical trials or other pivotal trials. The FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials or conclude that we do not have adequate manufacturing controls or quality systems. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for a pivotal clinical trial that has the potential to result in approval by the FDA or another regulatory authority. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may also approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that we believe would be necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in pre-clinical studies and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication. There is no assurance that the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities will consider our present or future clinical trials to be sufficient to serve as the basis for approval of one of our product candidates for any indication. The FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities retain broad discretion in evaluating the results of our clinical trials and in determining whether the results demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials of a product candidate than we expect prior to its approval, we will need substantial additional funds and there is no assurance that the results of any such additional clinical trials will be sufficient for approval.\nResearch and development of biopharmaceutical products is inherently risky. We may not be successful in our efforts to create a pipeline of product candidates and develop commercially successful products. If we fail to develop additional product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be limited.\nOther than DANYELZA, the product candidates and related technologies we have licensed have not yet led, and may never lead, to approved products. Further, our only approved product DANYELZA was only recently approved and launched in the United States and hence its commercial potential cannot be judged with accuracy at this point in time. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, obtaining regulatory approvals and commercializing our product candidates will require substantial additional funding and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in medical product development. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development involves significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval, and/or become commercially viable. We cannot provide you any assurance that we will be able to successfully advance any of these additional product candidates through the development process. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development or commercialization for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf we may not be successful in identifying additional product candidates;\n\u25cf we may not be able to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\n\u25cf our product candidates may not succeed in pre-clinical or clinical testing;\n\u25cf a product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u25cf competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u25cf product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u25cf the market for a product candidate may change so that the continued development of that product candidate is no longer reasonable;\n\u25cf a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u25cf a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors, if applicable.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. As for DANYELZA, which has been approved by the FDA for the United States market, even if we receive approval to market our product candidates from the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory bodies, whether for the treatment of cancers or other diseases, no assurance can be given you that any such product candidates will be successfully commercialized, widely accepted in the marketplace or more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nWe have entered into several agreements with MSK that are important to our business. We may also form or seek other collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future but may not realize the benefits of such collaborations or strategic alliances. If we are unable to enter into future collaborations, or if such collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe currently have in place several agreements with MSK, including the MSK License, the MSK CD33 License, and the SADA License Agreement, which are important to us, and we may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. In addition, we anticipate that MSK, due to patients obtaining treatment at the institution, may become a major source for the distribution and administration of DANYELZA. Any disruption of our relationship with MSK could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any of these relationships may require us to incur other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy or because the commercial potential is difficult to predict.\nFurther, arrangements with third parties, such as our arrangement with MSK or our current or potential future collaborations we may enter into involving our product candidates, are subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\u25cf such third parties or any current or potential future collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration;\n\u25cf such third parties or any current or potential future collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products or product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u25cf such third parties or any current or potential future collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf such third parties or any current or potential future collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;\n\u25cf product candidates discovered through such arrangements or any potential future collaborations with us may be viewed by such third parties or any potential future collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause such third parties or collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our products or product candidates;\n\u25cf such third party or any current tor potential future collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u25cf such third parties or any current or potential future collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between us and such third party or any current or potential future collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u25cf such third parties or any current or potential future collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf such arrangements or any current or potential future collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product or product candidate; and\n\u25cf such third parties or any current or potential future collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nAs a result, if we are unable to maintain current arrangements or collaborations or enter into and maintain future arrangements and collaborations, or if such arrangements or collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected. If we enter into certain arrangements or collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our products or product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates in certain territories for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we or third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, or contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities may involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by us or third parties, such as CROs and CMOs. The use of Iodine-131, Iodine-124 and Lutetium-177-labeled antibody treatments involves the inherent risk of exposure from beta ray\nemissions, which can alter or harm healthy cells in the body. We and such third parties are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States and Europe governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our and such third-parties\u2019 procedures for using, handling, storing, and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state, or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. We currently maintain insurance coverage for injuries resulting from the hazardous materials we use; however, future claims may exceed the amount of our coverage. Also, we do not have insurance coverage for pollution cleanup and removal. Currently the costs of complying with such federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations are not significant, and consist primarily of waste disposal expenses. However, they could become expensive, and current or future environmental laws or regulations may impair our research, development, production and commercialization efforts.\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property which could adversely impact our business.\nOur business is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could hinder our ability to operate. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our business.\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce or deceive employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including patient, clinical trial and corporate information) or intellectual property, disrupt our business, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented commercially reasonable systems and processes to thwart hackers and otherwise protect our data and systems, but the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our business or systems in the future. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and such efforts may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our operations and systems. Any significant disruption to our systems could adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party\u2019s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk and divert internal resources to respond to such an event, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing services in connection with our business operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as natural disasters, cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\nRisks related to our dependence on third parties\nThird parties have sponsored most clinical trials of DANYELZA and omburtamab so far, and our ability to influence the design and conduct of such clinical trials has been limited. We have incurred significant expenses and are obligated to make significant payments in the future with respect to such clinical trials. We plan to assume control over the clinical and regulatory development of such product candidates, including obtaining sponsorship of existing INDs or filing new company-sponsored INDs, which will entail substantial additional expenses and may be subject to delay. Any failure by a third party to meet its obligations with respect to the clinical and regulatory development of our product candidates may delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and result in liability for our company.\nWe have sponsored only a limited number of clinical trials relating to DANYELZA and omburtamab. Instead, faculty members at our third-party research institution collaborators, or those institutions themselves, have sponsored most of the clinical trials relating to these product candidates, in each case, under their own INDs. We have incurred significant expenses and are obligated to make significant payments in the future with respect to such clinical trials. To date, we have assumed control of only a limited number of such clinical trials and plan to assume control of the overall clinical and regulatory development of DANYELZA and omburtamab for future clinical trials and obtain sponsorship of the INDs or file new company-sponsored INDs, all of which will cause us to incur substantial additional expenses and may be subject to delay. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, sponsorship of INDs or in filing new company-sponsored INDs for DANYELZA or omburtamab or any other product candidates we determine to advance could negatively affect the timing of our potential future clinical trials. Such an impact on timing could increase research and development costs and could delay or prevent obtaining regulatory approval for our most advanced product candidates, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, even in the event that the IND sponsorship is obtained for existing and new INDs, we did not control the design or conduct of the previous trials. It is possible that the FDA will not accept these previous trials as providing adequate support for future clinical trials, whether controlled by us or third parties, for any reason, including the safety, purity, and potency of the product candidate, the degree of product characterization, elements of the design or execution of the previous trials or safety concerns, or other trial results. We may also be subject to liabilities arising from any treatment-related injuries or adverse effects in patients enrolled in these previous trials. As a result, we may be subject to unforeseen third-party claims and delays in our potential future clinical trials. We may also be required to repeat in whole or in part clinical trials previously conducted by our third-party research institution collaborators, which will be expensive and delay the submission and licensure or other regulatory approvals with respect to any of our product candidates. Any such delay or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, we have so far been dependent on contractual arrangements with our third-party research institution collaborators and will continue to be until we assume control. Such arrangements provide us certain information rights with respect to the previous trials, including access to and the ability to use and reference the data, including for our own regulatory filings, resulting from the previous trials. However, if the data prove to be inadequate compared to the first-hand knowledge we might have gained had the completed trials been corporate-sponsored trials, then our ability to design and conduct our planned corporate-sponsored clinical trials may be adversely affected. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with the sufficiency of our right to reference the pre-clinical, manufacturing, or clinical data generated by these prior investigator-sponsored trials, or our interpretation of pre-clinical, manufacturing, or clinical data from these clinical trials. Moreover, the FDA may require us to obtain and submit additional pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing, clinical, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data before we may begin our planned trials and/or may not accept such additional data as adequate to begin our planned trials.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with MSK, universities, medical institutions, CROs, strategic partners, and others. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance\non third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices, or GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional non-clinical or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with biologic product produced under cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. We may also rely on investigator-reported interim data in making business decisions. Independent review of the data could fail to confirm the investigator reported interim data, which may lead to revisions in disclosed clinical trial results in the future. Any such revisions that reveal more negative data than previously disclosed investigator-reported interim data could have an adverse impact on our business prospects and the trading price of our common stock. Such revisions could also reduce investor confidence in investigator-reported interim data that we disclose in the future.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and delays and requires management time and focus. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges in the future or that these challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture DANYELZA for commercial supplies and our product candidates for our ongoing and planned pre-clinical studies and clinical studies. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of DANYELZA or our product candidates, or fail to do so at acceptable quantities, quality levels or prices or fail to maintain adequate compliance with CMC guidelines of the FDA.\nWe do not currently own any facility that may be used as commercial or clinical-scale manufacturing and processing facility and we rely on outside vendors to manufacture DANYELZA for commercial supply and for supplies and processing of our product candidates for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials under the guidance of our management team. Omburtamab and our other product candidates have only been manufactured or processed on a limited basis and we may not be able to continue doing so for omburtamab or any of our product candidates. Our manufacturing process may be more difficult or expensive than the approaches currently in use. We may make changes as we work to optimize the manufacturing process, and we cannot be sure that even minor changes in the process will not result in significantly different products that may not be as safe and effective as any product candidates deployed by our third-party research institution collaborators.\nTo date, we have obtained the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of DANYELZA and omburtamab from a limited number of third-party manufacturers. We have engaged a separate third-party manufacturer to conduct fill-and-finish and labeling services, as well as for the storage and distribution of DANYELZA and omburtamab to clinical sites. We do not have a long-term supply agreement with any of these third-party API manufacturers, and we purchase our required drug supplies on a purchase order basis.\nWe rely also on third-party manufacturers and third-party collaborators for the manufacture of DANYELZA for commercial supply and we expect this also to be the case for any of our product candidates for which we or any of our\npotential future collaborators obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms.\nWe are highly dependent on our current third-party drug substance manufacturer of omburtamab, EMD/Merck, since this manufacturing process uses a hybridoma cell line in a relatively small scale (200 litres) cGMP manufacturing process. Many manufacturers refuse to allow hybridoma cell lines to be used in their facilities due to the risk of contamination and the relatively small scale of the cGMP system may render a collaboration with us less attractive from a third party\u2019s commercial point of view.\nEven if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u25cf the number of potential manufacturers is limited, we would need to qualify any new manufacturers, our BLA submissions would need to be amended and ultimately the FDA must approve any new manufacturers. This approval would require new testing and cGMP, compliance inspections by the FDA. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products;\n\u25cf our third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any, and their ability to meet our manufacturing requirements may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf our third-party manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures and other logistical support requirements appropriately;\n\u25cf our third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed, according to our schedule or specifications, or at all, may not devote sufficient resources to our product candidates, may give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates, or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store, and distribute our products;\n\u25cf the risk of cross-contamination if more than one product is manufactured at our third-party manufacturer\u2019s production facilities;\n\u25cf our third-party manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these and or any other applicable regulations and standards;\n\u25cf we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our products;\n\u25cf our third-party manufacturers could breach, terminate or not renew their agreement with us at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u25cf clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the raw materials and components used to manufacture and process our product candidates, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier, may not be available or may not be suitable or acceptable for use due to material or component defects;\n\u25cf the possible mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified;\n\u25cf the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u25cf the possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales. Our third-party manufacturers and critical reagent suppliers may be subject to inclement weather, as well as natural or man-made disasters; and\n\u25cf our third-party manufacturers may have unacceptable or inconsistent product quality success rates and yields and may have inadequate quality control systems.\nEach of these risks could delay or prevent the completion of our clinical trials, could delay any additional BLA submissions or the approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA, result in higher costs or adversely impact commercialization of our product candidates. For example, during 2018 we experienced a shortage in the supply of Iodine-131, one of the components of our 131I-omburtamab product candidate, from our single source supplier. We have established a relationship with an additional supplier which we believe will be able to provide us with adequate supplies of Iodine-131. Any such shortages in the supply of such raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of our clinical trials or the approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA, result in higher costs or adversely impact commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, we will rely on third parties to perform certain specification tests on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately done and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm and the FDA could place significant restrictions on our company until deficiencies are remedied.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture DANYELZA and our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections conducted after submittal of the BLA to the FDA. We do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing both active drug substances and finished drug products. DANYELZA and any product candidates that we may develop may compete with product candidates of other companies for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our drugs and harm our business and results of operations.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could adversely affect our commercialization of approved products, such as DANYELZA, and delay clinical development or marketing approval of other product candidates. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of DANYELZA and omburtamab and we only currently use a different single third-party manufacturer for fill-and-finish services for DANYELZA and omburtamab. If our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace those manufacturers and we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. We have been informed that the FDA plans to visit and inspect the site of EMD Millipore Corporation (now part of the Merck KGaA group of companies), or EMD/Merck, in Martillac, France, where the omburtamab drug substance is manufactured and Vela Labs, GmbH, in Austria where an analytical release test of omburtamab drug substance is performed. We estimate that the FDA inspection may occur in the fourth quarter of 2022 assuming the FDA accepts the omburtamab BLA submission. However, if the FDA is not able to timely conduct an inspection for any reason, including due to COVID-19 travel restrictions or otherwise, there may be adverse consequences to the approval process, and we may not obtain BLA approval on a timely basis or at all. Delays in the approval process or our inability to obtain approval for any reason for omburtamab or any other product candidate would have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. The FDA may also decide to inspect the fill and finish site at Patheon/Thermo Fisher in Ferentino, Italy, which may cause similar risks. We also expect EMA to require an inspection of the manufacturing facilities for omburtamab due to our MAA submission for omburtamab. If the EMA is unable to conclude that these manufacturing facilities are in compliance with cGMP there may be adverse consequences to the approval process, and we may not obtain a MA for omburtamab in Europe on a timely basis or at all. In addition, if the EMA is not able to timely conduct an inspection for any reason, including due to COVID 19 travel restrictions or otherwise, there may be adverse consequences to the approval process, and we may not obtain MAA approval on a timely basis or at all.\nWe are and will continue to rely in significant part on outside scientists and their third-party research institutions for research and development and early clinical testing of our product candidates. These scientists and institutions may have other commitments or conflicts of interest, which could limit our access to their expertise and adversely affect the timing of the IND filings and our ability to conduct future planned clinical trials.\nWe currently have limited internal research and development capabilities and we have not and are not currently conducting any independent clinical trials. Therefore, we currently rely on third-party research institutions for both capabilities.\nCurrently, MSK is conducting clinical trials to address pediatric high-risk NB and relapsed osteosarcoma using DANYELZA. We are also conducting clinical trials at MSK for CNS/LM from NB, DIPG and DSRCT for our omburtamab product candidate and GD2 positive tumors for our nivatrotamab product candidate. Under the terms of the MCTA, we are obligated to pay for costs associated with these clinical trials.\nWe have agreed to fund certain research and development costs under both the MSK License, the MSK CD33 License and the SADA License Agreement. However, the research we have agreed to fund constitutes only a small portion of the overall research of MSK. Other research being conducted by MSK may receive higher priority than research on the programs we may fund.\nThe outside scientists who conduct the clinical testing of DANYELZA and our other current product candidates, and who conduct the research and development upon which our product candidate pipeline depends, are not our employees; rather they serve as either independent contractors or the primary investigators under research and other agreements that we have entered into with MSK. Such scientists and collaborators may have other commitments that would limit their availability to us. Although our scientific advisors generally agree not to do competing work, if an actual or potential conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for MSK or another entity arises, we may lose their services. These factors could adversely affect the timing of our IND filings and our ability to conduct future planned clinical trials. It is also possible that some of our valuable proprietary knowledge may become publicly known through these scientific advisors if they breach their confidentiality agreements with us, which would cause competitive harm to, and have a material adverse effect on, our business.\nOur existing agreements with MSK may be subject to termination by MSK upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. If MSK terminates the MSK License, the MSK CD33 License, the SADA License Agreement or its other agreements with us, commercialization of any approved product, such as DANYELZA, or the research and development of the relevant product candidates would be suspended, and we would vnot be able to research, develop, and license our existing and future product candidates as currently contemplated. We may be required to devote additional resources to the development of our product candidates or seek a new collaboration partner, and the terms of any additional collaborations or other arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us. Switching or adding third parties to conduct our clinical trial would involve substantial costs and delays and require extensive management time and focus, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nDANYELZA and our product candidates are biologics and the manufacture of DANYELZA and our product candidates is complex. We, or any of our third-party manufacturers, may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process development or scaling-up of our manufacturing capabilities. For some reagents, equipment, and materials, we rely or may rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors. Such difficulties may result in an inadequate supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.\nDANYELZA and our product candidates are biologics and the process of manufacturing them is complex, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. As a result of the complexities, the cost to manufacture biologics is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing process for biologics is less reliable and is more difficult to reproduce. In addition, manufacturing of DANYELZA and our product candidates require many reagents, which are substances used in our manufacturing processes to bring about chemical or biological reactions, and other specialty materials and equipment, some of which are manufactured or supplied by small companies\nwith limited resources and experience to support commercial biologics production. Our manufacturing process may be susceptible to product loss or failure due to interruptions in the manufacturing process variability in product characteristics, quality control, contamination, equipment or reagent failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, product testing, vendor or operator error, availability of qualified personnel, logistics and shipping as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. No assurance can be given that any stability failures or other issues relating to the manufacture of DANYELZA or our product candidates will not occur in the future.\nFurther, as product candidates are developed through pre-clinical to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials. Moreover, as we develop and/or scale-up our manufacturing process, we expect that we will need to obtain rights to and supplies of certain materials and equipment to be used as part of that process. We may not be able to obtain rights to such materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, the manufacturing process for any products that we may develop is subject to FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authority approval process, and we will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. If we, or our CMOs, are unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to commercialize such products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that either we or our CMOs will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product, or to meet potential future demand. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidate, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Although we are working to develop commercially viable processes, our manufacturing capabilities could be affected by cost-overruns, unexpected delays, equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our manufacturing strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business. We may ultimately be unable to, among other things, develop a manufacturing process and distribution network that will, reduce the cost of goods for our product candidates to levels that will allow for an attractive return on investment if and when those product candidates are commercialized.\nWe have entered into strategic collaborations for the development, marketing and commercialization of DANYELZA and omburtamab in certain jurisdictions and may do so also in the future for all or some of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, or if we are unable to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter or delay our development and commercialization plans.\nAs we further develop our lead product candidates and following potential approval, commercialize our products, we may build a commercial infrastructure with the capability to directly market it to a variety of markets and territories. In November 2020, we entered into an exclusive license and distribution agreement for DANYELZA and omburtamab with Takeda Israel, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited covering the State of Israel, West Bank and Gaza Strip. In December 2020, we entered into a distribution agreement for DANYELZA and omburtamab with Swixx BioPharma AG for the Eastern European territories Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia. In December 2020, we entered into a license agreement for DANYELZA and omburtamab with SciClone Pharmaceuticals International Ltd., or SciClone, for Greater China, including Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Finally, in May 2021, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Adium Pharma S.A., or Adium,\nfor Latin America. We may enter into further strategic collaborations for the development, marketing and commercialization of all or some of our product candidates. Our current and future potential collaborators for any collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. We would face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for any further collaborations will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. We have and will for any future collaborations likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development, marketing and/or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our current and future potential collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. In addition, our current collaborators have and any future collaborators may have, the right to abandon research or development projects and terminate applicable agreements, including funding obligations, prior to or upon the expiration of the agreed upon terms.\nOur current and any future potential collaborations involving our product candidates pose risks to us, including the following:\n\u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development, marketing and/or commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development, marketing or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, drugs that compete directly or indirectly with our drugs or product candidates;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more drugs may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such drug or drugs;\n\u25cf disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf we may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in any collaboration arrangement that we enter into, such as if we undergo a change of control;\n\u25cf we may be restricted under then-existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators;\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development, marketing and/or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u25cf collaborators may learn about our discoveries, data, proprietary information, trade secrets, or compounds and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future; and\n\u25cf the number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to potential future collaborators or acquirers.\nOur current and any future collaboration agreements, if any, may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all.\nWe may not be able to negotiate additional collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, if and when we seek to enter into collaborations. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate revenue from sales of drugs.\nCoverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance. If there is not sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our products, it is less likely that our products will be widely used.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our products, if approved, such as DANYELZA, will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will reimburse and establish payment levels and, in some cases, utilization management strategies, such as tiered formularies and prior authorization. To date, although a number of third party providers have established coverage policies and provided reimbursement for DANYELZA, no third-party provider has established coverage policies or provided reimbursement for any of our other product candidates and we cannot assure you that coverage and reimbursement will be readily available for DANYELZA or any products that we develop or that the reimbursement level will be adequate to allow us to operate profitably. Also, we cannot be certain that coverage and reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products. If coverage and reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, or if the coverage and reimbursement amount is inadequate, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our approved products.\nRisks related to government regulation; market approval and other legal compliance matters\nIn October 2020 we received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding our BLA for omburtamab. We plan to resubmit the BLA. The FDA retains discretion to decide again not to file our BLA for omburtamab which could have a material adverse impact on our development and approval process for omburtamab.\nWe initiated submission of a BLA for omburtamab in June 2020 under the FDA\u2019s rolling review process and completed the submission in August 2020. In October 2020 we received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding the BLA for omburtamab. The reason for the FDA\u2019s Refusal to File was that upon preliminary review, the FDA determined that certain parts of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) Module and the Clinical Module of the BLA required further detail. Among other things, the FDA requested that detailed validation data be included in the CMC Module, that clinical study data and external control data be reanalyzed using a propensity score adjusted analysis for important baseline characteristics, such as prior receipt of irradiation, and that further supportive evidence in the form\nof direct anti-tumor effect be included in the Clinical Module. We have been working closely with the FDA to resolve these issues and have discussed the adequacy of the external control reanalysis and supporting data to demonstrate direct anti-tumor effect for a BLA resubmission. We are in the process of preparing a resubmission of the BLA for omburtamab by the end of the first quarter of 2022.\nWe plan to commercialize omburtamab as soon as possible after obtaining FDA approval, if such approval occurs. However, there is no assurance that the FDA will accept our proposal and our data as sufficient to allow the BLA resubmission. In addition, the FDA may raise additional issues and pose questions to us that may delay the resubmission of our BLA for omburtamab, the filing of the BLA for omburtamab by the FDA, the approval process and the ultimate issuance of any Marketing Authorization for omburtamab. We may not be able to provide a satisfactory or a timely response to FDA questions or we may not be able to timely gather the required data, or at all, to prepare our BLA submission for omburtamab as planned. If we are unable to address all questions or concerns the FDA has raised or may raise or if we do not have timely access to the data required for the preparations of the BLA, we may not be able to timely submit our BLA and ultimately receive a Marketing Authorization for omburtamab. If the FDA files the BLA and we are delayed or unable to provide data in response to FDA information requests, the PDUFA date for our BLA may be extended or we may receive a Complete Response Letter, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe FDA retains discretion to decide again not to review our BLA for omburtamab. No assurance can be given that we would be able to satisfactorily or timely answer or resolve all the questions and issues the FDA may pose.\nIn addition, while we are currently pursuing a full approval for our BLA for omburtamab, in the event the FDA finds our data insufficient to support such full approval, it is possible that the FDA would consider whether our clinical data is sufficient for a potential accelerated approval. However, the FDA may not find our data sufficient to support either a full approval or an accelerated approval. Even if the FDA were to find our clinical data sufficient to support an accelerated approval, we would need to conduct a post-marketing study to confirm the clinical benefit of omburtamab. The FDA may also impose other conditions as a result of any accelerated or full approval which we may not be able to satisfy. Any delay or inability to obtain approval for our BLA for omburtamab would materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from commercialization of omburtamab, which would likely result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price. This could also adversely affect the development and approval process for our other product candidates. We can provide no assurance that the FDA will agree with our proposal or that we will be able to resubmit the BLA as planned or at all or that we will ultimately be able to obtain FDA approval for omburtamab.\nAdditionally, as part of the FDA approval process, the FDA requires an inspection of the manufacturing facilities for omburtamab. If the FDA is unable to conclude that these manufacturing facilities are in substantial compliance with cGMP there may be adverse consequences to the approval process, and we may not obtain BLA approval on a timely basis or at all. We estimate that the FDA inspection may occur in the fourth quarter of 2022 assuming the FDA accepts the omburtamab BLA for filing, however, if the FDA is not able to timely conduct an inspection for any reason including due to COVID-19 travel restrictions or otherwise, there may be adverse consequences to the approval process, and we may not obtain BLA approval on a timely basis or at all.\nWe expect EMA to require an inspection of the manufacturing facilities for omburtamab due to our MAA submission for omburtamab. If the EMA is unable to conclude that these manufacturing facilities are in substantial compliance with cGMP there may be adverse consequences to the approval process, and we may not obtain a MA for omburtamab in Europe on a timely basis or at all. In addition, if the EMA is not able to timely conduct an inspection for any reason including due to COVID-19 travel restrictions or otherwise, there may be adverse consequences to the approval process, and we may not obtain MA approval on a timely basis or at all. Delays in the approval process or our inability to obtain approval for any reason for omburtamab or any other product candidate would have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEven if we complete the necessary non-clinical studies and clinical trials, the FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy, time-consuming, and inherently unpredictable, and we or any of our potential future collaborators may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval, if any, for the commercialization of our product candidates. To date, we have only obtained regulatory approval to market DANYELZA in the United States for relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in bone and/or bone marrow. We cannot predict when or if, and in which other territories, we, or any of our potential future collaborators, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize a product or product candidate.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing, and distribution of drug products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. Even if we complete the necessary pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, we will not be permitted to market any biological drug product in the United States until we receive a Biologics License from the FDA as we did for DANYELZA for relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in bone and/or bone marrow. We intend to conduct additional clinical trials in the United States and Europe. We intend to discuss with the FDA submission of BLAs for respective approval of DANYELZA and omburtamab as treatments for additional indications that currently lack FDA-approved treatments.\nThe FDA standard for regular approval of a BLA generally requires two well-controlled Phase 3 studies or one large and robust, well-controlled Phase 3 study in the patient population being studied that provides substantial evidence that a biologic is safe, pure and potent. Phase 3 clinical studies typically involve hundreds of patients, have significant costs and take years to complete. However, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug or biologic may be subject to withdrawal procedures by the FDA that are more accelerated than those available for regular approvals. The FDA may not agree with our accelerated approval strategy with respect to omburtamab. The FDA may ultimately require one or multiple Phase 3 clinical trials prior to approval of omburtamab or other product candidates.\nWe have some, but only limited, experience in completing a submission of a BLA to the FDA, or similar approval submissions to comparable foreign authorities. A BLA must include extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe, pure, and potent for each desired indication. The BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls for the product, and the manufacturing facilities must complete a successful pre-license inspection. We expect the novel nature of our product candidates to create further challenges in obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA may also require a panel of experts, referred to as an Advisory Committee, to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support licensure. The opinion of the Advisory Committee, although not binding, may have a significant impact on our ability to obtain licensure of the product candidates based on the completed clinical trials. Accordingly, the regulatory approval pathway for our product candidates may be uncertain, complex, expensive, and lengthy, and approval may not be obtained.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. It may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities have substantial discretion and may determine that our product candidates are not safe and effective, only\nmoderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nAny marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nIn addition, clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delays or failures related to:\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory approval to begin a trial, if applicable;\n\u25cf the availability of financial resources to begin and complete the planned trials;\n\u25cf reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf obtaining approval at each clinical trial site by an Institutional Review Board or IRB;\n\u25cf recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial in a timely manner;\n\u25cf having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf clinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol, not complying with GCPs, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf addressing any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u25cf addressing any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u25cf adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf manufacturing qualified materials under cGMPs for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; or\n\u25cf inspection of clinical trial sites and manufacturing facilities by regulatory authorities.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors. See the risk factor above \u201c-The market opportunities for DANYELZA and our product candidates may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small. If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. Also, the market opportunity for DANYELZA and our product candidates may be smaller than we expect.\u201d for additional information on risks related to patient enrollment. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs for the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, the Data Monitoring Committee for such trial, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate potential future product revenue will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\nOur third-party research institution collaborators may also experience similar difficulties in completing ongoing clinical trials and conducting future clinical trials of product candidates. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates, including omburtamab, could fail to receive marketing approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u25cf we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA or other submission or to obtain marketing approval in the United States, the EU or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve any companion diagnostics that may be required in connection with approval of our therapeutic product candidates; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain marketing approval to market omburtamab or any of our other product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. In addition, changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment or promulgation of additional statutes, regulations or guidance or changes in regulatory review for each submitted drug application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of other studies and testing. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we, or any collaborators we may have in the future, ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved drug not commercially viable.\nAny delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability or that of any collaborators we may have to generate revenue from the particular product candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nThe EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, may disagree with our regulatory plans, including our plans to seek conditional marketing authorization, and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval of DANYELZA, omburtamab or our product candidates, which would prevent DANYELZA, omburtamab or our product candidates from being marketed abroad. Any approval we are granted for our product candidates in the United States, such as the approval of DANYELZA, would not assure approval of our product candidates in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell our drugs in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we, and any collaborators we may have in the future, must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements.\nOn April 27, 2021 we submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency for omburtamab for the treatment of pediatric patients with CNS/leptomeningeal metastasis from neuroblastoma.\nThe approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process outside of the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, it is required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before the drug can be approved for sale in that country. We, and any collaborators we may have in the future, may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside of the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA, such as the approval of DANYELZA for relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in bone and/or bone marrow, does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside of the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA.\nAs part of its marketing authorization process, the EMA may grant marketing authorizations on the basis of less complete data than is normally required, when, for certain categories of medicinal products, doing so may meet unmet medical needs of patients and serve the interest of public health. In such cases, it is possible for the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, to recommend the granting of a marketing authorization, subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually, which is referred to as a conditional marketing authorization. This may apply to medicinal products for human use that fall under the jurisdiction of the EMA, including those that aim at the treatment, the prevention, or the medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases and those designated as orphan medicinal products.\nA conditional marketing authorization may be granted when the CHMP finds that, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, all the following requirements are met:\n\u25cf the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is positive;\n\u25cf it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data;\n\u25cf unmet medical needs will be fulfilled; and\n\u25cf the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.\nThe granting of a conditional marketing authorization is restricted to situations in which only the clinical part of the application is not yet fully complete. Incomplete non-clinical or quality data may only be accepted if duly justified and only in the case of a product intended to be used in emergency situations in response to public-health threats.\nConditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, on a renewable basis. The holder will be required to complete ongoing studies or to conduct new studies with a view to confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. In addition, specific obligations may be imposed in relation to the collection of pharmacovigilance data.\nThe granting of a conditional marketing authorization will allow medicines to reach patients with unmet medical needs earlier than might otherwise be the case and will ensure that additional data on a product are generated, submitted, assessed and acted upon. Although we may seek a conditional marketing authorization for one or more of our product candidates by the EMA, the EMA or CHMP may ultimately not agree that the requirements for such conditional marketing authorization have been satisfied.\nOur clinical trial results may also not support approval, whether accelerated approval, conditional marketing authorizations, or regular approval. The results of pre-clinical and clinical studies may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. In addition, our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n\u25cf we may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates\u2019 risk-benefit ratios for their proposed indications are acceptable;\n\u25cf the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u25cf we may be unable to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh their safety risks;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to support the submission of a BLA, MAA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the EU or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, our own manufacturing facilities, or a third-party manufacturer\u2019s facilities with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates would significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may seek Breakthrough Therapy Designation, or BTD, for one or more of our product candidates. We may not receive such designation, and even if we do, such designation may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nBTD is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases when \u201cpreliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.\u201d The designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy provides potential benefits that\ninclude more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support approval; more frequent written correspondence from FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers; intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1; organizational commitment involving senior managers; and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.\nIn June 2017, 131I-omburtamab received BTD for the treatment of pediatric patients with R/R NB who have CNS/LM from NB. We may seek BTD for some or all of our other product candidates, but we may never receive such BTD, or, if received, the development of our product candidates may not be expedited or benefited by such designation. BTD does not change the standards for product approval.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Even if we receive BTD, the receipt of such designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nOur product candidates may not be able to obtain or maintain Orphan Drug Designation, or ODD, or Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, or RPDD.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In September 2021 the FDA granted RPDD for 177Lu-omburtamab-DTPA for the treatment of medulloblastoma. In July 2021, the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation, or OMPD, for 177Lu-omburtamab-DTPA for the treatment of medulloblastoma. In September 2020, the FDA granted ODD and RPDD to nivatrotamab for the treatment of neuroblastoma. In November 2018, the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation, or OMPD, for naxitamab for the treatment of NB. In February 2017, the European Commission granted OMPD to omburtamab for the treatment of NB. In August 2016, the FDA granted ODD to 131I-omburtamab for the treatment of NB. In 2013, the FDA granted ODD to DANYELZA for the treatment of NB.\nIn the United States, ODD entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in the United States provides that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances. The corresponding exclusivity period is 10 years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for ODD or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nThe Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program, or PRV Program, is intended to incentivize pharmaceutical sponsors to develop drugs for rare pediatric diseases. A sponsor who obtains approval of a BLA for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a PRV, under this program, which may be redeemed by the owner of such PRV to obtain priority review for a marketing application. A PRV is fully transferrable and can be sold to any sponsor, who in turn can redeem the PRV for priority review of a marketing application in six months, compared to the standard timeframe of approximately 10 months.\nA drug that receives RPDD before September 30, 2024, will continue to be eligible for a PRV if the drug is approved by the FDA before September 30, 2026.\nEven if our product candidates obtain ODD or RPDD in the future, they may not be able to obtain or maintain such status or the associated benefits. We may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of any product candidate that has obtained ODD for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if we, or any future collaborators, obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care or the manufacturer of the product with orphan exclusivity is unable to maintain sufficient product quantity. ODD neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nEven if we, or any collaborators we may have in the future, obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our drugs could require substantial expenditure of resources and may limit how we, or they, manufacture and market our drugs, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nOnce marketing approval has been granted, such as for DANYELZA in the United States, an approved drug and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation. The accelerated approval of DANYELZA is subject to certain postmarketing requirements and commitments, including a confirmatory postmarketing trial of clinical benefit, that must be completed in order to convert the BLA to full approval and prevent withdrawal of the license by FDA. The confirmatory postmarketing clinical trial required by the FDA to verify and to further characterize the clinical benefit is our ongoing Study 201, which will enroll a minimum of 80 patients and report overall rate of response, or ORR, duration of response, or DOR, progression free survival, or PFS, or overall survival, or OS. The ORR is the primary endpoint for the study, DOR is the secondary endpoint, PFS and OS are secondary endpoints in long-term follow up. As of January 1, 2022 we have enrolled 73 patients and we anticipate completing the study no later than March 31, 2027. Other requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. We, and any collaborators we may have in the future, must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we or they obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the drug\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we, and any collaborators we may have in the future, may not be able to promote any drugs we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a drug. For example, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which could include requirements for a restricted distribution system. Manufacturers of approved drugs and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are also required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We, our contract manufacturers, our future collaborators and their contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, assuming we, or our potential future collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and our potential future collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue to\nexpend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control.\nIf we, and our future potential collaborators, are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we, and our potential future collaborators, could have the marketing approvals for our drugs withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our, or our potential future collaborators\u2019, ability to market any future drugs could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted, in a manner that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would impact our ability to generate revenue.\nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, such as for DANYELZA, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad.\nDANYELZA and any of our product candidates for which we, or our potential future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future will be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our drugs following approval.\nDANYELZA and any of our product candidates for which we, or our potential future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future, will be subject to continual review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nThe FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our potential future collaborators, do not market any of our product candidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our drugs or their manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u25cf litigation involving patients taking our drug;\n\u25cf restrictions on such drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug;\n\u25cf restrictions on drug distribution or use;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the drugs from the market;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf recall of drugs;\n\u25cf fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u25cf damage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u25cf restrictions on coverage by third-party payors;\n\u25cf unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of drugs;\n\u25cf drug seizure; or\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nCurrent and future legislation, and a change in existing government regulations and policies, may increase the difficulty and cost for us and our potential future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of our potential future collaborators, to profitably sell any drugs for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or our potential future collaborators, may receive for any approved drugs.\nIn the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers.\nNew laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. We cannot predict whether these challenges will continue or other proposals will be made or adopted, or what impact these efforts may have on us. Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level\nof reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nSome states are also considering legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices and coverage and reimbursement levels of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the U.S. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases.\nWe expect healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for DANYELZA and any other approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures. The cost of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States, and members of Congress and the Administration have stated that they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. The pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is also subject to governmental control outside the United States. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to that of other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable could be impaired.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of DANYELZA or our other approved products, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any future collaborators to more stringent drug labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nGovernment price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for DANYELZA and omburtamab, if approved, or any of our other product candidates that may be approved in the future, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe expect that coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products may be increasingly restricted both in the U.S. and internationally. The escalating cost of health care has led to increased pressure on the health care industry to reduce costs. In particular, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies has come under increased scrutiny and continues to be subject to intense political and public debate in the U.S. and abroad. Government and private third-party payors have proposed health care reforms and cost reductions. A number of federal and state proposals to control the cost of health care, including the cost of drug treatments, have been made in the U.S. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In some international markets, the government controls the pricing, which can affect the profitability of drugs.\nCurrent government regulations and possible future legislation regarding health care may affect coverage and reimbursement for medical treatment by third-party payors, which may render DANYELZA or our other product candidates, if approved, not commercially viable or may adversely affect our anticipated future revenues and gross margins.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments. However, future price controls or other changes in pricing regulation or negative publicity related to the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for any our future products, which would adversely affect our anticipated revenue and results of operations.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties, including criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors are subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors and patients may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute DANYELZA and other our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u25cf Anti-Kickback Statute-the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf False Claims Act-the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties;\n\u25cf HIPAA-the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouse as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf HIPAA Privacy Provisions-as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, HIPAA also imposes obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouse as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and HIPAA, as amended, requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf Transparency Requirements-the federal legislation commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, therapeutic biologics and medical supplies reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Programs to report annually to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to certain payments and other transfers of value, including consulting fees, travel reimbursements, research grants, and other payments or gifts with values over $10 made to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf FDCA-the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices; and\n\u25cf Analogous State and Foreign Laws-analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIn Europe, the collection and processing of personal data-including health data-is governed by the European Union-wide General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. GDPR applies to us through the activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary Y-mAbs Therapeutics A/S, and also to most businesses, regardless of location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU, which includes our clinical trial activities in European Union Member States. The GDPR imposes operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, special protections for \u201csensitive information\u201d which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer \u201cadequate\u201d privacy protections. The GDPR provides that European Union Member States may make their own further laws and regulations related to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could result in differences between Member States, limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. We are also subject to evolving and strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with European Union data protection laws may result in fines and other administrative penalties, which may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that interpretation of healthcare laws and regulations will vary across jurisdictions, and that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If\nour operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. We have established internal policies and procedure to mitigate our compliance risks. However, no assurance can be given that such policies and procedures will be adequate to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Moreover, although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, it may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources, and they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for DANYELZA and our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell DANYELZA and our product candidates profitably.\nSuccessful sales of DANYELZA and our product candidates, if approved, depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. In addition, because DANYELZA and our product candidates represent relatively new approaches to the treatment of cancer, we cannot accurately estimate the potential revenue from DANYELZA or our product candidates.\nPatients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u25cf a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u25cf safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u25cf appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u25cf cost-effective; and\n\u25cf neither experimental nor investigational.\nIn the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. To date, although a number of third party providers have established coverage policies and provided reimbursement for DANYELZA, no third party provider has established coverage policies or provided reimbursement for any of our other product candidates. Even if we obtain coverage for DANYELZA or any other product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of our products, if approved. Patients are unlikely to use our product unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Because our products and product candidates have a higher cost of goods\nthan conventional therapies, and may require long-term follow up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be greater.\nTo date DANYELZA has been approved for sale in the United States only, but we intend to seek approval to market our products in both the United States as well as in selected foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions for our product candidates, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, particularly those in the EU, the pricing of biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval of a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures.\nWe may incur significant liability if enforcement authorities allege or determine that we are engaging in commercial activities or promoting DANYELZA or another product candidate in a way that violates applicable regulations.\nPhysicians have the discretion to prescribe drug products for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. Off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatments, the FDA and other regulatory agencies regulate a manufacturer\u2019s communications regarding off-label use and prohibit off-label promotion, as well as the dissemination of false or misleading labeling or promotional materials. Manufacturers may not promote drugs for off-label uses. Accordingly, we may not promote DANYELZA in the United States for use in any indications other than relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in bone and/or bone marrow. The FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, which may include civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions.\nNotwithstanding regulations related to product promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. We intend to engage in medical education activities and communicate with healthcare providers in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory guidance.\nOur radioimmunotherapy product candidates have very limited shelf lives that make them susceptible to damage and loss, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur radioimmunotherapy product candidates have very limited shelf life once radiolabelled with radioactive elements. These product candidates require reliable transportation or radiolabelling production facilities located in close proximity to their final customers to avoid spoilage, damage and/or loss. The failure of third parties with whom we contract to deliver these product candidates within the scope of their limited shelf lives could result in the loss of a given shipment and the sales associated with it. Any delay in shipment results in a loss of the radioactive dose as a result of radioactive decay, with the risk that the entire useful dose may be lost. Moreover, since each order is made individually and delivered with dedicated transportation in compliance with local regulations applicable to the delivery of radioactive materials, we do not have readily available replacements to substitute for a lost delivery if circumstances beyond our control, such as delays or problems caused by weather changes or a failure in the transportation system operated by third parties that we hire, prevent the timely delivery of a batch, or if our facilities fail to distribute the ordered batch in a timely fashion in accordance with specifications. Such losses or failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous, radioactive and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological\nmaterials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or commercialization efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nLaws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products or product candidates outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nWe currently have operations in the United States and Denmark and we maintain relationships with CMOs in other parts of Europe as well as in the United States for the manufacture of our product candidates. If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations in each new jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The creation and implementation of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required. No assurance can be given that our compliance policies and procedures are or will be sufficient or that our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible, nor can we assure you that our business partners have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations to us or even result in our being held liable for such conduct.\nThe FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the DOJ. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. Similar laws in other countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, may apply to our operations.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from\ndeveloping, manufacturing, or selling certain drugs and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including suspension or debarment from government contracting. Violation of the FCPA or other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws or regulations can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Indictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the U.S. government until the pending claims are resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing international business practices would have a negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure government contracts. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. It is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights and technology, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights including patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our products, product candidates and related proprietary technologies, their respective components, formulations, methods used to manufacture them and methods of treatment, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products, product candidates and related proprietary technologies is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nThe patenting process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, we may not be able to pursue or obtain patent protection in all relevant markets. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents that protect our product candidates or related technologies, in whole or in part. In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technology or from developing competing product candidates or products and related technologies.\nWe currently depend on proprietary technology licensed from MSK and MIT and may depend on other third-party licensors in the future. If we lose our existing licenses or are unable to acquire or license additional proprietary rights from MSK, MIT or other third parties, we may not be able to continue developing our products.\nWe currently in-license certain intellectual property from MSK and MIT. In the future we may in-license intellectual property from other licensors. We rely on certain of these licensors to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain patents and otherwise protect the intellectual property we license from them. We have limited control over these activities or any other intellectual property that may be related to our in-licensed intellectual property. For example, we cannot be certain that such activities by these licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid, enforceable or sufficient patents and other intellectual property rights. We have limited control over the manner in which our licensors may initiate an infringement proceeding against a third-party infringer of the intellectual property rights, or defend certain of the intellectual property that is licensed to us. It is possible that the licensors\u2019 infringement proceedings or defense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted them ourselves.\nThe growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire or in-license additional proprietary rights. For example, our programs may involve additional product candidates that may require the use of additional proprietary rights held by third parties. Our products or product candidates may also require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently. These formulations may be covered by intellectual property rights held by others. We may develop products containing our compounds and pre-existing pharmaceutical compounds. These pharmaceutical\ncompounds may be covered by intellectual property rights held by others. We may be required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to provide a companion diagnostic test or tests with our products or product candidates. Such diagnostic test or tests may be covered by intellectual property rights held by others. We may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights obtained in collaboration with any other party, or intellectual property rights obtained relating to improvements of in-licensed products or processes.\nWe may be unable to acquire or in-license any relevant third-party intellectual property rights that we identify as necessary or important to our business operations. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all, which would harm our business. We may need to cease use of the compositions or methods covered by such third-party intellectual property rights, and may need to seek to develop alternative approaches that do not infringe on such intellectual property rights which may entail additional costs and development delays, even if we were able to develop such alternatives, which may not be feasible. Even if we are able to obtain a license under such intellectual property rights, any such license may be non-exclusive, which may allow our competitors to access the same technologies licensed to us. Additionally, we sometimes collaborate with academic and other institutions, such as MSK, to accelerate our pre-clinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. In certain cases, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to others, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or to maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of such program and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nThe licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive practice, and companies that may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates, products and related proprietary technologies. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their larger size and cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such negotiations and ultimately acquire the rights to the intellectual property surrounding the additional product candidates that we may seek to acquire.\nWe are a party to license agreements with MSK, MIT and others, pursuant to which we in-license key patent and patent applications for our product candidates, products and related proprietary technologies. These existing licenses impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations or otherwise materially breach a license agreement, our licensors may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market the products covered by such licensed intellectual property. In addition, any claims asserted against us by our licensors may be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of key personnel from business operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainty as to the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and value of patents, and the potential for future changes in patent and other intellectual property protections, may result in inadequate protection of our as well as in-licensed intellectual property or may result in alleged or actual infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which many legal principles remain unresolved. In recent years patent rights have been the subject of significant litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights and in-licensed patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications and in-licensed patent applications may not result in patents being issued in the United States or in other jurisdictions which protect our products or product candidates or related technologies or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our and in-licensed patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after\nfiling, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, might require that the term of a patent issuing from a pending patent application be disclaimed and limited to the term of another patent that is commonly owned or names a common inventor. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our as well as in-licensed patent rights are highly uncertain.\nRecent or future patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our and in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of the issued patents. In March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or America Invents Act, the United States moved from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The America Invents Act includes a number of other significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and establish a new post-grant review system. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO only recently developed new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act and many of the substantive changes to patent law, including the \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d provisions, only became effective in March 2013. In addition, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. During examination of our own as well as our in-licensed patent applications third parties may present observations or submit patents, published patent applications or other prior art which may affect the patentability of the claimed inventions. The costs for obtaining patent protection may be increased significantly by the need for appeal proceedings or oral proceedings, which may also result in a patent not being issued. We may become involved in opposition, interference, derivation, post grant review, inter partes review, ex-parte re-examination or other proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others, and the outcome of any proceedings are highly uncertain. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our and in-licensed patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our products, product candidates and related technologies and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nEven if our owned or in-licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and in-licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the patent claims of our owned or in-licensed patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our products, product candidates and technology. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours or otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u25cf others may be able to make or use compounds that are similar to the pharmaceutical compounds used in our products or product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u25cf the APIs in our current products or product candidates may eventually become commercially available in generic drug products, and no patent protection may be available with regard to formulation, method of manufacture or method of use;\n\u25cf we may not be able to prevent parallel importation of products into the U.S., EU member states and/or other jurisdictions, which may reduce our profit margin;\n\u25cf we or our licensors, as the case may be, may fail to meet our obligations to the U.S. government in regards to any in-licensed patents and patent applications funded by U.S. government grants, leading to the loss of patent rights;\n\u25cf we or our licensors, as the case may be, might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our products or product candidates and proprietary technologies;\n\u25cf it is possible that our owned or in-licensed pending patent applications will not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf it is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our or our licensors\u2019 patents, as the case may be, or parts of our or their patents;\n\u25cf we may not be able to obtain patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates covering our products;\n\u25cf it is possible that others may circumvent our owned or in-licensed patents;\n\u25cf it is possible that there are unpublished applications or patent applications maintained in secrecy that may later issue with claims covering our product candidates, products or technologies similar to ours;\n\u25cf the laws of foreign countries may not protect our or our licensors\u2019, as the case may be, proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States;\n\u25cf the claims of our owned or in-licensed issued patents or patent applications, if and when issued, may not cover our product candidates or products;\n\u25cf our owned or in-licensed issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may be narrowed in scope, or be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties;\n\u25cf the inventors of our owned or in-licensed patents or patent applications may become involved with competitors, develop products or processes which design around our patents, or become hostile to us or the patents or patent applications on which they are named as inventors;\n\u25cf we have engaged in scientific relationships in the past, such as with MSK, and expect to continue to do so with MSK and/or other third parties in the future. Such third parties may develop adjacent or competing products to ours that are outside the scope of our licensed patents and/or the respective research collaboration/agreement with such third party;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional proprietary technologies for which we can obtain patent protection;\n\u25cf it is possible that products, product candidates or diagnostic tests we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other proprietary rights; or\n\u25cf the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, during the course of business we have decided not to pursue certain products or processes and we may do so again in the future. If it is later determined that our activities, product or product candidates infringed the intellectual property of any third party, we may be liable for damages, enhanced damages or subjected to an injunction, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors, collaborators and suppliers. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors or use such information to compete with us. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If our confidential or proprietary information is divulged to or acquired by third parties, including our competitors, our competitive position in the marketplace will be harmed and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf any of our owned or in-licensed patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology products and product candidates. Likewise, our current owned patents and patents in-licensed from MSK relating to our proprietary technologies and our product candidates comprise patents that are expected to expire on various dates from 2021 through 2041, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments, extensions or supplementary protection. Upon the expiration of our current patents, we may lose the right to exclude others from practicing the relevant inventions. The expiration of these patents could also have a similar material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We own or in-license pending patent applications from MSK and others covering our proprietary technologies or our product candidates that if issued as patents are expected to expire from 2021 through 2041, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments, extensions or supplementary protections. However, no assurance can be given that the USPTO or relevant foreign patent offices will grant any of these patent applications. Even if granted, we may fail to obtain patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates covering our products.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents, and we may be unable to protect our rights to our product candidates, products and technologies.\nIf we or our licensors choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions claimed in our owned or in-licensed patents, that third party may ask the court to rule that the patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we or they, as the case may be, were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we or they, as the case may be, do not have the right to stop others from using the inventions.\nThere is also a risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the third party on the ground that such third party\u2019s activities do not infringe our owned or in-licensed patents. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has changed some legal principles that affect patent applications, granted patents and assessment of the eligibility or validity of these patents. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised eligibility and validity standards. Some of our owned or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in proceedings before the USPTO, or during litigation, under the revised criteria which could also make it more difficult to obtain patents. Similar considerations pertain to patents granted outside of the United States, for which the validity, enforceability and/or scope of protection may be influenced by changing national and/or international legal principles.\nWe, or our licensors, may not be able to detect infringement against our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, which may be especially difficult for manufacturing processes or formulation patents. Even if we or our licensors detect infringement by a third party of our owned or in-licensed patents, we or our licensors, as the case may be, may choose not to pursue litigation against or settlement with the third party. If we, or our licensors, later sue such\nthird party for patent infringement, the third party may have certain legal defenses available to it, which otherwise would not be available except for the delay between when the infringement was first detected and when the suit was brought. Such legal defenses may make it impossible for us or our licensors to enforce our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, against such third party. If another party questions the patentability of any of our claims in our owned or in-licensed U.S. patents, the third party can request that the USPTO review the patent claims such as in an inter partes review, ex parte re-exam or post-grant review proceedings. These proceedings are expensive and may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. In addition to potential USPTO review proceedings, we may become a party to patent opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, or EPO, or similar proceedings in other foreign patent offices, where either our owned or in-licensed foreign patents are challenged. The costs of these opposition or similar proceedings could be substantial, and such oppositions may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. An unfavorable result at the USPTO, EPO or other patent office may result in the loss of our right to exclude others from practicing one or more of our inventions in the relevant country or jurisdiction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights other than patents, and we may be unable to protect our rights to our product candidates, products and technologies.\nWe may rely on trade secrets and confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and know-how, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Where we enter into agreements imposing confidentiality or nondisclosure obligations upon employees or third parties to protect our proprietary technology and know-how, these confidentiality obligations may be breached or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary technology and know-how. Furthermore, despite the existence of such confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, or other contractual restrictions, we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential proprietary information or trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees. In addition, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of our trade secrets or know-how.\nEnforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from using any of our trade secrets, we may incur substantial costs. These lawsuits may consume our time and other resources even if we are successful.\nThird parties may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. The occurrence of such events could limit or preclude our ability to produce or sell our products in a competitive manner or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are sued for infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products or product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields relating to our product candidates or products. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that others may assert that our products or product candidates infringe others\u2019 patent rights. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of drugs, products or their methods of use or manufacture. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates or products, technologies or methods.\nIn addition, because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology related to our products or product candidates,\ntechnology covered by our owned and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications, or that we or, if applicable, a licensor were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our products or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may affect technology covered by our owned and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned by or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. If we or one of our licensors is a party to an interference proceeding involving a U.S. patent application on inventions owned by or in-licensed to us, we may incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s time and expend other resources, even if we are successful.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. We may be subject to, or threatened with litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates or products and/or proprietary technologies infringe, misappropriate or violate their intellectual property rights.\nIf a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf infringement and other intellectual property claims, which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate or technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u25cf a court prohibiting us from developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling our product candidates or products, or from using our proprietary technologies, unless the third party licenses its product rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u25cf if a license is available from a third party, it may not be offered on reasonable terms and may require that we pay substantial royalties, upfront fees and other amounts, and/or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products; and\n\u25cf redesigning our products or product candidates or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may choose to challenge the patentability of claims in a third party\u2019s U.S. patent by requesting that the USPTO review the patent claims in an ex-parte re-exam, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings. These proceedings are expensive and may consume our time or other resources. We may choose to challenge a third party\u2019s patent in patent opposition proceedings in the EPO, or other foreign patent office. The costs of these opposition proceedings could be substantial, and such proceedings may consume our time or other resources. If we fail to obtain a favorable result at the USPTO, EPO or other patent office then we may be exposed to litigation by a third party alleging that the patent may be infringed by our product candidates or products or proprietary technologies.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights with patents throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our products or product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technology in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products or product candidates in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products against third parties in violation of our proprietary rights generally. The initiation of proceedings by third parties to challenge the scope or validity of our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent prosecution process and following the issuance of a patent. Our failure to comply with such requirements could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case if our patent were in force, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to secure trademark registrations could adversely affect our business.\nIf we do not successfully register our trademarks, we may encounter difficulty in enforcing, or be unable to enforce, our trademark rights against third parties, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace. When we file registration applications for trademarks relating to our products or product candidates, those applications may be rejected, and registered trademarks may not be obtained, maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we may receive rejections. We are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, but we may not be able to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties may oppose pending trademark registration applications or seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademark registrations may not survive such proceedings.\nIn addition, any proprietary name we use, such as DANYELZA, or propose to use with any of our products or product candidates in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered, or applied to register, the proposed proprietary name as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable proprietary product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names and logos, as appropriate, to market our brands and to build and maintain brand recognition. We rely on trademark protections to protect our business and our\nproducts and services. We generally seek to register and continue to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks, trade names and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as appropriate. Our registered trademarks or unregistered trademarks, trade names or service marks may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which our products are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks, trade names, service marks and domain names, which we need to build brand name recognition in our markets of interest. And while we seek to protect the trademarks we use in the United States and in other countries, we may be unsuccessful in obtaining registrations and/or otherwise protecting these trademarks. If that were to happen, we may be prevented from using our names, brands and trademarks unless we enter into appropriate royalty, license or coexistence agreements. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks, trade names, service marks and domain names, then we may not be able to compete effectively, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to employee matters and managing growth\nWe depend heavily on our executive officers and consultants. Our future success depends on our ability to retain our senior management and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. The loss of their services could materially harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent on the members of our executive management as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific teams. Our agreements with any of them do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We intend to conduct our operations in the New York City metropolitan area, in a region that is headquarters to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high, which may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all. We expect that we will need to recruit talent from outside of our region, and doing so may be costly and difficult.\nTo induce valuable employees to join and remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided, and intend to continue to provide, stock option and/or restricted stock grants that vest over time. The value to employees of these equity grants that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in the fair market value of our capital stock that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice.\nIn addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe have expanded and expect to continue to expand our development and regulatory capabilities and our sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe have expanded and continue to expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of sales and marketing, clinical operations, regulatory affairs and, drug development. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our\nmanagerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks related to our common stock\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders have ownership of a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors and our stockholders, which own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock beneficially own shares representing approximately 35.6% of our common stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to exert significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would have significant influence over the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u25cf establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u25cf allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u25cf require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u25cf limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u25cf require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and, as a result, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on September 21, 2018. Given the limited trading history of our common stock, there is a risk that an active trading market for our shares will not be sustained, which could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock and thereby affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares.\nEffective as of December 31, 2020, we became a large accelerated filer and were no longer an emerging growth company. We are not able to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies.\nAs a result of our public float (the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates) as of June 30, 2020, we became a large accelerated filer as of December 31, 2020 and therefore no longer qualified as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. Additionally, due to our public float as of June 30, 2020, we no longer qualified as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act. As a large accelerated filer, we are subject to certain disclosure and compliance requirements that apply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company. These requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u25cf compliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation;\n\u25cf the requirement that we provide full and more detailed disclosures regarding executive compensation; and\n\u25cf the requirement that we hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect that compliance with the additional requirements of being a large accelerated filer will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and cause management and other personnel to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to public company reporting requirements. In addition, if we are not able to comply with changing requirements in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUtilization of net operating loss carry forwards depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured, and the impact of the Tax Reform Bill. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. We have performed an analysis of our Section 382 ownership changes through March 31, 2021. Due to the large annual limitation, we believe that it is more likely than not that none of the net operating loss carryforwards will expire as a result of the limitation from the ownership change under Section 382.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock for the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales of common stock by stockholders may have an adverse effect on the then prevailing market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nSales of our common stock may be made by holders of our public float or by holders of restricted securities in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act. There were 43,713,534 shares of common stock outstanding as of February 22, 2022. Of these shares of our common stock, 6,900,000 shares sold in our initial public offering in 2018, 5,134,750 shares sold in our public offering in 2019 and 2,804,878 shares sold in our public offering in February 2021 are freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market. As of February 22, 2022 holders of approximately 2,550,348 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. We have also registered 6,200,000 shares of our common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans.\nAlso, in general under Rule 144, a non-affiliated person who has satisfied a six-month holding period in a company registered under the Exchange Act, as amended, may, sell their restricted common stock without volume limitation, so long as the issuer is current with all reports under the Exchange Act in order for there to be adequate common public information.\nAffiliated persons may also sell their common shares held for at least six months, but affiliated persons will be required to meet certain other requirements, including manner of sale, notice requirements and volume limitations. Non-affiliated persons who hold their common shares for at least one year will be able to sell their common stock without the need for there to be current public information in the hands of the public. Future sales of shares of our public float or by restricted common stock made in compliance with Rule 144 may have an adverse effect on the then prevailing market price, if any, of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or employees to our company or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum\nprovision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or other stockholders.\nGeneral risk factors\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders if we issue equity securities, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\nWe may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies, or businesses. Any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u25cf the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf the issuance of our equity securities;\n\u25cf assimilation of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integration;\n\u25cf the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;\n\u25cf retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u25cf risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n\u25cf our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nIn addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities, which could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business.\nWe expect our operating results to fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past, and we believe they will continue to do so in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate due to the level of success of our commercial efforts, as well as the variable nature of our operating expenses as a result of the timing and magnitude of expenditures. In one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nDrug development is a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. If clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs, experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development of our product candidates or be unable to obtain marketing approval. We may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or may not be able to conduct our trials on the timelines we expect.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete pre-clinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of pre-clinical studies and early stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial, such as the results of our ongoing clinical trials of our lead product candidates, do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drugs.\nNo assurance can be given that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs for any of our product candidates in the future and we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. Moreover, even if these clinical studies begin, issues may arise that could suspend or terminate such clinical trials. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally, including through collaboration partners, could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States, and submitted a MAA for omburtamab to EMA in April 2021 for the treatment of pediatric patients with CNS/leptomeningeal metastasis from neuroblastoma. We also have existing commercialization collaborations in certain territories outside the United States such as with SciClone, Takeda Israel, Swixx Biopharma AG and Adium. Accordingly, we and our existing and potential collaborators in jurisdictions outside the US, are subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u25cf differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls, and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf compliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf foreign taxes, including local transfer pricing regulations and withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u25cf potential liability under the FCPA, or OFAC, Anti-Money Laundering Program as required by the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations, or comparable foreign laws;\n\u25cf challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u25cf production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u25cf business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our current and planned international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our third-party research institution collaborators, CROs, CMOs, other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future CROs, CMOs, other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown or other significant disruption and unauthorized access. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on our third-party research institution collaborators for research and development of our product candidates and other third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our third party research institution collaborators, CROs, CMOs, suppliers, other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, droughts, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, climate change events, medical epidemics, terrorist activities, cyber security attacks and other natural or man made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self insured, and other severe hazards or global health crises, such as an outbreak of Ebola or the ongoing global COVID 19 pandemic, or other actual or threatened epidemic, pandemic, outbreak and spread of a communicable disease or virus, in the countries where we operate or plan to sell our products, if approved, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, we rely on our third party research institution collaborators for conducting research and development of our product candidates, and they may be affected by government shutdowns or withdrawn funding. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third party manufacturers to produce and process our DANYELZA and our product candidates. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man made or natural disaster or other business interruption. Damage or extended periods of interruption to our third party collaborators\u2019, including MSK\u2019s, corporate, development or research facilities due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, communications failure, unauthorized entry or other events could cause us to cease or delay development of some or all of our product candidates. Although we intend to maintain property damage and business interruption insurance coverage on these facilities, our insurance might not cover all losses under such circumstances and our business may be seriously harmed by such delays and interruption. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other global health crisis, such as COVID-19, on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the duration and severity of such epidemic, pandemic or other global health crisis, actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread and the pace of global economic recovery following containment of the spread.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the sale of DANYELZA and clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize more products. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during use, clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for our products;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to continue clinical trials;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any product candidate;\n\u25cf loss of any potential future revenue; and\n\u25cf a decline in our share price.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of DANYELZA or any product candidates we develop, alone or with collaborators. The amount of clinical trial and product liability insurance coverage that we may obtain, may not be adequate, we may be unable to maintain such insurance, or we may not be able to obtain additional or replacement insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. Our insurance policies may also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise.\nBrexit may affect our operations.\nOn January 31, 2020 the United Kingdom withdrew from and ceased to be part of the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Trade between European Union member states and the United Kingdom is now governed by the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which took effect after the Brexit transition period expired\non December 31, 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement contains a number of general provisions on regulation and regulatory practice that are intended to facilitate exchange of goods and services between the European Union and the United Kingdom. However, since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval and/or sale of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. The unavoidable uncertainties and events related to Brexit could cause volatility in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and European, United Kingdom or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or European Union for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud, misconduct or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and negligent conduct that fails to: comply with the regulations of the FDA, the EMA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies; provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, the EMA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies; comply with manufacturing standards we have established; comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; or report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. As we have obtained FDA approval of DANYELZA and have begun commercializing DANYELZA in the United States, our exposure under such laws has increased significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws have increased significantly and are likely to continue to increase. These laws impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research patients, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe may be subject to claims that our licensors, employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or their clients.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim\nproceedings or developments, and, if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. This type of litigation or proceeding could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our drug, clinical development programs, and the diseases our drug and drug candidates are being developed to treat, and we are utilizing what we believe is appropriate social media in connection with our commercialization efforts for DANYELZA and we intend to do the same for our future products, if approved. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business, resulting in potential regulatory actions against us. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical study or to report an alleged adverse event, or AE. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable AE reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend our business or the public\u2019s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our investigational products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions, or incur other harm to our business.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock. Also, the volatility of our stock price may adversely affect our ability to attract equity funding in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Since our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on September 22, 2018, our stock has traded at prices as low as $6.50 per share and as high as $55.22 per share through February 22, 2022. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price your paid for it. Further, as a result of this volatility it may be difficult for us to attract new equity investments in the Company, including to carry out public offerings of our common stock, on terms we consider reasonable or at all.\nThe market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to successfully launch and commercialize DANYELZA and any other product candidates, if approved;\n\u25cf the timing and results of clinical trials of any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf regulatory actions with respect to our products or product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products and product candidates;\n\u25cf the success of existing or new competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf establishment or termination of collaborations for our products and product candidates or development programs;\n\u25cf failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs;\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the level of revenues and expenses related to any of our products, product candidates or development programs;\n\u25cf the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u25cf our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products, actual or anticipated changes in forecasts of financial performance, or changes in development timelines;\n\u25cf announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or other stockholders;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, that cover our stock;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf market conditions and investor sentiment in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and our resources, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe were no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of December 31, 2020 as the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of June 30, 2020. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur inability to operate controls effectively could cause material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. An adverse report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in future years, by our independent registered public accounting firm could have a material adverse impact on our company and financial statements and we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management and our independent registered public accounting firm to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation. In connection with our and our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s evaluations of our internal control over financial reporting, we may need to upgrade systems, including information technology, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures, and hire additional accounting and finance staff.\nAny failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us or our independent registered public accounting firm conducted in connection with Section 404 may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Internal control deficiencies could also result in a restatement of our financial results in the future. We could become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation, as well as investigations by the SEC, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, trading suspensions, payment of damages or other remedies. Further, any delay in compliance with the auditor attestation provisions of Section 404 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including ineligibility for short-form resale registration, action by the SEC and the suspension or delisting of our common stock, which could reduce the trading price of our common stock and could harm our business.\nWe will continue to incur costs associated with satisfying our obligations as public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, and as a large accelerated filer we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nWe may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.\nIncreasing stakeholder environmental, social and governance, or ESG, expectations, physical and transition risks associated with climate change, and emerging ESG regulation and policy requirements may pose risk to our market outlook, and reputation, financial outlook, cost of capital, supply chain and production continuity, which may impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations could lead to additional operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our third party providers or otherwise could negatively impact our business.\nChanges in market dynamics, stakeholder expectations, local, national and international climate change policies, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the United States and abroad, all have the potential to disrupt our business and operations. Such events could result in a significant increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial performance. Global climate change is resulting in, and may continue to result, in certain natural disasters and adverse weather events, such as droughts, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could cause business disruptions and impact employees\u2019 abilities to commute or to work from home effectively. Government failure to address climate change in line with the Paris Agreement could result in greater exposure to economic and other risks from climate change and impact our ability to achieve our goals.", "PERMNO": 18133, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "YMAB"}
