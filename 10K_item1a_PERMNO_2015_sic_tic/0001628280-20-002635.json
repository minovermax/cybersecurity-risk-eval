RISK FACTORS\nMany statements contained in this report are forward-looking in nature. See \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d These statements are based on current plans, intentions or expectations, and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following:\nBUSINESS RISKS\nOur results may be impacted by economic trends.\nOur net revenues increased in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of organic growth and strategic acquisitions made during 2018 and 2019.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by economic fluctuations or future economic downturns. Also, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions. The risks associated with our business could be more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising expenditures. A decrease in advertising expenditures could adversely impact our business, financial condition and result of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse impact on our ability to access capital, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets\nmay be severely restricted at a time when we would like or need to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our capacity to react to changing economic and business conditions.\nOur radio stations may be adversely affected by changes in programming and competition for advertising revenues.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business. Our radio stations compete for audiences with advertising revenues as our principal source of income. We compete directly with other radio stations, as well as with other media, such as broadcast, cable and satellite television, satellite radio and pure-play digital audio, newspapers and magazines, national and local digital services, outdoor advertising and direct mail. We also compete for advertising dollars with other large companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. Audience ratings and market shares are subject to change, and any decrease in our listenership ratings or market share in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenues of our stations located in that market. Audience ratings and market shares could be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the format or content of programming (some of which may be outside of our control), personnel changes, demographic shifts and general broadcast listening trends. Adverse changes in any of these areas or trends could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we already compete in some of our markets with stations with similarly programmed formats, if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations or if an existing competitor were to garner additional market share, our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and/or advertising revenues and could incur increased promotional and other expenses. Competing companies may be larger and/or have more financial resources than we do. There can be no assurance that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings, market shares and advertising revenues.\nCybersecurity threats could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe use of our computers and digital technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations gives rise to cybersecurity risks, including malware, spam, advanced persistent threats, email Denial of Service, or DoS, and Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, data leaks, and other security threats. A cybersecurity attack could compromise confidential information or disrupt our operations. There can be no assurance that we, or the information security systems we implement, will protect against all of these rapidly changing risks. A cybersecurity incident could increase our operating costs, disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, or subject us to liability under contracts with our commercial partners, or laws and regulations that protect personal data. We maintain insurance coverage against certain of such risks, but cannot guarantee that such coverage will be applicable or sufficient with respect to any given incident or on-going incidents that go undetected. In 2019, we experienced malware attacks which temporarily disrupted certain business operations, and, although these events did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed, and further enhanced, our systems and processes that are designed to protect personal information and prevent data loss and other security breaches such as those we have experienced in the past, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nCybersecurity breaches may increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur information security systems and processes, which are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of networks, systems, applications and digital information, cannot provide absolute security. Cybersecurity breaches could result in an increase in costs related to securing our systems against cybersecurity threats, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory investigation, and other remediation costs or capital expense associated with detecting, preventing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents, including augmenting backup and recovery capabilities.\nThe loss of, or difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining, key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key personnel. We believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition for experienced professional personnel is intense, and we must work to retain and attract these professionals. For example, our radio stations compete for creative and on-air talent with other radio stations and other media, such as broadcast, cable and satellite television, digital media and satellite radio. Our on-air talent are subject to change, due to competition and other reasons. Changes in on-air talent could materially and negatively affect our ratings and our ability to attract local and national advertisers, which could in turn adversely affect our revenues.\nIncreases in or new royalties, including through legislation, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must pay royalties to the copyright owners of musical compositions (e.g., song composers, publishers, et al.) for the public performance of such musical compositions on our radio stations and internet streams. We satisfy this requirement by obtaining blanket public performance licenses from performing rights organizations (\"PROs\"). We pay fees to the PROs for these licenses, and the PROs in turn compensate the copyright owners. We currently maintain, and pay all fees associated with, public performance licenses from the following PROs: American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (\"ASCAP\"), Broadcast Music, Inc. (\"BMI\"), SESAC, Inc. (\"SESAC\"), and Global Music Rights (\"GMR\"). The royalty rates we pay to copyright owners for the public performance of musical compositions on our radio stations and internet streams could increase as a result of private negotiations and the emergence of new PROs, which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must also pay royalties to the copyright owners of sound recordings (e.g., record labels, recording artists, et al.) for the digital audio transmission of such sound recordings on the Internet. We pay such royalties under federal statutory licenses and pay applicable license fees to SoundExchange, the non-profit organization designated by the United States Copyright Royalty Board (\"CRB\") to collect such license fees. The royalty rates applicable to sound recordings under federal statutory licenses are subject to adjustment by the CRB. The royalty rates we pay to copyright owners for the digital audio transmission of sound recordings on the Internet could increase as a result of private negotiations, regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions, which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not pay royalties for the public performance of sound recordings by means of terrestrial broadcasts on our radio stations. However, from time-to-time, Congress considers legislation that would require radio broadcasters to pay royalties to applicable copyright owners for the public performance of sound recordings by means of terrestrial broadcasts. Such proposed legislation has been the subject of considerable debate and activity by the radio broadcast industry and other parties that could be affected. We cannot predict whether or not any such proposed legislation will become law. New royalty rates for the public performance of sound recordings by means of terrestrial broadcasts on our radio stations could increase our expenses, which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFederal copyright law has historically provided copyright protection for sound recordings made and fixed to a tangible medium on or after February 15, 1972. The Music Modernization Act (\"MMA\") signed into law on October 11, 2018 (the \"MMA Enactment Date\") extends federal copyright protection, and preempts all State laws applicable, to sound recordings created prior to February 15, 1972 (the \"Pre-1972 Recordings\") as of the MMA Enactment Date. A number of recording artists and independent record labels claim the laws of certain States provide copyright protections for their Pre-1972 Recordings, and have brought claims in those States against several radio broadcasters (including CBS Radio) for allegedly infringing on the exclusive public performance right of such recording artists and record labels in their Pre-1972 Recordings.\nIn August 2015, CBS Radio was named as a defendant in two separate putative class action lawsuits in a federal court in each of California and New York for common law copyright infringement as well as related state law claims. In May 2016, the California court dismissed the California case against CBS Radio. In June 2016, the plaintiff record labels appealed this judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In March 2017, the New York federal court dismissed the New York suit with prejudice. In the California case, the plaintiffs sought to certify a class action related to other Pre-1972 Recordings. The California District Court: (a) struck the class certification claims; and (b) granted summary judgment in CBS Radio\u2019s favor on the basis that CBS Radio had publicly performed post-1972 digitally remastered recordings, those remastered recordings were derivative works sufficiently original to be copyrightable, and thus those works were governed exclusively by federal law, rather than California state law which governs the public performance of the original recordings. In August 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the California District Court opinion. We filed a petition for rehearing en banc on September 18, 2018. That petition was denied. However, the original decision was amended in part. Following remand, the California District Court entered a stay, pending the outcome of a separate case, Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Pandora Media, Inc., in which the California Supreme Court will decide whether California law recognizes a public performance right for Pre-1972 Recordings. An adverse decision in the California case against us could impede our ability to broadcast or stream the Pre-1972 Recordings and/or increase our royalty payments, as well as expose us to liability for past broadcasts.\nThe failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is important to the success of our business. We endeavor to protect our intellectual property under trade secret, trademark, copyright and patent law, and through a combination\nof employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, other contractual restrictions, and other methods. We have registered trademarks in state and federal trademark offices in the United States and enforce our rights through, among other things, filing oppositions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Offices. There is a risk that unauthorized digital distribution of our content could occur, and competitors may adopt names similar to ours or use confusingly similar terms as keywords in internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and leading to confusion among our audience or advertisers. Moreover, maintaining and policing our intellectual property rights may require us to spend significant resources as litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, courts or other administrative bodies, is unpredictable and may not always be cost-effective. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property. The failure to protect and enforce our intellectual property could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims and litigation from third parties claiming that our operations infringe on their intellectual property. Any intellectual property litigation could be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any such actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to operate our business.\nWe cannot predict the competitive effect on the radio broadcasting industry of changes in audio content distribution, changes in technology or changes in regulations.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services with which we compete for listeners and advertising revenues. We may lack the resources to acquire new technologies or introduce new services to allow us to effectively compete with these new offerings. Competing technologies and services which compete for listeners and advertising revenues traditionally spent on audio advertising include: (i) personal audio devices such as smart phones; (ii) satellite-delivered digital radio services that offer numerous programming channels such as Sirius Satellite Radio; (iii) audio programming by internet content providers and internet radio stations such as Spotify and Pandora; (iv) low-power FM radio stations, which are non-commercial FM radio broadcast outlets that serve small, localized areas; (v) digital audio files made available on the Internet for downloading to a computer or mobile device such as podcasts that permit users to listen to programming on a time-delayed basis and to fast-forward through programming and/or advertisements; and (vi) search engine and e-commerce websites where a significant portion of their revenues are derived from advertising revenues such as Google and Yelp.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory changes may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive regulations and are dependent on federally-issued licenses to operate our radio stations. Failure to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. See Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting under Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d We are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our radio stations. Licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable. Although the vast majority of FCC radio station licenses are routinely renewed, there can be no assurance that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications. During the periods when a renewal application is pending, informal objections and petitions to deny the renewal application can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public, on a variety of grounds. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations. The FCC\u2019s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on our operations, and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business. The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. If the FCC relaxes these technical requirements, it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. Moreover, these FCC regulations may change over time, and there can be no assurance that changes would not adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently the subject of several pending investigations by the FCC. Refer to Note 22, Contingencies And Commitments, for further details regarding one such investigation.\nCongress or federal agencies that regulate us could impose new regulations or fees on our operations that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThere has been in the past and there could be again in the future proposed legislation that requires radio broadcasters to pay additional fees such as a spectrum fee for the use of the spectrum. In addition, there has been proposed legislation which would impose a new royalty fee that would be paid to record labels and performing artists for use of their recorded music. It is currently unknown what impact any potential required royalty payments or fees would have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on selected market clusters of radio stations for a material portion of our revenues.\nFor 2019, we generated over 50% of our as reported net revenues in 9 of our 47 markets, which were Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Accordingly, we have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions in any of these markets, such as changes in the economy, shifts in population or demographics, or changes in audience tastes, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImpairments to our broadcasting licenses and goodwill have reduced our earnings.\nWe have incurred impairment charges that resulted in non-cash write-downs of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill. A significant amount of these impairment losses were recorded in 2008 during the recession, during the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of an interim impairment assessment, and during the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with our annual impairment assessment (described below). As of December 31, 2019, our broadcasting licenses and goodwill comprised approximately 70% of our total assets.\nThe annual impairment assessment conducted during the fourth quarter of 2019 indicated: (i) that the fair value of our broadcasting licenses exceeded their respective carrying amounts; and (ii) the fair value of our goodwill was less than its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $537.4 million impairment charge ($519.6 million, net of tax) on our goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe valuation of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill is subjective and based on our estimates and assumptions rather than precise calculations. The fair value measurements for both our broadcasting licenses and goodwill use significant unobservable inputs and reflect our own assumptions, including market share and profit margin for an average station, growth within a radio market, estimates of costs and losses during early years, potential competition within a radio market and the appropriate discount rate used in determining fair value. While our goodwill impairment assessment utilizes a discounted cash flow method by projecting our income over a specified time and capitalizing at an appropriate market rate to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price, we also consider other relevant market information such as our stock price. If events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the broadcasting licenses and goodwill below the amount reflected on the balance sheet, we may be required to recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods. Current accounting guidance does not permit a valuation increase.\nWe have significant obligations relating to our current operating leases.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had future operating lease commitments of approximately $355.0 million that are disclosed in Note 22, Contingencies And Commitments, in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements. We are required to make certain estimates at the inception of a lease in order to determine whether the lease is an operating or finance lease. In February 2016, the accounting guidance was modified to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The most notable change in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases with a term of more than one year. This guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2019. The impact of this guidance had a material impact on our financial position and the impact to our results of operations and cash flows was not material. As of January 1, 2019, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to our accumulated deficit of $4.7 million, net of taxes of $1.7 million. This adjustment was attributable to the recognition of deferred gains from a sale and leaseback transaction under the previous accounting guidance for leases. The most significant impact of the adoption of the new leasing guidance was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on the balance sheet of $288.7 million and $306.2 million, respectively, on January 1, 2019. The difference between the ROU assets and lease liabilities recorded upon implementation was primarily attributable to deferred rent balances and unfavorable lease liabilities which were combined and presented net within the ROU assets.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems, and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nThe proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. If these information technology systems fail or are interrupted, our operations and operating results may be adversely affected. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the future growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party providers, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control. These include catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, computer system or network failures and natural disasters. Any material disruption, malfunction or similar challenges with our business processes or information systems, or disruptions or challenges relating to the transition to new processes, systems or providers, could adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe FCC has engaged in vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Over the last decade, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency and has threatened on more than one occasion to initiate license revocation proceedings against a broadcast licensee who commits a \u201cserious\u201d indecency violation. Congress has dramatically increased the penalties for broadcasting obscene, indecent or profane programming, and these penalties may potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation, renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast such material. In addition, the FCC\u2019s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme, against the broadcast industry generally, may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations. We may in the future become subject to inquiries or proceedings related to our stations\u2019 broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane material. To the extent that these inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines, a settlement with the FCC, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions.\nThe integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks, including:\n\u2022the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022the potential coordination of a greater number of diverse businesses and/or businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations;\n\u2022retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u2022the potential diversion of management\u2019s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters;\n\u2022unforeseen expenses or delays in anticipated timing;\n\u2022attracting and retaining the necessary personnel;\n\u2022creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and\n\u2022integrating accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll, purchasing and regulatory compliance systems.\nWe are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable. This risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions.\nOur outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables, which risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and enable us to avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe rely on key contracts and business relationships, and if our business partners or contracting counterparties fail to perform, or terminate, any of their contractual arrangements with us for any reason or cease operations, our business could be disrupted and our revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on key contracts and business relationships, and if our business partners or contracting counterparties fail to perform, or terminate, any of their contractual arrangements with us for any reason or cease operations, our business could be disrupted and our revenues could be adversely affected. For instance, if one of our business partners or counterparties is unable (including as a result of any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding) or unwilling to continue operating in the line of business that is the subject of our contract, we may not be able to obtain similar relationships and agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. The failure to perform or termination of any of the agreements by a partner or a counterparty, the discontinuation of operations of a partner or counterparty, the loss of good relations with a partner or counterparty or our inability to obtain similar relationships or agreements, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had a senior secured credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) of $1.0 billion outstanding that is comprised of: (a) a $770.0 million term B-2 loan (the \u201cTerm B-2 Loan\u201d); and (b) a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolver\u201d), of which $117.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2019. In addition to the Credit Facility, we also have outstanding $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.250% senior notes due October 2024 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and $425.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior secured second-lien notes due May 2027 (the \"Notes\").\nThis significant amount of indebtedness could have an adverse impact on us. For example, these obligations:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to and limit the flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate, the economy and government regulations;\n\u2022may restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022may limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions including share repurchases\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowing under the Term B-2 Loan and Revolver are subject to variable rates of interest; and\n\u2022may limit or prohibit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nThe undrawn amount of the Revolver was $127.1 million as of December 31, 2019. The amount of the Revolver available to us is a function of covenant compliance at the time of borrowing. Based on our financial covenant analysis as of December 31, 2019, we would not be limited in these borrowings.\nWe may from time to time seek to amend our existing indebtedness agreements or obtain funding or additional debt financing, which may result in higher interest rates.\nThe terms of the Credit Facility, the Senior Notes and the Notes may restrict our current and future operations.\nThe Credit Facility, the Indenture governing the Senior Notes (the \u201cSenior Notes Indenture\u201d) and the Indenture governing the Notes (the \"Notes Indenture\") contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our stock;\n\u2022make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into Sale and Lease-Back Transactions (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture);\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022prepay certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022issue or sell stock; and\n\u2022change the nature of our business.\nAs a result of our substantial indebtedness, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions could hinder our ability to pursue our business strategy or inhibit our ability to adhere to our intended dividend policies.\nWe may still be able to incur substantial additional amounts of indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial additional amounts of indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with the indebtedness described above. Although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and additional liens, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to our existing indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face would intensify, and we may not be able to meet all of our respective indebtedness obligations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with the covenants in our debt agreements, which restrict our operational flexibility.\nThe Credit Facility contains provisions which, under certain circumstances: limit our ability to borrow money; make acquisitions, investments or restricted payments, including without limitation dividends and the repurchase of stock; swap or sell assets; or merge or consolidate with another company. To secure the indebtedness under our Credit Facility, we have pledged substantially all of our assets, including the stock or equity interests of our subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Facility requires us to maintain compliance with a financial covenant, including a maximum Consolidated Net First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) that cannot exceed 4.0 times as of December 31, 2019. Under certain circumstances, the Consolidated Net First Lien Leverage Ratio can increase to 4.5 times for a limited period of time.\nOur ability to comply with this financial covenant may be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will comply with these covenants. A default under the Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with our financial covenant or other terms of these financial instruments and the failure to negotiate and obtain any required relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding indebtedness and our lenders could proceed against our assets, including the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Under these circumstances, the acceleration of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA breach of the covenants under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Notes Indenture or under the Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. Such a default would allow the lenders under the Credit Facility and/or the holders of the Senior Notes and the Notes to accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an uncured event of default under the Credit Facility would also permit the lenders under the Credit Facility to terminate all other commitments to extend additional credit under the Credit Facility.\nFurthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Facility, those lenders could seek to foreclose on the collateral that secures such indebtedness. In the event that creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nBecause of our holding company structure, we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow, and our access to this cash flow is restricted.\nWe operate as a holding company. All of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries. Entercom Media Corp., our 100% owned subsidiary, is the borrower under the Credit Facility. All of our station operating subsidiaries and FCC license subsidiaries are subsidiaries of Entercom Media Corp. Most of Entercom Media Corp.\u2019s subsidiaries are full and unconditional joint and several guarantors under the Credit Facility.\nAs a holding company, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, including corporate overhead and other expenses, is cash distributed from our subsidiaries. We currently expect that the majority of the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing Entercom Media Corp.\u2019s indebtedness obligations. Even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us, there can be no assurance that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the restricted payments covenants contained in our Credit Facility, would permit such dividends or distributions.\nOur variable-rate indebtedness gives rise to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. Any increase in our debt service obligations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBorrowings under the Term B-2 Loan and the Revolver are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under the Credit Facility could increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, could correspondingly decrease.\nAs of December 31, 2019, if the borrowing rates under London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) were to increase 100 basis points above the current rates, our interest expense on: (i) the Term B-2 Loan would increase $7.6 million on an annual basis, including any increase or decrease in interest expense associated with the use of derivative hedging instruments; and (ii) the Revolver would increase by $2.5 million, assuming our entire Revolver was outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nIn the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate risk. We may, however, not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable-rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. An increase in our debt service obligations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe expected LIBOR phase-out may have unpredictable impacts on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or the broader financial markets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, intends to cease encouraging or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether LIBOR will cease to exist after that date, and there is currently no global consensus on what rate or rates will become acceptable alternatives. In the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board-led industry group, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as an alternative to LIBOR for U.S. dollar-denominated LIBOR-benchmarked obligations. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight U.S treasury repo market, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has published the daily rate since 2018. Nevertheless, because SOFR is a fully secured overnight rate and LIBOR is a forward-looking unsecured rate, SOFR is likely to be lower than LIBOR on most dates, and any spread adjustment applied by market participants to alleviate any mismatch during a transition period will be subject to methodology that remains undefined.\nAdditionally, master agreements or other contracts drafted before consensus is reached on a variety of details related to a transition may not reflect provisions necessary to address it once LIBOR is fully phased out.\nAs discussed above, borrowings under the Term B-2 Loan and Revolver are at variable rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had $770.0 million outstanding under the Term B-2 Loan and $117.0 million outstanding under the Revolver. The Revolver provides for interest based upon the Base Rate or LIBOR plus a margin. The Term B-2 Loan provides for interest based upon the Base Rate or LIBOR plus a margin. Because the Term B-2 Loan and the Revolver are, at times, LIBOR-benchmarked debt, we may be exposed to unpredictable changes in LIBOR-benchmarked provisions in such obligations. Such exposure cannot be determined at this time.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR and the transition from LIBOR to SOFR or other benchmark rates could have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or result in disruption to the broader financial markets, including causing interest rates under our current or future LIBOR-benchmarked agreements to perform differently than in the past, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nTo service our indebtedness and other cash needs, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon our future financial and operating performance, and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. There can be no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to draw under the Revolver or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, including the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nPrevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to make payments or refinance our indebtedness or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including:\n\u2022sales of assets;\n\u2022sales of equity;\n\u2022reduction or delay of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or\n\u2022negotiations with lenders to restructure the applicable indebtedness.\nThese alternative measures may not be successful and may not enable us to meet scheduled indebtedness service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial conditions at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future indebtedness agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of sufficient cash flow from operating results and other resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value, or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our indebtedness obligations, or to refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nAny decline in the ratings of our corporate credit or any indications from the rating agencies that their ratings on our corporate credit are under surveillance or review with possible negative implications could adversely impact our ability to access capital, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STOCK\nOur Chairman Emeritus and our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer own a large minority equity interest in us and have substantial influence over our Company.
