You should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating us and our operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely affect, among other things, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business will be adversely affected if there is a decline in the number of motion pictures available for screening or in the appeal of motion pictures to our patrons.\nOur business depends to a substantial degree on the availability of suitable motion pictures for screening in our theatres and the appeal of such motion pictures to patrons in our specific theatre markets. Our results of operations will vary from period to period based upon the number and popularity of the motion pictures we show in our theatres. A disruption in the production of motion pictures by, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of, the major studios and/or independent producers, a lack of motion pictures, the poor performance of motion pictures in general or the failure of motion pictures to attract the patrons in our theatre markets will likely adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we have approximately $449.6 million of indebtedness outstanding (which does not reflect amounts that may be borrowed under our revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d)), all of which is secured, and we have approximately $25.0 million available for borrowings under the Credit Facility, subject to meeting customary borrowing conditions. We also have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. As of December 31, 2014, our total operating, capital and financing lease obligations with terms over one year totaled $1,108 million. Our substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nresult in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to our 7.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d) or other debt or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the Credit Facility and the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less highly leveraged competitors who may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Senior Secured Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute a default under the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nIndex to Financial Statements The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIn addition, borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest at variable rates. If we were to borrow funds under the Credit Facility and these rates were to increase significantly, our ability to borrow additional funds may be reduced and the risks related to our substantial indebtedness would intensify. While we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements may not offer complete protection for this risk.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on the Senior Secured Notes or our other indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt before maturity, seek additional equity capital, reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures or sell material assets or operations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance or restructure our indebtedness, obtain equity capital or sell assets or operations on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the Indenture, may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. Our inability to take these actions and to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service and other obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nIf for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such outstanding indebtedness. If such a default were to occur, the note holders or lenders, as the case may be, under such indebtedness could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under it immediately due and payable, and in the case of the Credit Facility, the lenders would not be obligated to continue to advance funds under the Credit Facility. If the amounts outstanding under our debt were accelerated, it could cause an event of default under other indebtedness or allow other indebtedness to be accelerated.\nThe Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes and the Credit Agreement contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions.\nThe Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes and the credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) governing the Credit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit or restrict, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantee obligations;\n\u2022\nissue certain preferred stock or redeemable stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens or other encumbrances;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt (including the Senior Secured Notes) prior to stated maturities;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into a new or different line of business; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants. A breach of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes or in the Credit Agreement, including our inability to comply with any financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which would allow the noteholders or the lenders under the Credit Facility, as the case may be, to declare all borrowings outstanding to be due and payable under such indebtedness, which would in turn trigger an event of default under other indebtedness. At maturity or in the event of an acceleration of payment obligations, we would likely be unable to pay our outstanding indebtedness with our cash and cash equivalents then on hand. We would, therefore, be required to seek alternative sources of funding, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, terms as favorable as our current agreements or at all, or face bankruptcy. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or find alternative means of funding, we may be required to curtail our operations or take other actions that are inconsistent with our current business practices or strategy. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness, the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness.\nOur business is subject to significant competitive pressures.\nLarge multiplex theatres, which we and some of our competitors built, have tended to and are expected to continue to draw audiences away from certain older theatres, including some of our theatres. In addition, demographic changes and competitive pressures can lead to the impairment of a theatre. Over the last several years, we and many of our competitors have closed a number of theatres. Our competitors or smaller entrepreneurial developers may purchase or lease these abandoned buildings and reopen them as theatres in competition with us.\nWe face varying degrees of competition from other motion picture exhibitors with respect to licensing films, attracting customers, obtaining new theatre sites and acquiring theatre circuits. In those areas where real estate is readily available, there are few barriers preventing competing companies from opening theatres near one of our existing theatres. Competitors have built and are planning to build theatres in certain areas in which we operate. In the past, these developments have resulted and may continue to result in excess capacity in those areas, adversely affecting attendance and pricing at our theatres in those areas. Even where we are the only exhibitor in a film licensing zone (and therefore do not compete for films), we still may experience competition for patrons from theatres in neighboring zones. There have also been a number of consolidations in the film exhibition industry, and the impact of these consolidations could have an adverse effect on our business if greater size would give larger operators an advantage in negotiating licensing terms.\nOur theatres also compete with a number of other motion picture delivery systems including network, cable and satellite television, internet streaming video services, DVD\u2019s, as well as video-on-demand, pay-per-view services and downloads via the Internet. While the impact of these alternative types of motion picture delivery systems on the motion picture exhibition industry is difficult to determine precisely, there is a risk that they could adversely affect attendance at motion pictures shown in theatres.\nOur ability to attract patrons is also affected by (1) the DVD release window, which is the time between the release of a film for play in theatres and when the film is available on DVD for general public sale or rental and (2) the video-on-demand release window, which is the time between the release of a film for play in theatres and\nIndex to Financial Statements\nwhen the film is available on video-on-demand services for public viewing. Each of these release windows has been narrowing over the past several years. For example, we believe the DVD and video-on-demand release windows currently average approximately four months. It is also possible that these release windows could shorten in the near future. If these release windows continue to shorten, it might impact our ability to attract patrons to our theatres.\nFuture release windows may also shorten with the introduction of premium video-on-demand (\u201cpremium VOD\u201d). Premium VOD would allow movie studios to make movies available to customers at an increased price as soon as 30-60 days after release to the theatres. To date, few titles have been released through premium VOD. However, if movie studios increase the number of titles released with premium VOD, it might decrease our ability to draw patrons to our theatres.\nTheatres also face competition from a variety of other forms of entertainment competing for the public\u2019s leisure time and disposable income, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.\nCertain of our theatre initiatives, including in-theatre dining, enhanced food and beverage options and luxury seating may not be successful.\nAs a leading motion picture exhibitor, we continue to introduce new amenities to our theatres aimed at enhancing the experience of our patrons. These amenities, which have included in-theatre dining, expanded food and beverage options and luxury seating initiatives are subject to significant risks. There is a risk that these initiatives may not perform to our expectations or to the satisfaction of our patrons. In addition, difficulties in obtaining landlord approval as well as required operating permits and licenses, may prevent us from implementing these amenities at certain theatres. Furthermore, these initiatives require significant capital expenditures. The lack of available capital resources due to business performance or other financial commitments may prevent us from implementing these amenities at additional theatres and could limit our ability to compete with other exhibitors.\nOur revenues vary significantly depending upon the timing of the motion picture releases by distributors.\nOur business is seasonal, with a disproportionate amount of our revenues generated during the summer months and year-end holiday season. While motion picture distributors have begun to release major motion pictures more evenly throughout the year, the most marketable motion pictures are usually released during the summer months and the year-end holiday season, and we usually generate more revenue and cash flows during those periods than in other periods during the year. As a result, the timing of motion picture releases affects our results of operations, which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. If we do not adequately manage our theatre costs of operations, it could significantly affect our cash flow and potential for future growth.\nPatrons may not perceive the value of viewing films in 3-D.\nIf the quality of 3-D films released by studios declines or customers lose interest in 3-D, customers may not perceive that the value of viewing a film in 3-D outweigh the incremental cost. This may adversely affect our ability to generate additional revenue from the digital and 3-D movie experience.\nDeterioration in our relationships with any of the major film distributors could adversely affect our access to commercially successful films and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business depends to a significant degree on maintaining good relationships with the major film distributors that license films to our theatres. The film distribution business is highly concentrated, therefore any deterioration in our relationships with any of the major film distributors could adversely affect our access to commercially successful films and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, because the distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the\nIndex to Financial Statements\nsubject of numerous antitrust cases, we cannot ensure a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors. Rather, we must compete for licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis and are required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre individually.\nNegative economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results by reducing amounts consumers spend on attending movies and purchasing concessions.\nOur business depends on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities. Movie theatre attendance and concessions sales may be affected by prolonged negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases because of negative economic conditions such as job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, sharply falling home prices, reduced availability of credit and other matters, resulting in a decrease in consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to alternative forms of entertainment. This may affect the demand for movies or severely impact the motion picture production industry such that our business and operations could be adversely affected.\nWe expect to expand through acquisitions, which may divert our management\u2019s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties, increased costs and dilution to our stockholders. We also may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions.\nWe have acquired theatres and theatre circuits, and as part of our growth strategy, we expect to seek to acquire additional theatres and theatre circuits. We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates and even if we identify suitable candidates, we anticipate significant competition (including from possible buyers with greater financial resources) when trying to acquire these theatres, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such theatres at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.\nTo complete a future acquisition, we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing. This could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders or a significant increase in our leverage. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions. If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from any acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits. Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions or that other anticipated benefits will result. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to service debt incurred to finance an acquisition, our results of operations and profitability would be adversely affected.\nAny acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of assimilating the acquired operations and personnel and integrating them into our current business;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and incurring significant costs associated with pursuing and completing acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources;\n\u2022\nthe possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\nthe requirement to divest existing or acquired theatres under antitrust and competition laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that any liabilities we may incur or assume from acquired theatres may prove to be more burdensome than anticipated; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that any acquired theatres do not perform as expected.\nLabor disputes in the motion picture industry may adversely affect our business.\nAny disruption in the production or distribution of motion pictures related to disputes between film producers and film actors or other labor disputes in the motion picture industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our point-of-sale system, to operate our business and a failure of this system could harm our business.\nWe depend on our point-of-sale computer system, to operate our business and issue tickets to patrons at our theatres. A substantial system failure could restrict our ability to issue tickets timely to our patrons and could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our patrons to attend another theatre. In addition, we rely on our point-of-sale system to centralize most theatre-level administrative functions at our corporate headquarters such as coordinating payroll, tracking theatre invoices, generating operating reports to analyze film performance and theatre profitability, and generating information to quickly detect theft. Disruption in, changes to, or a breach of the point-of-sale system could result in the loss of important data, an increase of our expenses and a possible temporary cessation of our operations.\nFailure to protect our information systems and other confidential information against cyber attacks or other information security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. A failure in or breach of our information systems or other confidential information as a result of cyber attacks or other information security breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs or cause losses. As cyber and other threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.\nOur current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could significantly harm us. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.\nCompliance with the ADA could require us to incur significant capital expenditures and litigation costs in the future.\nThe ADA and certain state statutes and local ordinances, among other things, require that places of public accommodation, including both existing and newly constructed theatres, be accessible to customers with disabilities. The ADA requires that theatres be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a theatre and its facilities. The ADA may also require that certain modifications be made to existing theatres in order to make them accessible to patrons and employees who are disabled.\nIndex to Financial Statements We are aware of several lawsuits that have been filed against other motion picture exhibitors by disabled moviegoers alleging that certain stadium seating designs violated the ADA. If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance. Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to other federal, state and local laws which limit the manner in which we may conduct our business.\nOur theatre operations are subject to federal, state and local laws governing matters such as construction, renovation and operation of our theatres as well as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation requirements and licensing. While we believe that our theatres are in material compliance with these requirements, we cannot predict the extent to which any future laws or regulations that regulate employment matters will impact our operations. At December 31, 2014, approximately 35% of our hourly employees were paid at the federal minimum wage and, accordingly, the minimum wage largely determines our labor costs for those employees. Increases in the minimum wage will increase our labor costs. We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws. See Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Regulatory Environment.\u201d\nWe may be limited in our ability to utilize, or may not be able to utilize, net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability.\nAs of December 31, 2014 after applying Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) Section 382 limitations, we had $49.4 million and $91.9 million of federal and state operating loss carryforwards, respectively, with which to offset our future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the year 2020. If these loss carryforwards are unavailable for our use in future periods, this may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during the fourth quarter of 2008. This ownership change has and will continue to subject our net operating loss carryforwards to an annual limitation, which will significantly restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in periods following the ownership change. In general, the annual use limitation equals the aggregate value of our stock at the time of the ownership change multiplied by a specified tax-exempt interest rate.\nWe determined that at the date of the 2008 ownership change, we had a net unrealized built-in loss (\u201cNUBIL\u201d). The NUBIL was determined based on the difference between the fair market value of our assets and their tax basis as of the ownership change date. Because of the NUBIL, certain deductions recognized during the five-year period beginning on the date of the IRC Section 382 ownership change (the \u201crecognition period\u201d) are subject to the same limitation as the net operating loss carryforwards. The recognition period ended on October 31, 2013.\nOur acquisition of Digiplex triggered an ownership change for Digiplex during the third quarter of 2014. We have evaluated the impact of this ownership change and has determined at the acquisition date that Digiplex had a net unrealized built-in gain and was therefore not subject to an RBIL limitation. Therefore, we do not believe that the ownership change will significantly limit our ability to utilize net operating losses acquired from Digiplex.\nWhile we recently reversed the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, we may not be able to realize these assets in the future and they may be subject to additional valuation allowances, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nDuring 2007, we established a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets, primarily due to the realization of significant losses and uncertainty regarding the amount of future taxable income that we could forecast. Management assesses the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets at each\nIndex to Financial Statements\nreporting date. The determination of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate is subject to considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence. At December 31, 2012, based on the weight of all the positive and negative evidence, management concluded that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets of $86.5 million would be realized based upon future taxable income and therefore, we reversed the valuation allowance at December 31, 2012.\nManagement\u2019s conclusion at December 31, 2014 that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized is partially based upon management\u2019s estimate of future taxable income. Management\u2019s estimate of future taxable income is based on internal projections which consider historical performance, various internal estimates and assumptions, as well as certain external data, all of which management believes to be reasonable although inherently subject to significant judgment. If actual results differ significantly from the current estimates of future taxable income, a valuation allowance may need to be established for some or all of our deferred tax assets. Establishing an allowance on our net deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruption or non-renewal of our relationship with our primary concession suppliers could harm our margins on concessions.\nWe purchase substantially all of our concession supplies, except for beverage supplies, as well as janitorial supplies from CCSI, and we are a significant customer of CCSI. In return for our concession supplies, we pay CCSI at prices that are based on the type of concession supplied. If this relationship were disrupted, we could be forced to negotiate substitute arrangements with alternative vendors which are likely to be, in the aggregate, less favorable to us.\nWe purchase substantially all of our beverage supplies from The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company periodically raises beverage supply costs, which have historically not exceeded 10% annually. Our margins on concessions revenue may decline to the extent we are unable to pass on increases in our concession costs to our customers in a rate at or near the rate of cost increases.\nOur development of new theatres poses a number of risks.\nWe plan to continue to expand our operations through the development of new theatres and the expansion of existing theatres. We anticipate our development activities in 2015 will consist of up to six theatres. Developing new theatres requires a significant amount of time and resources and poses a number of risks. Construction of new theatres may result in cost overruns, delays or unanticipated expenses related to zoning or tax laws. Contractors may have difficulty in obtaining financing for construction. We face significant competition for potential theatre locations. Desirable sites for new theatres may be unavailable or expensive, and the markets in which new theatres are located may deteriorate over time. Additionally, the market potential of new theatre sites cannot be precisely determined, and our theatres may face competition in new markets from unexpected sources. Newly constructed theatres may not perform up to our expectations.\nIf we determine that assets are impaired, we will be required to recognize a charge to earnings.\nThe opening of large multiplexes and theatres with stadium seating by us and certain of our competitors has tended to, and is expected to continue to, draw audiences away from certain older theatres, including some of our theatres. In addition, demographic changes and competitive pressures can lead to the impairment of a theatre.\nWe perform our theatre impairment analysis at the individual theatre level, the lowest level of independent, identifiable cash flow. We review all available evidence when assessing long-lived assets for potential impairment, including negative trends in theatre-level cash flow, the impact of competition, the age of the theatre and alternative uses of the assets. Our evaluation of negative trends in theatre-level cash flow considers seasonality of the business, with significant revenues and cash-flow being generated in the summer and year-end\nholiday season. Absent any unusual circumstances, we evaluate new theatres for potential impairment only after such theatres have been open and operational for a sufficient period of time to allow the market to mature.\nIndex to Financial Statements When an impairment indicator or triggering event has occurred, we estimate future, undiscounted theatre-level cash flow using assumptions based on historical performance and our internal budgets and projections, adjusted for market specific facts and circumstances. If the undiscounted cash flow is not sufficient to support recovery of the asset group\u2019s carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value of the asset group. Fair value is determined primarily by discounting the estimated future cash flow, at a rate commensurate with the related risk. Significant judgment is required in estimating future cash flow, and significant assumptions include attendance levels, admissions and concessions pricing and the weighted average cost of capital. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. We had long-lived asset impairment charges, from our continuing operations, in each of the last five fiscal years totaling $21.7 million. For fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, our impairment charges from our continuing operations were $3.2 million, $3.7 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\nOur business makes us vulnerable to fears of terrorism, other forms of mass violence or health-related epidemics, which could cause customers to avoid crowded settings.\nFears of unexpected events including terrorist attacks or other forms of mass violence aimed at crowded settings or health-related epidemics, such as influenza outbreaks, could cause people to avoid theatres or other public places where crowds are in attendance. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, flooding, tornados or earthquakes, could hinder our ability to operate one or more of our theatres. Any of these events, or fears of these events, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud and our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nDeficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company not approved by the Board of Directors, even if the change in control were in the stockholders\u2019 interests. Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. While we have no present intention\nIndex to Financial Statements\nto issue shares of preferred stock, an issuance of preferred stock in the future could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, our bylaws provide that the request of stockholders owning 66 2/3% of our capital stock then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote is required for stockholders to request a special meeting.\nFurther, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to the stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89386, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "CKEC"}
