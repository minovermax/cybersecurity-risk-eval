{"cik": "1130713", "company": "OVERSTOCK.COM, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nPlease consider the following risk factors carefully. If any one or more of the following risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities could decrease significantly. Statements below to the effect that an event could or would harm our business (or have an adverse effect on our business or similar statements) mean that the event could or would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could or would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Many of the risks we face involve more than one type of risk. Consequently, you should read all of the risk factors below carefully before making any decision to acquire or hold our common stock or preferred stock. Virtually all of the risks of holding our common stock are also risks for holding our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock.\nHolders of, and potential investors in, our Series A Preferred Stock should also read \"Additional Risks Related Primarily to our Series A Preferred Stock,\" and \"Additional Risks Related to our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock,\" below.\nHolders of, and potential investors in, our Series B Preferred Stock should also read \"Additional Risks Related to our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock,\" below.\nHolders of, and potential investors in, the tZERO Security Tokens issued by tZERO Group, Inc. should also read \"Additional Risks Related to our tZERO Security Tokens,\" below.\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, and all other information in this Form 10-K and in any reports we file with the SEC after we file this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase or hold our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. The occurrence of any of the risks described in this Form 10-K could harm our business. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Company and to Our Current Review of Strategic Initiatives\nWe have a history of significant losses. If we do not achieve profitability or generate positive cash flow from operations in the near future, our ability to continue in business will depend on our ability to raise additional capital, obtain financing or monetize significant assets, and we may be unable to do so.\nWe have a history of significant losses and our losses have accelerated in recent years, particularly 2018, and we expect to incur operating and net losses in the foreseeable future. Net cash used in operating activities were $138.9 million during 2018, and at December 31, 2018 our accumulated deficit was $458.9 million. Our losses have accelerated in recent years, particularly in 2018, and we may not be able to achieve profitability promptly or at all. We are working to improve the efficiency of our operations but may be unable to do so. Recent staff reductions we have made and additional cost reductions we may implement in the future may adversely affect our business operations. If we are unable to successfully manage our business while reducing our expenses, our ability to continue in business could depend on our ability to raise sufficient additional capital, obtain sufficient financing, or sell or otherwise monetize significant assets such as our corporate headquarters. We do not expect to be able to obtain significant debt financing in the near future. Additionally, we may not be able to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe have significant negative working capital.\nOur net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was a negative $26.2 million at December 31, 2018 compared to a positive $50.5 million at December 31, 2017. Additionally, any significant declines in our revenues could result in decreases in our working capital, which would further reduce our cash balances. Our failure to generate sufficient revenues or profits or to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe do not have access to any credit facility or other arrangement for borrowing funds.\nWe currently do not have access to a credit facility or to the proceeds of any mortgage indebtedness or other secured or unsecured indebtedness for borrowed money. We may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all. Our lack of any credit facility or other ready access to borrowed funds could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund additional losses in the near future, or to respond to unexpected cash requirements or other liquidity issues that we may face from time to time. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Investment Company Act regulates certain companies that invest in, hold or trade securities. Primarily as a result of a portion of our assets consisting of minority investment positions, we are subject to the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company. Because registration under the Investment Company Act would make it impractical for us to operate our business, we need to avoid becoming subject to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act. To do so, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions and/or strategic initiatives due to those concerns. In addition, events beyond our control, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain of our holdings or adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our subsidiaries, could result in us inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial operations and our ability to continue our business.\nIn February of 2018, we and tZERO each received notice that the staff of the SEC's Division of Enforcement is conducting an investigation and has requested information regarding the tZERO security token offering.\nIn February 2018, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed tZERO and subsequently informed us that it is conducting an investigation and requested that we and our affiliates, including Medici Ventures and tZERO voluntarily provide certain information and documents related to tZERO and the tZERO security token offering in connection with its investigation. In December 2018, we received a follow-up request for information. We are cooperating fully with the SEC in connection with its investigation, which will require the time and attention of tZERO and our personnel and may have an adverse effect on our ability to focus attention on our businesses and our ability to raise capital. In addition, the outcome of the investigation could result in negative publicity for tZERO or us and may have a material adverse effect on us or on the current and future business ventures of tZERO.\nWe are exploring strategic initiatives, and decisions we make could have material adverse effects on our business and the market price of our common stock.\nWe have been and are currently exploring certain strategic initiatives, and decisions we make could change our business fundamentally and increase the risks and uncertainties of our business substantially. We are considering a range of potential transactions, including a sale of our retail business and additional equity or debt financings. There can be no assurance that we will pursue or consummate any strategic transaction or, if consummated, that any such transaction will ultimately be favorable to the Company and its stockholders. Any such transaction could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our exploration of strategic and financing options has required and will continue to require significant time and attention by our management, and the incurrence of significant expenses. Further, our efforts to keep investors informed about our consideration of strategic alternatives may result in distraction and unrest among our employees, which may adversely affect employee engagement, morale and retention and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur recent reduction in workforce may prevent us from executing initiatives to improve the performance of our retail business effectively or at all.\nWe have been and are currently implementing certain initiatives to improve the performance of our retail business, and our recent reduction in workforce could prevent us from engaging in certain initiatives we had previously considered and could prevent us from executing such initiatives effectively. At December 31, 2018, our workforce consisted of approximately 2,060 employees. At March 5, 2019, our workforce had been reduced by approximately 250, or approximately 12%, and consisted of\n1,810 employees. The reduction in our workforce could prevent us from engaging in certain initiatives to improve the performance of our retail business, due to an insufficiency of workforce size or an insufficiency of certain required skills, and could prevent us from executing initiatives effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nIf we sell our retail business, our revenues will decrease substantially, we will need to develop new businesses and sources of revenue, and our business, financial results and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we sell our retail business in order to focus on our efforts on our Medici initiatives, our revenues would decrease to an insignificant amount. Our retail business is a relatively mature and predictable business compared to our Medici initiatives, which have a short history, minimal revenues, significant expenses, significant losses and significant uncertainties, and conduct business in a new and rapidly changing industry. We would continue to bear most of the expenses we currently bear as a publicly held company but would have to build a new business and develop new sources of revenue based on our blockchain initiatives, and there is no assurance that we would be able to do so or, even if we could do so, that our new business could become profitable.\nIf we sell our retail business, we do not expect to make any distribution to stockholders.\nIf we sell our retail business for cash, we currently expect to retain all of the after-tax proceeds of the sale for use in our blockchain initiatives. The decision to retain all of the after-tax proceeds, or to declare a dividend, implement a stock repurchase program, make one or more issuer tender offers or take any other similar action, would be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and would depend on the factors the Board deems relevant at the time. Relevant factors would likely include our capital resources, liquidity, operating results, internal projections and plans at the time. We have incurred significant losses recently, and we have utilized a significant amount of cash in funding of our Medici and tZERO initiatives. We also have plans for Medici and tZERO that will require significant additional funding, and we do not currently expect to make any distribution to stockholders even if we sell the retail business. As a result, the market price of our securities could decrease substantially.\nA sale of our retail business might not be subject to a stockholder vote.\nWhether a sale of our retail business would be subject to a stockholder vote would depend primarily on whether a vote is required by applicable law and whether a buyer would require us to submit it to a vote regardless of the requirements of applicable law. If we make a decision to sell our retail business, we and our Board will evaluate the applicable requirements and other factors we and our Board then deem relevant, but at present we do not expect to submit any transaction to a stockholder vote unless we are required to do so, whether by applicable law or otherwise. If we sell our retail business without submitting the transaction to a vote, we may face claims asserting that we should have submitted it to a vote. In addition, we may not sell our retail business in the foreseeable future or at all. Any developments, lack of developments (or announcements about any developments or lack of developments) could cause the trading prices of our securities to decrease.\nIf we sell our retail business, we could incur a substantial corporate level income tax liability.\nIf we sell our retail business in a transaction taxable to the Company, the corporate level income tax liability to the Company would depend in part on the sales price but could be substantial. If we experience an ownership change due to stock sales by our significant stockholders, the amount of net operating losses or credits that can be used to offset the tax on any gain may be limited. Depending on the sales price and limits that are triggered by an ownership change, any net operating losses and credits we have that might be used to reduce the income tax liability to the Company may be unlikely to reduce the tax liability by a significant amount.\nIf we sell our retail business, our Compensation Committee may accelerate the vesting, in whole or in part, of some or all outstanding restricted stock units under our Equity Incentive Plan.\nIf we sell our retail business, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors may accelerate the vesting, in whole or in part, of some or all outstanding restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. Any such determination would be subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and such factors as the Compensation Committee might then deem relevant. Any such acceleration would result in an increase in the number of shares outstanding and would dilute stockholders' ownership of our company.\nOur discussions with potential bidders for our retail business could result in the compromise of our intellectual property.\nAs a consequence of our discussions with potential bidders for our retail business, it may be possible for potential bidders to misappropriate intellectual property and other confidential information from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nIf we sell our retail business in order to focus on our blockchain initiatives and related efforts, risks relating to our Medici businesses, including our tZERO initiatives, that may be immaterial to us now would likely each become a material risk to us.\nIf we sell our retail business in order to focus on our blockchain initiatives and related efforts, we would immediately become a much smaller company than we are now. Consequently, risks relating to our Medici businesses, including our tZERO initiatives, which may currently be immaterial to us, would in all likelihood each become material risks to us. See \"Additional Risks Relating to Our Medici Business,\" and \"Additional Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives\" below.\nWe engage in related party transactions, which could result in conflicts of interest involving our management.\nWe engage in related party transactions with members of our management and Board of Directors, including with Patrick Byrne and Saum Noursalehi and their affiliates. We also own interests in businesses, including tZERO, in which one or more of our directors, officers and other employees own interests. Related party transactions present conflicts of interest which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur ownership of less than 100% of tZERO and other subsidiaries may cause conflicts of interest.\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures owns 80% of the outstanding common stock of tZERO, and tZERO employees, former employees and others own the balance of the shares. tZERO has issued employee stock options that may further dilute our ownership interest. In addition, tZERO may engage in capital raising activities in the future that could further dilute our ownership interest. To that end, in March 2019, we disclosed that we have executed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding a potential transaction involving an equity investment of up to $100 million in tZERO by GSR Capital and Makara Capital, and are in continuing discussions in furtherance thereof. We cannot be sure that we will be able to complete any such transaction on the contemplated terms or on the desired timeframe, if at all. Medici Ventures also has issued employee stock options that may result in our owning less than 100% of Medici Ventures in the future, which would also reduce our effective interest in tZERO. The boards of directors of tZERO and Medici Ventures must consider the interests of all of their stockholders, and the interests of the individual stockholders may differ from our interests. Any significant divergence between our interests and the interests of other stockholders, who are also likely to be employees, of our majority owned subsidiaries, could result in disagreements regarding business matters and could have an adverse effect on employee morale and on our business.\nThe options granted by Medici Ventures and the options granted by tZERO could reduce our effective ownership of each of them significantly.\nMedici Ventures has granted compensatory options under its stock option plan and sold warrants to purchase Medici common stock. If all of the currently outstanding Medici Ventures options were vested and exercised and all of the currently outstanding warrants were exercised, our ownership of Medici Ventures would decrease from 100% to 90%.\ntZERO has granted compensatory options under its equity incentive plan. If all of the currently outstanding tZERO options were vested and exercised, Medici Ventures\u2019 ownership of tZERO would decrease from 80% to 76%.\nIf all of the currently outstanding Medici Ventures options and warrants and all of the currently outstanding tZERO options were exercised, our effective indirect ownership of tZERO would decrease from 80% to 69%.\nAn equity financing by tZERO, whether involving GSR Capital and/or Makara Capital or otherwise, could accelerate the vesting of the options granted by tZERO.\nThe tZERO equity incentive plan requires the administrator of the plan to accelerate, vest, or cause the lapse of restrictions applicable to awards outstanding under the plan upon a \u201cchange in control\u201d as defined in the plan. For purposes of the tZERO plan, a \u201cchange in control\u201d includes Overstock and any entity or entities directly or indirectly controlled by Overstock becoming the legal or beneficial owner of tZERO shares having less than a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding stock of tZERO. As a result, a sale of tZERO shares, whether involving GSR Capital and/or Makara Capital or\notherwise, could accelerate the vesting of the options granted by tZERO. Further, the exercise of options or warrants issued by Medici Ventures and/or the exercise of vested options issued by tZERO could contribute to or cause the accelerated vesting of any then unvested tZERO options.\nOur subsidiary Medici Land Governance, Inc. is a public benefit corporation.\nOur subsidiary Medici Ventures has formed Medici Land Governance, Inc. (\"MLG\") as a public benefit corporation under Delaware law. Directors of traditional corporations, including Overstock and Medici Ventures, are required to make decisions they believe to be in the best interests of their stockholders. The directors of MLG are required by Delaware law to manage MLG in a manner that balances (1) MLG stockholders' pecuniary interests, (2) the best interests of those materially affected by MLG conduct, and (3) MLG public benefit purpose, which is to promote full financial inclusion, economic advancement, and enfranchisement of individuals, by creating systems using blockchain and other technologies that help individuals prove rightful ownership of assets, capitalize their assets, and establish a formal identity. As a result, MLG may not have the same focus on increasing stockholder value that Overstock and Medici Ventures have, and the duties of the officers and directors of MLG, some of whom also are or will be officers and/or directors of Overstock and/or Medici Ventures, may conflict with the duties of the officers and directors of Medici Ventures and Overstock. Even in the absence of common directors, conflicts of interest may arise.\nMLG does not have a proven business model, does not have revenues or profits, and may require additional capital.\nMLG was formed in mid-2018 and is an early stage company that currently does not generate revenues or profits. Its current projects are being done as pilot projects without charge at MLG\u2019s expense to demonstrate MLG\u2019s capabilities and develop its reputation. Although MLG intends to generate revenues and profits in the future, it has not yet developed a business model. If MLG cannot generate revenues and profits, MLG will require additional capital, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nStrategic relationships, joint ventures, purchases of strategic interests in other companies and acquisitions of other companies involve numerous risks, including increased regulatory and integration risks.\nWe have developed strategic relationships, entered into joint ventures, purchased strategic interests in other companies, and acquired other companies, and we expect to pursue and engage in similar types of activities in the future. Each of these types of business transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the evaluation of business opportunities and risks, including regulatory and integration risks, as well as difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products. These types of transactions can also result in the diversion of management's attention from other business matters, employee retention issues, and the risk of liability for liabilities of acquired companies. We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses, operations, personnel, services, products or other assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. Further, acquisitions may also create a need for additional accounting, tax, compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, and may require us to hire additional personnel to implement, perform and/or monitor such procedures. To the extent our procedures are not adequate to appropriately implement, perform and/or monitor all necessary procedures relating to any new or expanded business, we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction. In addition, we may be unable to sell or otherwise monetize any of the interests or companies or other assets or rights we have acquired or may acquire in the future. We also may be unable to maintain our strategic relationships, including those with joint venture partners, or develop new strategic relationships. The occurrence of any of the foregoing which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nThe potential investment in tZERO contemplated by the Memorandum of Understanding we announced in March 2019 with GSR Capital and Makara Capital may not occur.\nIn March 2019, we disclosed that we had executed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding a potential equity investment of up to $100 million in tZERO to be co-led by GSR Capital and Makara Capital, subject to due diligence, negotiation of binding contracts and regulatory approval. We may not be able to reach agreement on the terms of any such investment. Even if we are able to reach agreement on the terms and enter into a definitive agreement regarding the potential investment, the transaction may not close. Our efforts to reach an agreement and close a transaction will continue to take time and attention from our senior executives, which may have an adverse effect on our business, and if the transaction fails to occur, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe may have additional exposure to claims under Delaware's Abandoned Property Law.\nIn September 2018 we lost a jury trial in Delaware brought on Delaware's behalf alleging that we had violated Delaware's unclaimed property laws by failing to report and turn over to Delaware certain unused gift card balances. The time period covered by the lawsuit was 2004 through 2007. The jury returned a verdict, which we expect to result in a judgment against us of approximately $7.3 million plus attorneys' fees and costs. We may have additional exposure for the time period 2008 through 2014.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets, and we may not be able to realize these assets in the future.\nWe have established a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets, primarily due to realized losses and uncertainty regarding our future taxable income. Determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate requires significant judgment and an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence. At each reporting period, we assess the need for, or the sufficiency of, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.\nWe are currently subject to claims that we have infringed intellectual property rights of third parties and may be subjected to additional infringement claims in the future.\nWe are currently and may in the future be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, by offering allegedly infringing products or otherwise. We have contested and expect to continue to contest claims we consider unfounded rather than settling such claims, even when we expect the costs of contesting the claims to exceed the cost of settlement. Any claims may result in significant expenditure of our financial and managerial resources and may result in us making significant damages or settlement payments or changes to our business. We could be prohibited from using software or business processes, or required to obtain licenses from third parties, which could be expensive or unavailable. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology and to obtain trademark protection for our marks.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates, and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including the law pertaining to trade secrets. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without authorization. In addition, we cannot ensure that others will not independently develop similar intellectual property. Third parties have in the past recruited and may in the future recruit our employees who have had access to our proprietary technologies, processes and operations. These recruiting efforts expose us to the risk that such employees and those hiring them will misappropriate and exploit our intellectual property and trade secrets. We may be unable to protect it, in the United States or elsewhere, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have registered and are pursuing the registration of our key trademarks in the United States and some other countries, some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive registered trademark protection. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available or we may not seek protection in every country in which we market or sell our products and services, including in the United States. Our competitors might adopt product or service marks similar to our marks or might try to prevent us from using our marks. Any claim by another party against us or customer, confusion related to our trademarks, or our failure to obtain trademark registration, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nIf one or more states successfully asserts that we are liable for the collection of sales or other taxes for periods prior to the Supreme Court's recent decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, our business could be harmed.\nPrior to the Supreme Court's recent decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, in which we were a named party, to overturn its 1992 decision in Quill v. North Dakota, we generally did not collect sales or other similar taxes on sales of goods into states where we had no duty to do so under Quill. If any jurisdiction where we did not collect sales or other taxes successfully asserts that we should have done so, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of the ultimate outcome.\nA subsidiary of ours owns the land on which we built our headquarters, and we may incur environmental expense and liabilities.\nIn 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary O.com Land, LLC purchased land near Salt Lake City, Utah on which we have built our new headquarters. The land is part of the Midvale SLAG Superfund Site (\"Site\"), a former Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\") superfund site. O.com Land, LLC is required to follow certain requirements of CERCLA and the consent decree governing remediation of the Site, and its failure to do so could expose us to material environmental liabilities.\nAdditional Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives\nRisks Related to tZERO's Business\ntZERO has a limited operating history, which makes it hard to evaluate its ability to generate revenue through operations, and at the date of this filing, tZERO has not generated revenue from any commercially available blockchain-based application.\ntZERO was formed in 2014 to develop blockchain and financial technology as part of Overstock's Medici initiatives. tZERO's limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its current business and future prospects. tZERO has encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate uses of its limited resources, gaining market acceptance, managing a complex regulatory landscape and developing new products. tZERO's current operating model may require changes in order for it to scale its operations efficiently. Investors in our common stock should consider tZERO's business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties it faces as an early-stage company focused on developing products in the field of financial technology. To date, tZERO has focused on developing its business and exploring opportunities for novel applications of blockchain technology. tZERO has not generated revenue from any commercially available blockchain-based applications. tZERO has generated limited revenue and has accumulated losses since its inception. As such, tZERO's has historically been dependent upon continued financial support from us. If we are unable to generate positive cash flow in our retail business, raise additional capital, obtain financing, or sell or otherwise monetize significant assets, we may be unable to continue funding tZERO at the rate or levels we would otherwise do, which could have a material adverse effect on us and on the current and future business of tZERO.\ntZERO may not successfully develop, launch, market, or sell its DLR Software.\ntZERO anticipates that its first commercially available blockchain-based product will be its DLR Software. The DLR Software is currently in customer production testing, which is being conducted by a third party, and tZERO has not yet entered into any commercial licenses with any licensees. The DLR Software is intended to help broker-dealer licensees with stock inventory to both load and manage their inventory in order to assist short sellers of public securities in establishing that they have located available shares in the U.S. public securities market prior to effecting short sales. The DLR Software is intended to enable licensees to create a blockchain-based record of the shares that the licensee has made available for \"locates\" using customizable DLR Software functionality and of the daily purchases of the right to \"locate\" specifically identified shares for purposes of compliance with regulatory requirements. Although tZERO believes that the DLR Software provides broker-dealers with a better solution than the system currently in use for identifying \"locates,\" the existing system is firmly entrenched and is controlled by firms with substantially greater resources than tZERO or Overstock. tZERO may not successfully develop, launch, market or sell its DLR Software.\nThe commercial viability of the DLR Software is dependent on the ability of broker-dealer licensees to offer the DLR Software as an effective means of satisfying the regulatory obligations of those effecting short sales. Regulation SHO under the Exchange Act (\"Regulation SHO\"), as interpreted and implemented by the SEC, is the principal regulation governing short sales. In preliminary discussions with regulators regarding the application of DLR Software, certain members of the SEC Staff (the \"Staff\") have expressed concerns regarding whether locates issued utilizing the DLR Software would provide customers of broker-dealer licensees with a valid locate for purposes of Regulation SHO unless certain conditions were satisfied by the issuing broker-dealers. The broker-dealer licensees of DLR Software, as the parties issuing locates for purposes of Regulation SHO, will be responsible for ensuring that locates issued using the DLR Software comply with all applicable regulations and satisfy the requirements of Regulation SHO. In the event that compliance with regulatory obligations in utilizing DLR Software proves too burdensome to broker-dealer licensees, the DLR Software may not gain market acceptance among broker-dealers.\nIn addition, the SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities may in the future adopt additional rules and regulations, adopt new or modified interpretations of existing regulations, or take other actions, that may impact those engaging in short selling activity or adversely affect the ability of short-selling customers of broker-dealer licensees to rely on locates generated by the DLR Software in effect at the time. Any governmental or regulatory action that restricts the ability of investors to effect short sales, or to do so in reliance on locates generated by the tZERO DLR Software, could adversely affect the commercial viability of the DLR Software.\nMoreover, tZERO will need to devote significant resources to license sales and marketing efforts in order to convince broker-dealers that licensing the DLR Software will increase their revenues from their stock lending operations and to persuade large pension funds and other entities that hold large amounts of publicly traded securities that providing inventory supply to broker-dealers utilizing the DLR Software will provide access to additional revenue opportunities. tZERO will need to build a sales and marketing function and staff to effectively market the DLR Software. tZERO may be unable to do so, and any sales and marketing function and staff it builds may be unable to successfully market the DLR Software. Further, tZERO may have overestimated the size of the pension crisis and the potential market for the DLR Software, the potential demand for the DLR Software, and the possibility that it will be able to market the DLR Software to potential licensees.\nOnce the DLR Software is released for commercial licensing, tZERO may need to make changes to the specifications of the DLR Software for any number of reasons. In the event that tZERO is unable to develop the DLR Software in a way that realizes those specifications, it is possible that the DLR Software may never generate significant revenue or become profitable for tZERO. Furthermore, despite good faith efforts to develop and complete the launch of the DLR Software and subsequently to maintain it, it is still possible that the DLR Software will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact sales and marketing efforts. There can be no assurance that the DLR Software will ever generate significant revenue or become profitable for tZERO.\ntZERO continues to develop new and existing trading platforms for the Series A Preferred, the tZERO Security Tokens and, ultimately, other issuer's digital securities, but to date has only two Token Trading Systems in operation, both by PRO Securities.\ntZERO continues to develop new and existing Token Trading Systems to trade digital securities, including the Series A Preferred, the tZERO Security Tokens, and, ultimately, other issuer's securities tokens. At the date of this filing, only two Token Trading Systems are operational-in December 2016, the PRO Securities ATS, utilizing the tZERO Platform, partnering with Keystone Capital Corporation (\"Keystone\") and ETC, each SEC-registered broker-dealers and FINRA members, began facilitating trading in the Series A Preferred, and in January 2019, the PRO Securities ATS, again utilizing the tZERO Platform, partnering with Dino and ETC, each SEC-registered broker-dealers and FINRA members, began facilitating private placement resales of tZERO Security Tokens to accredited investors in reliance upon an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(7) of the Securities Act. Separately, in June 2018, tZERO and BOX Digital announced that they had entered into a joint venture intended to develop the Exchange with regulatory approvals that would enable the Exchange to trade security tokens. The Exchange will require approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prior to beginning operations. The development of these and any other Token Trading Systems implicates complex technological considerations and raises numerous legal and regulatory issues that will need to be addressed-likely, in consultation with tZERO's broker-dealer subsidiaries' regulators. As a result of these technological, legal and regulatory considerations, new Token Trading Systems may never be developed and, if developed, may (as may any existing Token Trading System), for a variety of technological, legal and regulatory reasons, never become (or remain) operational. If tZERO is unable to successfully develop viable Token Trading Systems, tZERO's business plans would be materially adversely affected. See \"Risks Related to the Development of the Token Trading Systems\" below.\ntZERO intends to offer services to companies considering or pursuing initial security token offerings but has not yet been engaged to do so.\ntZERO intends to offer services (\"issuer services\"), including offering an issuer services platform, to companies considering or pursuing initial security token offerings. To date, tZERO has not been engaged to provide issuer services to any other company considering or pursuing an initial security token offering, and there can be no assurance that tZERO will launch its issuer services platform or be engaged to provide any issuer services in the future or that any issuer services, if provided, will be profitable. If tZERO is engaged to provide any issuer services, tZERO could face claims from any dissatisfied clients and could incur liabilities in rendering any issuer services, any of which could also damage our reputation and adversely affect other parts of our business.\nPRO Securities and SpeedRoute, two subsidiaries of tZERO that currently generate substantially all of tZERO's revenues, are registered broker-dealers and are subject to extensive regulation.\nBroker-dealers are subject to extensive regulatory requirements under federal and state laws and regulations and self-regulatory organization (\u201cSRO\u201d) rules. PRO Securities and SpeedRoute are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Exchange Act and in the states in which they conduct securities business and are members, and subject to the rules, of FINRA. In addition, PRO Securities owns and operates the PRO Securities ATS, which has filed a Form ATS with the SEC notifying the SEC of its activities as an alternative trading system. PRO Securities and SpeedRoute are subject to regulation, examination,\ninvestigation and disciplinary action by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and SROs with which they are registered or licensed or of which they are a member.\nPRO Securities and SpeedRoute currently generate substantially all of tZERO's revenues. Any failure of PRO Securities or SpeedRoute to comply with all applicable rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\nOur broker dealers and tZERO are involved in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities.\nOur broker dealers, PRO Securities and SpeedRoute, and tZERO have been and remain involved in ongoing oral and written communications with regulatory authorities in connection with ongoing examinations, inquiries, or investigations. Any failure of our broker dealers or tZERO to satisfy FINRA, the SEC, or any other regulatory authority with which they must comply could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\nTechnology on which tZERO relies for its operations, including the technology underlying the Token Trading Systems, may not function properly.\nThe technology on which tZERO and its licensees rely, including the technology underlying the Token Trading Systems, may not function properly, which would have a material adverse effect on tZERO's plans, operations and financial condition. Although the tZERO Platform has worked for the Series A shares and the tZERO Security Tokens, trading in these securities has been extremely limited, and consequently the tZERO Platform has not been tested with significant trading volume. If the technology does not work as anticipated, there may be no alternative available. The importance of the technology to tZERO's operations means that any problems in its functionality would have a direct materially adverse effect on tZERO's plans and expectations for revenues from blockchain applications. The technology may malfunction because of internal problems or as a result of cyber-attacks or external security breaches. Any such technological problems would have a material adverse effect on tZERO's prospects.\nAcquisitions tZERO has made and may make will increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.\nFrom time to time tZERO has purchased interests in or acquired other businesses or the assets of other businesses and may do so again in the future. Integrating an acquired business or its assets involves a number of risks and financial, managerial and operational challenges. tZERO may incur significant expenses in connection with purchases or acquisitions it has made in the past or may make in the future. Further, acquisitions may also create a need for additional accounting, tax, compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, and may require tZERO to hire additional personnel to implement, perform and/or monitor such procedures. To the extent tZERO's procedures are not adequate to appropriately implement, perform and/or monitor all necessary procedures relating to any new or expanded business, we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\ntZERO's acquisition of Bitsy Inc. may expose us to additional risks.\nEffective January 2019, tZERO purchased the remaining 67% interest in Bitsy, Inc. for $8 million, bringing our total equity interest in Bitsy, Inc. to 100%. Bitsy, Inc., is a U.S.-based company founded and partially owned by Medici Ventures' former chief operating officer and general counsel, and current president of tZERO, Steve Hopkins. In September 2018, Bitsy announced that it had begun a limited beta launch of a digital wallet service intended to create a bridge between traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Various aspects of the business that Bitsy is engaging in are heavily regulated. Virtually every state in the U.S. regulates money transmitters and money services businesses. In some states the licensing requirements and regulations expressly cover companies engaged in digital currency activities; in other states it is not clear whether or how the existing laws and regulations apply to digital currency activities. These licenses and registrations subject companies to various anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, record-keeping, reporting and capital and bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies. Bitsy has registered with FinCEN and intends to obtain all licenses it is required to obtain. Under U.S. federal law, it is a crime for a person, entity or business that is required to be registered with FinCEN or licensed in any state to fail to do so. Further, under U.S. federal law, anyone who owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.\nAdditional Risks Related to our tZERO Security Tokens\nThe IRS may disagree with our characterization of the tZERO Security Token offering, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nAlthough we have taken the position that the sale of the tZERO Security Tokens in the security token offering was a sale of equity for tax purposes, if the IRS disagrees with our characterization and instead requires us to treat the proceeds as income to us for federal income tax purposes, this would reduce our federal net operating loss carryforwards by approximately $104.8 million as a result of the security token offering. In addition, if we are required to treat the proceeds of the security token offering as a liability rather than equity for accounting purposes, that would reduce tZERO's net book value compared to equity treatment.\nWe are subject to the risks of holding tZERO Security Tokens and the risk that we will be unable to sell the tZERO Security Tokens.\nAs part of tZERO's Security Token offering, we elected to accept tZERO Security Tokens in payment of $30 million of tZERO's indebtedness to us. As a holder of restricted securities, we therefore are subject to all of the risks of holding the tZERO Security Tokens, including the risk that we will be unable to publicly resell any of the tZERO Security Tokens unless tZERO registers our resale for us under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We do not have any contractual rights to require tZERO to do so.\nThe tZERO Security Tokens may be subject to registration under the Exchange Act if tZERO has assets above $10 million and more than a statutory amount of registered token holders, which would increase tZERO's costs significantly and require substantial attention from tZERO's management.\nCompanies with total assets above $10 million and more than 2,000 holders of record of their equity securities, or 500 holders of record of its equity securities who are not accredited investors, at the end of their fiscal year must register that class of equity securities with the SEC under the Exchange Act. If tZERO is required to register the tZERO Security Tokens with the SEC under the Exchange Act, it would be a laborious and expensive process. Furthermore, if such registration takes place, tZERO would have materially higher compliance and reporting costs going forward.\nRisks Related to the Development of the Token Trading Systems\nDevelopment of Token Trading Systems pose financial, technological, and regulatory challenges and tZERO may not be able to successfully develop, market and launch any particular Token Trading System.\nThe development of a Token Trading System requires significant capital funding, expertise of tZERO's management and time and effort in order to be successful. For any particular Token Trading System, tZERO may have to make changes to the specifications for any number of reasons or tZERO may be unable to develop the Token Trading System in a way that realizes those specifications or any form of a functioning network. A Token Trading System, even if successfully developed and maintained, may not meet investor expectations-for example, there can be no assurance that a Token Trading System will provide less expensive or more efficient trading than is possible on currently available trading platforms for traditional securities (or even other Token Trading Systems for digital securities). Furthermore, a Token Trading System may experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact that Token Trading System and the digital securities traded on that Token Trading System.\ntZERO may not have or may not be able to obtain the technical skills, expertise, or regulatory approvals needed to successfully develop any particular Token Trading System and progress it to a successful launch. While tZERO has sought to retain and continue to competitively recruit experts, there may, from time to time, be a general scarcity of management, technical, scientific, research and marketing personnel with appropriate training to develop and maintain development of Token Trading Systems. In addition, there are significant legal and regulatory considerations that will need to be addressed in order to develop and maintain each Token Trading System, including the qualifications of licensees operating each Token Trading system, and addressing such considerations will require significant time and resources. There can be no assurance that tZERO will be able to develop Token Trading Systems that fully achieve tZERO's goals and satisfy the complex regulatory requirements applicable to SEC-registered exchanges and/or permitted alternative trading systems. If tZERO is not successful in its efforts to develop Token Trading Systems that are compliant with all regulatory and legal requirements and to demonstrate to users the utility and value of Token Trading Systems, it may be impermissible to launch a particular Token Trading System or\nthere may not be sufficient demand for the digital securities required for a particular Token Trading System to be commercially viable, and tZERO's business would be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRegulatory authorities may never permit a Token Trading System to become operational.\nDepending on the particular Token Trading System, numerous regulatory authorities, including FINRA and the SEC, may need to permit the Token Trading System to become operational. If FINRA, the SEC or any other regulatory authority objected to the Token Trading System or to aspects of the Token Trading System, such regulatory authorities could prevent the Token Trading System from ever becoming operational. The regulatory landscape that tZERO, its broker-dealer subsidiaries, and its partners need to navigate in order to achieve an operational Token Trading System is complex, and tZERO may never be able to do so successfully for a particular Token Trading System. Any such regulatory issues would have a material adverse impact on tZERO's business.\nToken Trading Systems may not be widely adopted and may have limited users.\nIt is possible that Token Trading Systems will not be used by a large number of issuers, broker-dealers or holders of security tokens or that there will be limited public interest in the continued creation and development of Token Trading Systems. In addition, legal and regulatory developments could render any of the Token Trading Systems obsolete or impermissible. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the continued development of Token Trading Systems and the business and financial position of tZERO and have a material adverse effect on us.\nAlternative networks may be established that compete with or are more widely used than the Token Trading Systems.\nIt is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same or similar protocols as those underlying the Token Trading Systems or that facilitate services that are materially similar to the Token Trading Systems' services. The Token Trading Systems may face competition from any such alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Token Trading Systems and have a material adverse effect on tZERO and on us.\nThe tZERO Platform and the Token Trading Systems, and any blockchain technology on which they rely, may be the target of cyber-attacks or may contain exploitable flaws in its underlying code, which may result in security breaches and the loss or theft of securities that trade on the Token Trading Systems. If such attacks occur or security is compromised, this could expose us to liability and reputational harm and could seriously curtail the utilization of security tokens and cause a decline in the market price of the affected securities and could result in claims against tZERO or us.\nThe Token Trading Systems, its structural foundation (including the tZERO Platform), and the software applications and other interfaces or applications upon which they rely (including blockchain technology), are unproven, and there can be no assurances that the Token Trading Systems and the creating, transfer or storage of securities on that system will be uninterrupted or fully secure, which may result in impermissible transfers, a complete loss of investors' securities on that system or an unwillingness of market participants to access, adopt and utilize security tokens or the Token Trading Systems. Further, the tZERO Platform, the Token Trading Systems and any technology, including blockchain technology, on which they rely, may also be the target of cyber-attacks (such as \"double-spend\" attacks or \"51%\" attacks) seeking to identify and exploit weaknesses, which may result in the loss or theft of securities, which, in turn, may materially and adversely affect the Token Trading Systems, tZERO, and us.\nSome market participants may oppose the development of distributed ledger or blockchain-based systems like those central to tZERO's commercial mission, which could adversely affect tZERO.\nMany participants in the system currently used for trading public securities in the United States may oppose the development of capital markets systems and processes that utilize distributed ledger and blockchain-based systems. The market participants who may oppose such a system may include entities with significantly greater resources, including financial resources and political influence, than tZERO or we have. The ability of tZERO to operate and achieve its commercial goals could be adversely affected by any actions of any such market participants that result in additional regulatory requirements or other activities that make it more difficult for tZERO to operate could adversely affect tZERO's ability to achieve its commercial goals, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Blockchain Technology\nThe regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, the tZERO Platform and offerings of digital assets is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development and the value of such cryptocurrencies and assets.\nRegulation of digital assets, like the tZERO Security Tokens, as well as cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and the Token Trading Systems, is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of tokens generally and the technology behind them or the means of transaction or in transferring them. Failure by tZERO and its Token Trading System partners to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.\nCryptocurrency networks, distributed ledger technologies, and coin and token offerings also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, China and Russia. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that may conflict with those of the United States or may directly and negatively impact tZERO's business. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and materially adverse to tZERO's business.\nThe further development and acceptance of blockchain networks, which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain assets would have a material adverse effect on tZERO's business plans and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the blockchain networks on which the tZERO Security Tokens will rely, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the cryptocurrency and digital security industry, as well as blockchain networks, include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nworldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies, digital securities, and other blockchain technologies;\n\u2022\ngovernment and quasi-government regulation of cryptocurrencies, digital securities, and other blockchain assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of cryptocurrency or digital securities networks;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\u2022\nthe availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using government-backed currencies or existing networks;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies and digital securities; and\n\u2022\na decline in the popularity or acceptance of cryptocurrencies or other blockchain-based tokens.\nThe cryptocurrency and digital securities industries as a whole have been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and are constantly evolving. Although it has experienced significant growth in recent years, the slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks and blockchain assets may materially adversely affect tZERO's business plans.\nThe prices of digital assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of digital assets could materially and adversely affect tZERO's business.\nThe prices of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, and other digital assets have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. A decrease in the price of a single digital asset may cause volatility in the entire digital asset and security token industry. For example, a security breach that affects purchaser or user confidence in Bitcoin or Ether may affect the industry as a whole. This volatility may adversely affect interest in and demand for the Token Trading System, which would materially adversely affect tZERO's business.\ntZERO's and its subsidiaries' businesses are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, technology, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to their business practices, increased cost of operations or otherwise harm their businesses.\ntZERO and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to its business, including user privacy, blockchain technology, data protection and intellectual property, among others. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which tZERO and its subsidiaries operate.\ntZERO and its subsidiaries have adopted appropriate policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws. The growth of their respective businesses and expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or its internal policies and procedures. The risk of being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of these have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against tZERO or its subsidiaries for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if tZERO or its subsidiaries successfully defend against it, could cause tZERO or any of its subsidiaries to incur significant legal expenses and divert its management's attention from the operation of its business. If its operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, it may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, it could be required to refund payments received by it, and it could be required to curtail or cease its operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm tZERO's or any of its subsidiaries' business and its financial results. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase tZERO's or any of its subsidiaries' operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject any of them to claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that they modify or cease existing business practices.\nThe popularity of cryptocurrencies and digital securities offerings may decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the cryptocurrency and digital securities industry and tZERO's operations and financial condition.\ntZERO was founded to develop and commercialize financial technology based on the use of digital assets, digital securities and blockchain technology. In recent years, cryptocurrencies and digital securities have become more widely accepted among investors and financial institutions but have been also faced increasingly complex legal and regulatory challenges and, to date, have not benefited from widespread adoption by governments, central banks or established financial institutions. However, any significant decrease in the acceptance or popularity of cryptocurrency or digital security offerings may have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\nTo date, tZERO's primary source of revenues has been revenues from its wholly owned subsidiaries, SpeedRoute and PRO Securities, and a large percentage of these firms' revenues come from a small number of major customers, making tZERO vulnerable to changes in the business and financial condition of, or demand for SpeedRoute's and PRO Securities' services by, such customers.\nTo date, tZERO's primary source of revenues has been revenues from its wholly owned subsidiaries, SpeedRoute and PRO Securities. These firms' revenues primarily have come from three major customers, making tZERO vulnerable to changes in the business and financial condition of, or demand for services by, such customers of SpeedRoute and PRO Securities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, revenue passed through to tZERO from the broker-dealers attributable to these three customers accounted for, respectively, 23%, 15% and 11% of tZERO's revenues. tZERO's income and ability to meet its financial obligations could also be adversely affected in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or significant downturn in the business of one of these SpeedRoute or PRO Securities customers.\nThe tZERO Platform and any current or future Token Trading Systems have been and will be, as applicable, developed by key technology employees of tZERO and its affiliates, and their operation and further development depend on the continued availability of those key employees.\nThe tZERO Platform, and any current or future Token Trading System, including technology and intellectual property involved in their creation and operation, have been or will be, as applicable, developed primarily by a small number of key technology employees of tZERO and its affiliates. The loss of the services of any of those key employees could have a material adverse effect on the ability of tZERO to develop, operate or maintain the tZERO Platform or the Token Trading Systems. If\ntZERO were to lose the services of any such key employees, it could be difficult or impossible to replace them, and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in claims against tZERO and us and could have a material adverse effect on us and the holders of our securities.\nThe development and operation of tZERO's business, including the tZERO Platform and any Token Trading System requires, will likely require, technology and intellectual property rights.\nThe ability of tZERO to develop tZERO Platform and any Token Trading System that may be developed in the future may depend on technology and intellectual property rights that tZERO may license from unaffiliated third parties. If for any reason tZERO were to fail to comply with its obligations under an applicable license agreement, or were unable to provide or were to fail to provide the technology and intellectual property that the tZERO Platform or any Token Trading System requires, they would be unable to operate, which would have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on us.\ntZERO may face substantial competition from a number of known and unknown competitors as well as the risk that one or more of them may obtain patents covering technology critical to the operation of the tZERO Platform or any Token Trading System.\nWe believe that a number of organizations are or may be working to develop trading systems utilizing distributed ledger or blockchain technologies or other novel technologies that may be competitive with tZERO's own technology, including its patented technology. Although it is difficult to obtain reliable information about blockchain activities by companies that may be our competitors, they may include companies such as SharesPost, OpenFinance Network, Templum Inc., Coinbase, KoreConX, Blocktrade AG, Smart Valor, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Intercontinental Exchange, Circle, Ideanomics, CrowdEngine, Securitize, Harbor, and Polymath. As our industry matures, we expect that larger existing companies in the financial services and technology industry, including companies offering services and products related to e-commerce, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, online advertising, search engines, software, and hardware may enter the digital securities secondary trading and digital securities exchange areas of our current business and other areas of our potential business related to distributed ledger or blockchain technologies and compete. Any or all of them may compete with us now or in the near future not only for potential business, but for the time and attention of regulators and for the services of persons with the expertise we need. Some or all of such organizations may have substantially greater technological expertise, experience with distributed ledger technologies and/or financial resources than tZERO or Overstock has, and many of them appear to be attempting to patent technologies that may be competitive with or similar to the technology tZERO has developed and patented. tZERO does not have access to detailed information about the technologies these organizations and/or their respective purchasers may be attempting to patent. If one or more other persons, companies or organizations obtains a valid patent covering technology critical to the tZERO Platform or any Token Trading System, the tZERO partners that need the relevant technology in order to enable the tZERO Platform or any Token Trading System to operate as intended might be unable or unwilling to license the technology, and it could become impossible for the tZERO Platform or any Token Trading System to operate, which could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us. Further, tZERO\u2019s subsidiaries may also face competition in the areas of their respective businesses including accredited investor verification services, money services, or broker dealer services, and these competitors may include Early IQ, InvestReady.com, CharlesSchwab, the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, CBOE, Clearpool Group, Dash Financial Technologies, Coinbase, SpectroCoin, Robinhood, Cash App, Abra, and Kraken. Any or all of them may compete with tZERO\u2019s subsidiaries now for current business or in the near future for potential business.\nAdditional Risks Relating to Our Retail Business\nOur business depends on the Internet, our infrastructure and transaction-processing systems.\nWe are completely dependent on our infrastructure and on the availability, reliability and security of the Internet and related systems. Substantially all of our computer and communications hardware is located at a single Overstock owned and operated facility. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. Our back-up facility is not adequate to support sales at a high level. Our servers and applications are vulnerable to malware, physical or electronic break-ins and other disruptions, the occurrence of any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders. Any system interruption that results in the unavailability of our Website or our mobile app or reduced performance of our transaction systems could interrupt or substantially reduce our ability to conduct our business. We have experienced periodic systems interruptions due to server failure, application failure, power\nfailure and intentional cyber-attacks in the past, and may experience additional interruptions or failures in the future. Any failure or impairment of our infrastructure or of the availability of the Internet or related systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe rely upon paid and unpaid natural search engines to rank our product offerings, and our financial results may suffer if we are unable to regain our prior rankings in natural searches.\nWe rely on paid and unpaid natural search engines to attract consumer interest in our product offerings, including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. Changes to their ranking algorithms may further adversely affect our product offerings in paid and/or unpaid searches, and we may at times be subject to ranking penalties if the operators of search engines believe we are not in compliance with their guidelines. Search engine companies change their natural search engine algorithms periodically, and our ranking in natural searches may be adversely affected by those changes, as has occurred from time to time, and which have led us to pursue revenue growth in other more expensive marketing channels. Google's search engine is dominant in our business and has historically been a significant source of traffic to our website, much of it at essentially no incremental cost to us. If the changes we believe Google made in 2017 prevent us from regaining our prior rankings in Google's natural search engine, we will have to utilize more expensive marketing channels or otherwise compensate for the loss of some of the natural search traffic, and if we are unable to do so, our financial results may suffer and the changes may have a material adverse effect on our business. Search engine companies may also determine that we are not in compliance with their guidelines from time to time, as has occurred in the past, and they may penalize us in their search algorithms as a result.\nOur business depends on effective marketing, including marketing via email and social networking messaging and our competitors have and may continue to directly increase our marketing costs and also have and may continue to cause us to decrease certain types of marketing.\nWe depend on effective marketing and high customer traffic. We depend on email to promote our site and offerings and to generate a substantial portion of our revenue. If a significant portion of our target customers no longer utilize email, or if we are unable to effectively and economically deliver email to our potential customers, whether for legal, regulatory or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. We also rely on social networking messaging services for marketing purposes, and anything that limits our ability or our customers' ability or desire to utilize social networking services could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to competing with us for customers, suppliers, and employees, our competitors have and may continue to directly increase our operating costs, by driving up the cost of various forms of online advertising. We may elect to decrease our use of sponsored search or other forms of marketing from time to time in order to decrease our costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business. We may also elect to spend additional amounts on sponsored search or other forms of marketing from time to time in order to increase traffic to our Website, or to take other actions to increase traffic and/or conversion. If we are unable to develop, improve, implement and maintain effective and efficient cost-effective advertising and marketing programs, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nSome shoppers may not utilize the search engines at all, and we may be unable to reach some of those shoppers.\nLarge marketplace websites and sites which aggregate marketplace sellers with a large product selection are becoming increasingly popular, and we may not be able to place our products on these sites to take advantage of their internal search platforms. Further, some shoppers may begin their searches at a competitor's website and may not utilize traditional search engines at all. Our inability to place products on or access these sites may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and risks of data loss or other security breaches.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of users' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and to resulting claims, fines, and litigation. We have been subjected to a variety of cyber-attacks, which have increased in number and variety over time. We believe our systems are probed by potential hackers virtually 24/7, and we expect the problem will continue to grow worse over time. Cyber-attacks may target us, our customers, our suppliers, banks, credit card processors, delivery services, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business. Moreover, any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate to cover the expenses and other potential financial exposure we could face as a result of a cyber-attack or data breach.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors.\nThe online retail market is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive. Barriers to entry are minimal, and current and new competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost. We currently compete with numerous competitors, including:\n\u2022\nonline retailers with or without discount departments, including Amazon.com, AliExpress (part of the Alibaba Group), eBay, and Rakuten.com (formerly Buy.com);\n\u2022\nonline shopping services, including Google Express;\n\u2022\nonline specialty retailers such as Blue Nile, Bluefly, Houzz, Jet.com, Wayfair, Zappos.com, and Zulily;\n\u2022\nfurniture specialists including Ashley Furniture, Bob's Discount Furniture, Havertys, Raymour & Flanigan and Rooms To Go;\n\u2022\ntraditional general merchandise and specialty retailers and liquidators including Barnes and Noble, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Costco, Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, Gilt, Home Depot, HomeGoods, Hudson's Bay Company, IKEA, J.C. Penney Company, Kirkland's, Kohl's, Lands' End, Lowe's, Macy's, Nordstrom, Pier 1 Imports, Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Ross Stores, Saks Fifth Avenue, Sears, T.J. Maxx, Target, Wal-Mart, and Williams-Sonoma, all of which also have an online presence; and\n\u2022\nonline liquidators such as SmartBargains.\nWe expect that existing and future traditional manufacturers and retailers will continue to add or improve their e-commerce offerings, and that our existing and future e-commerce competitors, including Amazon, will continue to increase their offerings, their delivery capabilities, and the ways in which they enable shoppers to purchase goods, including their mobile technology and the voice-activated shopping services offered by Amazon. Many of our competitors specialize in one or more of the areas in which we offer products. For example, our furniture offerings compete with more than 100 online retail furniture websites, in addition to many more traditional furniture retail specialists. Some of our competitors run at net losses to gain market share in the online retail market. We also face competition from shopping services such as Google Express, which offers products from Walmart, Costco, Target and other retailers on a voice-activated shopping platform. Competition from Amazon and from other competitors, many of whom have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, greater access to capital and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, affect us and have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nTariffs or other measures that increase the effective price of products we or our suppliers or fulfillment partners import into the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and many of our suppliers and fulfillment partners source a large percentage of the products we offer on our Website from China and other countries. If the United States imposes tariffs or other measures that directly or indirectly increase the price of products we or they import and that we offer on our Website, the increased prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nEconomic factors, including our increasing exposure to the U.S. housing industry, may adversely affect us.\nEconomic conditions, particularly any weakness in the United States housing market, may adversely affect our financial performance. Over the last several years, the percentage of our sales from home and garden products has increased substantially. We believe that our sales of home and garden products are affected by the strength of the U.S. housing industry, and that downturns in the U.S. housing industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nDecreases in discretionary consumer spending may adversely affect us.\nA substantial portion of the products and services we offer are products or services that consumers may view as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Difficult macro-economic conditions, particularly high levels of unemployment or underemployment, also impact our customers' ability to obtain consumer credit. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, consumer debt levels, and fuel and energy costs could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. Slowdowns in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, could materially adversely affect consumer spending habits and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur international business efforts could adversely affect us.\nWe sell products in international markets. International sales and transactions are subject to inherent risks and challenges that could adversely affect us, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to develop new supplier and manufacturer relationships;\n\u2022\nthe need to comply with additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in international laws, regulatory requirements, taxes and tariffs;\n\u2022\nour limited experience with different local cultures and standards;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical events, such as war and terrorist attacks;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the products we offer may not appeal to customers in international markets; and\n\u2022\nthe additional resources and management attention required for such expansion.\nOur international business could expose us to penalties for non-compliance with laws applicable to international business and trade, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are different and often more restrictive than those in the United States. Compliance with such laws and regulations will result in additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices, which may adversely affect our business. To the extent that we make purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies, we would have foreign currency risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nIf we do not successfully optimize and operate our warehouse, distribution centers and customer service operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe have expanded, contracted and otherwise modified our warehouse, distribution centers and customer service operations from time to time in the past, and expect that we will continue to do so. If we do not successfully optimize and operate our warehouse, distribution centers and customer service operations, it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand, customer shipping or return time expectations, or result in excessive costs and expenses for the size of our business. Because it is difficult to predict demand, we may not be able to manage our facilities in an optimal way, which may result in excess or insufficient inventory or warehousing capacity. We may also fail to staff our fulfillment and customer service centers at optimal levels. Our failure to manage our warehouse operations, distribution centers or our fulfillment and customer service centers optimally could adversely affect our financial results and customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe depend on a large number of other companies to perform functions critical to our business, and any failure on their part could have a material adverse effect our business.\nWe depend on a large number of other companies, including a large number of independent fulfillment partners whose products we offer for sale on our Website, to perform functions critical to our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We depend on our fulfillment partners to perform a number of traditional retail operations such as maintaining inventory, preparing merchandise for shipment to our customers and delivering purchased merchandise on a timely basis. We also depend on the delivery services that we and they utilize, on the payment processors that facilitate our customers' payments for their purchases, and on other third parties over which we have no control, for the operation of our business. Difficulties with any of our significant fulfillment partners, delivery services, payment processors or other third parties involved in our business, regardless of the reason, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe depend on our suppliers and fulfillment partners representations regarding product safety, content and quality, and for proper labelling of products.\nWe rely on our suppliers' and fulfillment partners' representations of product safety, content and quality. We also rely on our suppliers and partners to ensure proper labelling of products. Issues or concerns regarding product safety, labelling, content or quality could result in consumer or governmental claims and could adversely affect our financial results and business. Any indemnity agreement we may have with a supplier or partner of a product may be inadequate or inapplicable, and any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur decision to accept and hold cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, may subject us to exchange risk and additional tax and regulatory requirements.\nIn 2014, we began accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for purchases on our website. Neither bitcoin nor any of the other cryptocurrencies we may hold are considered legal tender or backed by any government, and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies we may hold have experienced price volatility, technological glitches and various law enforcement and regulatory interventions. The use of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin has been prohibited or effectively prohibited in some countries. If we fail to comply with regulations or prohibitions applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to retain, in bitcoin, up to 50% of our sales revenues paid for by customers in bitcoin. From time to time we hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly, and we have exchange rate risk on the amounts we hold as well as the risks that regulatory or other developments may adversely affect the value of the cryptocurrencies we hold. We may choose not to hedge or may be unable to fully hedge our exposure to cryptocurrencies and may at times be unable to convert cryptocurrencies to U.S. dollars. If any regulatory authority asserts that we require a license or other regulatory approval to conduct business or own an interest in other businesses involving cryptocurrencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nIn addition to our efforts to transition from our historical business as an e-commerce retailer to a blockchain-focused company, we have an evolving e-commerce business model, which increases the complexity of our retail business.\nIn addition to our efforts to transition from our historical business as an e-commerce retailer to a blockchain-focused company as described in this report, our retail business model has evolved in the past and continues to do so. In prior years we added additional types of services and product offerings and in some cases, we modified or discontinued those offerings, and in some cases have re-launched offerings we had previously terminated. We may continue to try to offer additional types of products or services, and we do not know whether any of them will be successful. From time to time we have also modified aspects of our business model relating to our product mix and the mix of direct/partner sourcing of the products we offer. The additions and modifications to our business have increased the complexity of our business and impacted our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. Future additions to or modifications of our business are likely to have similar effects. Further, any new business or website we launch that is not favorably received by consumers could damage our reputation or our brand. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur plans to end our Club O Rewards Mastercard could adversely affect us.\nWe are planning to end our Overstock Club O Rewards Mastercard which offers cardholders a complimentary Club O Rewards membership with a higher reward earning percentage (8%). We anticipate larger than normal rewards redemption from these members during the immediate 60-day grace period following the closure on March 29, 2019 which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in Q2 2019.\nOur insurance coverage and indemnity rights may not adequately protect us against loss.\nThe types, coverage, or the amounts of any insurance coverage we may carry from time to time may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses we may actually incur in the operation of our business. Further, any insurance we may desire to purchase may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable or at all. We are not indemnified by all of our suppliers, and any indemnification rights we may have may not be enforceable or adequate to cover actual losses we may incur as a result of our sales of their products. Actual losses for which we are not insured or indemnified, or which exceed our insurance coverage or the capacity of our indemnitors or our ability to enforce our indemnity agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe are partially self-insured with respect to our employees' health insurance. If the actual costs of these claims exceed the amounts we have reserved for them, we would incur additional expense.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, we are partially self-insured with respect to our employees' health insurance, except to the extent of stop-loss coverage that limits our losses both on a per employee basis and an aggregate basis. The actual costs of our employees' health insurance claims could exceed our estimates of those costs for a number of reasons, including more claims or larger claims than we expect, and increases in the costs of healthcare generally. If the actual cost of our employees' health insurance claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts we have accrued, we may be required to record additional charges for these claims and/or to establish additional reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nAdditional Risks Relating to Our Medici Business\nThe businesses that we are pursuing through our Medici initiatives are novel and subject to technical, operational, financial, regulatory, legal, reputational and marketing risks.\nIn August 2015, we acquired the assets and business of a financial technology (\"fintech\") company and in January 2016, we acquired two registered broker-dealers (our \"broker-dealer subsidiaries\") that were affiliated with the fintech company. We have limited experience with the operation of fintech companies or of broker-dealers. In December 2016, we issued publicly-traded securities traded exclusively on a registered alternative trading system operated by one of our majority-owned broker-dealer subsidiaries, the ownership of which is tracked on a blockchain. Our majority-owned subsidiary tZERO is working on other potential financial applications of blockchain technology, including the potential development of a trading platform for digital \"tokens\" or \"coins\" treated as securities. See \"Additional Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives\" below. These are areas in which we do not have substantial experience, and which are subject to the risks of new and novel businesses, including technical, operational, financial, regulatory, legal and reputational risks, as well as the risk that we may be unable to market, license or sell our technology successfully or profitably. The occurrence of any such risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nWe may be required to write off amounts relating to our interests in startup businesses.\nAt December 31, 2018, Overstock and its subsidiaries held minority interests totaling approximately $60.4 million in several companies that are in the startup or development stages and we may acquire additional minority interests in other entities in the future. These interests are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Additionally, since these interests are in companies that are in the early startup or development stages, even if their technology or products are viable, they may not be able to obtain the capital or resources necessary to successfully bring their technology or products to market. Furthermore, we have no assurance that the technology or products of companies we have funded would be successful, even if they were brought to market. We have written off amounts related to these interests in the past and may in the future write off additional amounts related to these interests. Any such write-offs could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nOur ownership interest in digital currency transfer and payment businesses may expose us to additional risks.\nMedici has acquired equity interests in startup companies which are pursuing a variety of digital currency transfer and payment businesses. Virtually every state in the U.S. regulates money transmitters and money services businesses. In some states the licensing requirements and regulations expressly cover companies engaged in digital currency activities; in other states it is not clear whether or how the existing laws and regulations apply to digital currency activities. Further, U.S. federal law requires registration of most such businesses with FinCEN. These licenses and registrations subject companies to various anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, record-keeping, reporting and capital and bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies. Under U.S. federal law, it is a crime for a person, entity or business that is required to be registered with FinCEN or licensed in any state to fail to do so. Further, under U.S. federal law, anyone who owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. If Bitt, Spera, or FinClusive take any action that could subject them to registration with FinCEN or to licensing requirements in any state before they become properly licensed and registered, we could be subject to potential civil and criminal penalties. Any such penalties, or even the allegation of criminal or other illegal activities, could have a material adverse effect on us and on our financial results and business.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological changes, it may impair our ability to market, license or sell the products and services developed as part of our Medici initiatives.\nThe market for products and services based on blockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service innovation and evolving industry standards. The success of our Medici initiatives depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of such products and services. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our competitiveness and financial results. In addition, we may need to continuously modify and enhance our offerings to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of products and services to keep pace with technological changes or operate effectively with future network\nplatforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nThe blockchain related products and services that we are developing as part of our Medici initiatives have the potential to be used in ways we do not intend, including for criminal or other illegal activities.\nBlockchain related products and services, in particular cryptocurrencies, have the potential to be used for financial crimes or other illegal activities. Because the Medici initiatives are novel there are uncertainties regarding any legal and regulatory requirements for preventing blockchain related products and services from being put to such uses, and there are uncertainties regarding the liabilities and risks to the Company if we are unable to prevent such uses. Even if we comply with all laws and regulations regarding financial and blockchain related products and services, we have no ability to ensure that our customers, partners or others to whom we license or sell our products and services comply with all laws and regulations applicable to them and their transactions. Any negative publicity we receive regarding any allegations of unlawful uses of our Medici initiatives could damage our reputation. More generally, any negative publicity regarding unlawful uses of blockchain technology in the marketplace could reduce the demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Other Securities\nIf we determine not to sell our retail business or make other fundamental changes to our business, the trading prices of our securities may decrease significantly. The trading prices of our securities may also decrease significantly if we determine to take any such actions.\nThe trading prices of our common stock and other securities have been and may continue to be volatile. Our stock price fluctuations may be due in part to our disclosures about our exploration of strategic alternatives. Our stock price may be adversely affected by our future actions, including any decisions we may make or announcements to pursue or not to pursue such strategic alternatives, and by any announcements we may make regarding any such matters, any of which could cause the trading prices of our securities to decrease significantly which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nThe trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected by short-selling activities involving our common stock.\nThe trading prices of our common stock and other securities have been and may continue to be volatile. Our stock price fluctuations may be due in part to short-selling activity related to our common stock. The practice of short-selling activity may adversely affect our common stock price, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nThe trading prices of our securities may be affected by the prices of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, despite our disclosures that we generally hold very little Bitcoin, and by perceptions regarding the business prospects of blockchain technology generally.\nThe trading prices of our securities may be affected by the prices of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which may be the result of an apparent misperception that the value of our business is related to the value of Bitcoin, despite our disclosures that we generally hold very little Bitcoin. The market price of our securities may also be affected by perceptions regarding the business prospects of our Medici business and blockchain technology generally. To the extent that our blockchain initiatives do not succeed in a timely manner or at all, or the development or acceptance of blockchain networks, blockchain assets or blockchain applications slows or stops, the trading prices of our securities could decrease significantly, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and you may lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, holders of our common stock will not receive any funds without selling their shares. You may not receive a positive return on your investment, and you may lose your entire investment.\nSales by our significant stockholders could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common and preferred stock.\nA small number of our stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock. Our Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne is the beneficial owner of approximately 18% of our common stock and approximately 50% of our Series A preferred stock. Various trusts related to his mother Dorothy Byrne are the beneficial owners of an additional aggregate of approximately 5.0% of our common stock. In addition, according to public filings with the SEC, at December 31, 2018, a small number of institutional investors were beneficial owners of significant percentages of our common stock. Sales by any of such stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the market prices of our common stock and/or preferred stock. Dr. Byrne and/or entities he controls, including High Plains Investments LLC, may sell shares of our common stock in the future and/or may enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan for the sale of shares of our common stock in the future. In addition, the transfer of ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares within a three-year period could adversely affect our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable net income. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the holders of our securities.\nPledges of our shares by officers and directors and significant stockholders could have an adverse effect on us and on the market price of our common and preferred stock.\nWe do not prohibit or restrict our officers, directors, significant stockholders or others from pledging shares of our company owned by any of them, by holding them in a margin account or otherwise. Patrick Byrne, who is our Chief Executive Officer, a member of our Board and our largest stockholder (directly and indirectly through High Plains Investments LLC), has pledged approximately 1.9 million of the approximately 5.8 million shares he beneficially owns to one or more banks to secure a credit facility for High Plains Investments LLC and a personal loan. Any margin call or similar action by a lender that results in a forced sale of shares pledged by any of our officers, directors or significant stockholders could have an adverse effect on us and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nOur quarterly operating results are volatile and may adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and preferred stock, and you may lose all or a part of your investment.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results in part because of seasonal fluctuations in traditional retail patterns. Our gross revenues have historically been significantly lower in the first and second calendar quarters than in the fourth quarter of the prior year due primarily to increased shopping activity during the fourth quarter holiday season. Further, we generally increase our inventories substantially in anticipation of holiday season shopping activity, which has a negative effect on our cash flow. As a result of the fourth quarter holiday season shopping, we also typically have unusually large payments due to our fulfillment partners in the first calendar quarter. Our revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition to seasonal effects and the other risk factors described in this report, factors that have caused and/or could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and in turn affect the market prices of our common stock and preferred stock include:\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of advertising and changes in our sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpenses we incur in our Medici and tZERO business development efforts;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our existing and future marketing campaigns are successful;\n\u2022\nprice competition, particularly in the costs of marketing as well as in product pricing;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our purchases of inventory;\n\u2022\nour inability to manage distribution operations or provide adequate levels of customer service;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of fuel, transportation or distribution;\n\u2022\nour inability to implement technology changes or integrate operations and technologies from acquisitions or other business combinations;\n\u2022\nour efforts to offer new lines of products and services; and\n\u2022\nour inability to attract users to our website.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business and our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on the holders of our common stock and of our preferred stock.\nOur outstanding preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances.\nWe have two series of preferred stock outstanding. The preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances. The preferred stock generally votes with the common stock, with holders of the preferred stock having one vote for each share held. As of December 31, 2018, the 481,259 outstanding shares of preferred stock constituted approximately 1.5% of the total number of shares of the preferred stock and the common stock, taken together. The preferred stock ranks senior to the common stock with respect to dividends, is entitled to an annual cash dividend of $0.16 per share in preference to any dividend on the common stock and is generally entitled to participate in any dividends we pay on the common stock. The preferred stock ranks equally with the common stock upon our liquidation, winding up or dissolution. Generally, in a business combination, each share of the preferred stock would be treated as a share of common stock. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the common stock.\nWe may issue additional preferred stock without further stockholder approval, for purposes of a stockholder rights plan or for other purposes, and any such preferred stock could entitle the holders to rights superior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board to designate and issue preferred stock on such terms as may be approved by the board without further stockholder approval. Our board could do so in connection with the adoption of a stockholder rights plan or for other reasons. Preferred stock could be issued with rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making an acquisition of our Company more difficult or costly. We currently have 1.0 million authorized shares of preferred stock undesignated as to series, and we could cause shares currently designated as to series but not outstanding to become undesignated and available for issuance as a series of preferred stock to be designated in the future.\nOur Board of Directors or the compensation committee could accelerate the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units upon a sale of the Company or otherwise, which could result in an increase in the number of shares outstanding.\nThe compensation committee of our board has granted and expects to grant additional restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to certain of our employees and directors. Upon vesting, we issue one share of common stock for every RSU held. The board or the compensation committee could determine to accelerate the vesting of RSUs in the event of our sale of our retail business or otherwise, which would result in an increase in the number of shares outstanding and would dilute stockholders' ownership of our company. Although the number of RSUs outstanding changes frequently, if all RSUs outstanding were vested as of December 31, 2018, the RSUs would convert into approximately 559,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 2.0% of the number of shares of common stock currently outstanding.\nWe generally have not received significant coverage by securities analysts, and the lack of coverage may adversely affect our share price and trading volume.\nWe generally have not received significant coverage by securities analysts, and the securities analysts who do cover us may stop coverage at any time. The lack of coverage may adversely affect our share price and trading volume and may cause our share price or trading volume to be lower than they might be if more analysts covered us.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding that our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nonly permitting the Board of Directors to fix the number of directors and to fill vacancies;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of Board of Directors and stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\ndesignating a state court located in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for specified matters.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15% or greater stockholder.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock or other securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock or other securities.\nAdditional Risks Related Primarily to our Series A Preferred Stock\nOur Series A Preferred shares are substantially different from other securities traded in the U.S. public markets and are subject to a variety of unusual restrictions and material risks.\nOur Series A Preferred can trade only on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the tZERO Platform. Trades of the Series A Preferred settle on the trade date. The Series A Preferred is not and will not be listed on any securities exchange or any other market of any kind. The Series A Preferred is extraordinarily illiquid. Only approximately ten trades in the Series A Preferred have taken place since we issued the Series A Preferred in December 2016. Shares of Series A Preferred can be held only in an online brokerage account with Keystone and cannot be held in any other account or manner. Only certain persons and types of entities may purchase Series A Preferred. As a result of these and other matters, the market for the Series A Preferred is likely to remain extraordinarily illiquid and it may be impossible to sell any shares of the Series A Preferred.\nThe technology on which the tZERO Platform depends has been developed by our majority-owned subsidiary, tZERO, and is licensed by its subsidiary, PRO Securities, and the Series A Preferred depends on both tZERO and on PRO Securities, neither of which has substantial resources.\ntZERO is a majority-owned subsidiary of ours and owns 100% of the equity interest in PRO Securities. tZERO licenses the tZERO Platform to PRO Securities, and PRO Securities operates the PRO Securities ATS. Neither tZERO nor PRO Securities has substantial resources or any commitment from any person, including the Company, to contribute additional capital or to make any loan to either of them. If any one or more of the Company, tZERO or PRO Securities were unable to fund its operations in the future, or if any one or more of them were to become the subject of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, PRO Securities might be unable to continue to operate the tZERO Platform, and the Series A Preferred could be materially adversely affected. In any such event, or if the PRO Securities ATS or the tZERO Platform were to be unable to operate as a result of intellectual property issues or fail to operate as intended for any other reason, holders of our capital stock, including the Series A Preferred, could lose their entire investment in our capital stock, including all amounts invested in the Series A Preferred.\nAccounts for the Series A Preferred are held directly in the customer's name, rather than in \"street name,\" and the complete trading history of each digital wallet is available to the general public and it may be possible for members of the public to determine the identity of the holders of wallets.\nThe Series A Preferred shares are directly recorded on our stockholder books and records maintained by Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (\"Computershare\"), and cannot be held in \"street name\". The tZERO Platform makes trade data publicly available shortly after each trade. The publicly available information includes the digital wallet address of each holder of Series A Preferred and the entire trading history of each wallet, including the price of each trade and the balance of the securities held. In addition, because all holders of the Series A Preferred are holders of record, all of them are subject to the risk of loss of their anonymity.\nThe Series A Preferred depends on both Keystone and its clearing broker, ETC.\nThe Series A Preferred depends on both Keystone and Electronic Transaction Clearing, Inc. (\"ETC\"). Keystone is the only broker dealer authorized to provide the accounts required to trade the Series A Preferred, and ETC is the clearing broker for Keystone with respect to the Series A Preferred. Any failure of either Keystone or ETC to continue operating or to satisfactorily perform its obligations could make it impossible to trade the Series A Preferred.\nIn the event of the insolvency of Keystone or ETC, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation might not provide any protection to the holders of Series A Preferred.\nThe Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\"SIPC\") oversees the liquidation of member broker dealers that close when the broker dealer is bankrupt or in financial trouble, and customer assets are missing. SIPC normally provides limited protection to customers. However, if Keystone or ETC were to become insolvent, the structure of the trading system for the Series A Preferred could mean that SIPC would provide no protection to holders at all, which could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred.\nTransactions involving the Series A Preferred could result in errors, which may be impossible to correct.\nSome transactions in the Series A Preferred could require manual intervention, which could result in errors, and because trades on in the Series A Preferred settle on the trade date, it may be impossible to correct any error, regardless of the source of the error, which could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred.\nThe Series A Preferred depends on Computershare as the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred.\nComputershare serves as the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred. If Computershare were unable or unwilling for any reason to serve as such, trading in the Series A Preferred would be impossible unless we were able to substitute another transfer agent, which would have a material adverse effect on the holders of the Series A Preferred.\nThe potential application of U.S. laws regarding traditional investment securities to the Series A Preferred is unclear.\nBecause of the differences between the Series A Preferred and traditional investment securities, there is a risk that issues that might easily be resolved by existing law if traditional securities were involved may not be easily resolved for the Series A Preferred. The occurrence of any such issue or dispute could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A Preferred.\nThe potential application of U.S. laws regarding virtual currencies and money transmission to PRO Securities' use of the Ethereum blockchain is unclear.\nThe tZERO Platform uses the Ethereum blockchain for certain purposes. None of the parties involved in the operation of the tZERO Platform is licensed under the virtual currency or money transmission regulations of any state in the United States or registered with FinCEN. If any regulatory authority were to assert that the operation of the tZERO Platform requires such licensing or registration, it could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the Series A Preferred.\nWe have the right to convert the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred into shares of Series B Preferred at any time.\nWe have the right to convert the Series A Preferred into Series B Preferred at any time, and the terms of the Series B Preferred may be amended at any time without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred. Any such conversion and any such amendment of the Series B Preferred could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred.\nThe restrictions on the tax reporting of holder's cost basis in shares of Series A Preferred will not allow normal tax planning in the sale of shares of Series A Preferred and may result in disadvantageous tax consequences to a seller of Series A Preferred.\nOnly one method of cost basis reporting (the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, method) is available for the Series A Preferred. As a result, sellers of Series A Preferred may be required to pay more tax on their sales or to pay taxes earlier than if other normal methods of cost basis reporting had been available, which could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A Preferred.\nAdditional Risks Related to both our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock\nWe do not intend to issue any additional shares of either Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred, which is expected to continue to result in very limited trading in each series.\nWe do not intend to issue any additional shares of Series A Preferred or of Series B Preferred, and we expect trading in the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred to continue to be very limited.\nWe do not expect there to be any market makers to develop a trading market in the Series A Preferred, and there is only one market maker in the Series B Preferred.\nMost securities that are publicly traded in the United States have one or more broker dealers acting as \"market makers\" for the security. A market maker is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell the security on a regular and continuous basis at publicly quoted prices. Currently, to our knowledge, there is only one market maker in the Series B Preferred. Further, we do not believe that the Series A Preferred will ever have any market makers. We expect the lack of market makers to continue to contribute to a lack of liquidity in the Series A Preferred and in the Series B Preferred, which could have a material adverse effect on holders' ability to trade either of them.\nRule 144 is not available for resales of \"restricted shares\" of Series A Preferred, and Rule 144 volume limitations on resales of Series B Preferred are very low.\nPersons, including non-affiliates of a public company such as the Company, who acquire shares directly or indirectly from the public company, or from an affiliate of the public company, in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offering, or otherwise as described in Rule 144, acquire \"restricted shares\" for purposes of Rule 144. Although Rule 144 permits public sales of \"restricted shares\" subject to certain conditions, Rule 144 is not available for any sales of Series A Preferred, and the sale of any such shares may be difficult or impossible. Further, because of the limited number of shares of Series B Preferred outstanding, the volume limitations of Rule 144 would severely limit sales of Series B Preferred under Rule 144.\nWe will have an economic incentive to repurchase Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred at prices below the redemption price, and our doing so could cause the trading prices of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred, as applicable, to decrease further.\nWe do not intend to repurchase any shares of the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred, but if we do, we would do so only at or below the prices at which we could redeem the shares. If we repurchase or redeem shares of either Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred, the trading market for the shares would become less liquid, which could cause the trading prices to decrease further, giving us an economic incentive to repurchase additional shares. The occurrence of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, or both.\nA share of Series A Preferred and/or Series B Preferred may have a substantially lower market value than a share of our common stock.\nThe trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred have been and may continue to be substantially lower than the trading price of our common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred and holders of Series B Preferred.\nHolders of Series A Preferred and/or Series B Preferred have no rights with respect to our common stock, but they may be adversely affected by certain events or changes made with respect to our common stock.\nHolders of our Series A Preferred and our Series B Preferred have no rights with respect to our common stock, and no right to convert their shares into common stock or to exchange their shares for common stock, except that such holders have the right to vote with the common stock. Holders of Preferred Stock do not have other rights of the holders of the common stock, including the right to respond to common stock tender offers, if any, and their investment in the Series A Preferred and/or the Series B Preferred may be materially negatively affected by any such event. Holders' lack of any such rights, or the occurrence of any such event, could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred and holders of Series B Preferred.\nVoting rights of holders of Preferred Stock generally will be limited to voting together with the holders of the common stock as a single class, and the holders of the Series A Preferred and the holders of the Series B Preferred collectively will have only a small percentage of the voting power on any matter submitted to the holders of the common stock and the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred, voting together as a single class.\nVoting rights of holders of Preferred Stock generally will be limited to voting together with the holders of the common stock as a single class. Neither the holders of the Series A Preferred nor the holders of the Series B Preferred have any right by themselves, either together or as separate classes, to elect any members of our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2018, the 481,259 shares of Preferred Stock that remained outstanding constituted approximately 1.5% of the total number of shares of the Preferred Stock and the common stock, taken together. If an amendment requiring stockholder approval is proposed to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the holders of the Series A Preferred and the holders of the Series B Preferred will vote together with the holders of the common stock as a single class, but neither the holders of the Series A Preferred nor the holders of the Series B Preferred will be entitled to a class vote on the amendment, unless the proposed amendment would adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred, respectively. Holders' limited voting rights and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred and holders of Series B.\nThe Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred rank junior to all of our and our subsidiaries' liabilities, as well as the capital stock of our subsidiaries held by third parties, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of our or our subsidiaries' business.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, any assets will be available to make payments to holders of Series A Preferred and to holders of Series B Preferred only after all of our liabilities have been paid, and neither the Series A Preferred nor the Series B Preferred will have any preference over the common stock in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up. In addition, the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred will rank structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries, as well as the capital stock of our subsidiaries held by third parties, including employees holding shares of our majority-owned subsidiary tZERO and employees holding shares of any other direct or indirect subsidiary of ours, whether now existing or created in the future. Any bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its wholly or partially owned subsidiaries would have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred and holders of Series B Preferred.\nOur obligation to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred or on the Series B Preferred is limited, and our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred and on the Series B Preferred may be limited.\nOur obligation to pay preferential dividends on the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred is subject to our Board of Directors declaring such dividend payments, and our failure to pay preferential dividends on the Series A Preferred and on the Series B Preferred might have no legal effect on us at all, although it could adversely affect the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and of the Series B Preferred. Further, our payment of any dividends will be subject to contractual and legal restrictions and other factors the board deems relevant, including agreements governing any future indebtedness of ours. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the Series A Preferred and the holders of the Series B Preferred.\nPurchasers of the Series A Preferred and of the Series B Preferred may be adversely affected by our issuance of any subsequent series of preferred stock.\nNeither the terms of the Series A Preferred nor the terms of the Series B Preferred restrict our ability to issue one or more additional new series of preferred stock, any or all of which may rank equally with or have preferences over the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred as to dividend payments, voting rights, rights upon liquidation or other types of rights. We will have no obligation to consider the specific interests of the holders of Series A Preferred or the specific interests of the holders of Series B Preferred in creating any such new series of preferred stock or engaging in any such offering or transaction. Our creation of any such new series of preferred stock or our engaging in any such offering or transaction could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A Preferred and the holders of Series B Preferred.\nIt is uncertain whether the IRS will treat the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred as common stock or preferred stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe intend to treat the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the IRS will treat the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were not to treat either the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred as\ncommon stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A Preferred and the holders of Series B Preferred.", "PERMNO": 89394, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "OSTK"}
