{"cik": "6951", "company": "APPLIED MATERIALS INC /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-12-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\u2019s operations and financial results.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied\u2019s customers, suppliers and partners globally. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures. Travel and logistics restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including working remotely, social distancing and other policies implemented in foreign and domestic sites, have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, transportation disruptions (such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures), production delays and capacity limitations at Applied and some of its customers, suppliers and partners, as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at Applied and customer sites, and additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce now working remotely full-time.\nWhile economic activity and business operations in certain regions continue to recover, there may be periods of significant or sudden increases in demand for Applied\u2019s products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products. Significant or sudden demand increases may result in a shortage of parts, materials or services needed to manufacture Applied\u2019s products or may cause shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints. Such shortages or delays could adversely impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to meet our demand requirements and our ability to meet our customer demand. There can be no assurance that Applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at current levels or at increased levels that may be necessary to address demand for Applied products. In addition, the pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have had, and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products, delayed deliveries or installation, cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs, and materially and adversely affect Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe degree to which the ongoing pandemic ultimately impacts Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the severity, duration and any resurgence of the pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the availability, public adoption and efficacy of COVID vaccines, effectiveness of government stimulus programs, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration of the global economic volatility that results from the ongoing pandemic. Additionally, Applied has a multi-phase plan to return to working on-site, which gradually allows additional workers to return onsite while practicing social distancing and other safety measures. However, there is no assurance that such plan and safety measures will be effective in preventing the inadvertent transmission of COVID-19 within the workplace. Further, implementation of such plan could adversely impact Applied\u2019s operations.\nRisks Associated with Operating a Global Business\nApplied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\nApplied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2021, approximately 91% of Applied\u2019s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied\u2019s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;\n\u2022political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n\u2022direct and indirect global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including the rules and interpretations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce expanding export license requirements for certain products sold to certain entities in China;\n\u2022customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;\n\u2022variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;\n\u2022ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;\n\u2022fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs;\n\u2022delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between and within countries;\n\u2022geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;\n\u2022failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;\n\u2022variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan or Korean won;\n\u2022the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;\n\u2022performance of third-party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;\n\u2022political instability, natural disasters, regional or global health epidemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;\n\u2022impacts of climate change on the operations of Applied, its customers and suppliers;\n\u2022challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;\n\u2022the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and\n\u2022uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.\nAs more fully discussed in the risk factor \u201cThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\u2019s operations and financial results\u201d above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied\u2019s customers, suppliers and partners globally.\nInternational trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could adversely impact our operations and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors.\nWe sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the United States including China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the United States and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions, and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFor example, certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and impact our business. The U.S. Department of Commerce has promulgated several rules and interpretations expanding export license requirements for U.S. companies that sell certain products to entities in China whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to China, and added certain Chinese companies, including one of the Company\u2019s customers, to its \u201centity list\u201d. These rules and interpretations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to such customer in China. Obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in China and adversely affect our results of operations. The implementation and interpretation of these rules are ongoing and their impact on our business is uncertain, and these rules and other regulatory changes that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. The U.S. and other governmental agencies may in the future promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to provide certain of its products to customers outside the U.S., including China.\nIn addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied\u2019s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of Applied\u2019s current business as well as long-term growth opportunities.\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.\nUncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, inflation and rising interest rates in various regions, could materially adversely impact Applied\u2019s operating results. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions that result in decreases in consumer spending and demand or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and transportation interruptions and other measures taken in response thereto, have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the global and regional economic activity, as well as our ability to meet our customer demand.\nSimilarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products (for example, as a result of the reopening of the economy with the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions) have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products. Such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers\u2019 ability to meet our demand requirements. In addition, Lunar New Year and other holidays in the countries in which we or our suppliers operate may reduce the level of business activities during such times, and thus adversely impact our and our suppliers\u2019 ability to manufacture and deliver products, supplies and services. Accelerated digital transformation may further increase consumer demand and exacerbate such shortages and also strain our manufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands and thus have an adverse impact on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied\u2019s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied\u2019s ability to compete effectively.\nUncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied\u2019s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.\nApplied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied\u2019s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate (including from impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied\u2019s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.\nRisks Associated with Applied\u2019s Industry\nThe industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.\nAs a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers\u2019 capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied\u2019s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on Applied\u2019s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on Applied\u2019s results of operations.\nTo meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied\u2019s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.\nApplied\u2019s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation. Applied\u2019s customer base is also geographically concentrated, particularly in China, Taiwan and Korea. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied\u2019s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied\u2019s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The geographic concentration of Applied\u2019s customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on Applied\u2019s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied\u2019s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or our inability to fulfill orders due to a shortage of parts, transportation interruptions or any other reason), Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied\u2019s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied\u2019s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied\u2019s business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins.\nApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.\nThe global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied\u2019s products and its consolidated results of operations, including:\n\u2022the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers\u2019 businesses and on demand for Applied\u2019s products;\n\u2022increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers\u2019 ability to raise the necessary capital;\n\u2022trade, regulatory, tax or government incentive policies impacting the timing of customers\u2019 investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;\n\u2022differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;\n\u2022the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;\n\u2022the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;\n\u2022the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;\n\u2022the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;\n\u2022manufacturers\u2019 ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;\n\u2022the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers\u2019 purchasing decisions;\n\u2022requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;\n\u2022price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;\n\u2022the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers\u2019 systems are available for production;\n\u2022increasing government incentives for local suppliers;\n\u2022the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and\n\u2022the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.\nApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.\nThe largest proportion of Applied\u2019s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:\n\u2022the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied\u2019s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;\n\u2022the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;\n\u2022the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;\n\u2022the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;\n\u2022the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;\n\u2022challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers\u2019 levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied\u2019s products have lower relative market presence;\n\u2022the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;\n\u2022semiconductor manufacturer\u2019s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us, and challenges in providing parts for reused equipment;\n\u2022shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;\n\u2022competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;\n\u2022consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;\n\u2022shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of Applied\u2019s foundry customers;\n\u2022the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied\u2019s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions;\n\u2022investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental regulations and policies in China and the United States;\n\u2022the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and\n\u2022the growing importance of specialty markets (such as Internet of Things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.\nIf Applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.\nThe global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied\u2019s display products and services, including:\n\u2022the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;\n\u2022the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied\u2019s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;\n\u2022the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in local economic conditions and governmental policies in China, Korea, Japan and the United States;\n\u2022the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;\n\u2022the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs, IT products and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied\u2019s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and\n\u2022fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.\nIf Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied\u2019s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.\nApplied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. To compete successfully, Applied must:\n\u2022identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;\n\u2022develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;\n\u2022differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers\u2019 performance specifications (including those related to energy consumption and environmental impact more broadly), appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;\n\u2022enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;\n\u2022focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers\u2019 high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;\n\u2022effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;\n\u2022improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;\n\u2022accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;\n\u2022improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;\n\u2022adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;\n\u2022qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and\n\u2022implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.\nIf Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Applied\u2019s Business, Finance and Operations\nSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied\u2019s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.\nApplied\u2019s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Significant and sudden increases in demand for Applied\u2019s products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture Applied\u2019s products. Such shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers\u2019 ability to meet our demand requirements. Difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts, materials or services, and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\u2019s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand.\nApplied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:\n\u2022the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022volatility in the availability and cost of parts, materials or services, including rising prices due to inflation;\n\u2022difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\n\u2022shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;\n\u2022a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general;\n\u2022information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and\n\u2022natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond Applied\u2019s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.\nAs more fully discussed in the risk factor \u201cThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\u2019s operations and financial results\u201d above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied\u2019s customers, suppliers and partners globally.\nIf a supplier fails to meet Applied\u2019s requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources. Transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may impair Applied\u2019s ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of its intellectual property rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of its customers\u2019 and other third parties. These outcomes could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject Applied to legal proceedings and claims. In addition, if Applied is unable to meet its customers\u2019 demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, its business, results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain Applied\u2019s manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact Applied\u2019s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied\u2019s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases or commits to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.\nApplied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:\n\u2022inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;\n\u2022the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;\n\u2022requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied\u2019s existing business or the acquired business;\n\u2022following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;\n\u2022failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;\n\u2022dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\u2022inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied\u2019s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;\n\u2022failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;\n\u2022potential changes in Applied\u2019s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s access to and cost of capital;\n\u2022reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;\n\u2022exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;\n\u2022challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;\n\u2022inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;\n\u2022inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company\u2019s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;\n\u2022impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;\n\u2022the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;\n\u2022unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and\n\u2022the inappropriate scale of acquired entities\u2019 critical resources or facilities for business needs.\nApplied also makes investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. Applied may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations. The risks to Applied\u2019s investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.\nApplied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan. Some divestitures may take the form of Applied contributing assets to a joint venture, and thus are subject to the joint venture risks discussed above. In addition, divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities (including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses) or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.\nAs part of its growth strategy, Applied seeks to expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied\u2019s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;\n\u2022the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;\n\u2022differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;\n\u2022Applied\u2019s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;\n\u2022the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;\n\u2022the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;\n\u2022the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;\n\u2022new materials, processes and technologies;\n\u2022the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;\n\u2022new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;\n\u2022new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;\n\u2022entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;\n\u2022third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.\nIn addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied is often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing, and/or other obligations.\nThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied\u2019s success.\nApplied\u2019s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied\u2019s organizational structure, increasing local and global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees in the local and global markets, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied\u2019s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact Applied\u2019s business and results of operations. The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.\nApplied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. There have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that, if enacted, would increase our tax liability. While it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. An increase in Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on Applied\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nConsistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied\u2019s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.\nIn addition, Applied is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied\u2019s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.\nApplied\u2019s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.\nApplied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of October 31, 2021, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied\u2019s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied\u2019s credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied\u2019s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied\u2019s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time.\nThe failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied\u2019s business and results of operations.\nApplied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied\u2019s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApplied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nApplied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied\u2019s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied\u2019s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied\u2019s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity\nApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nApplied\u2019s success depends in significant part on the protection of its technology using patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied\u2019s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Monitoring and detecting any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the protective measures it has implemented will completely prevent misuse. Applied\u2019s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, rendered obsolete or invalidated by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact Applied\u2019s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions, and diminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by Applied\u2019s intellectual property assets.\nThird parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied\u2019s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied\u2019s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied\u2019s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied\u2019s business and results of operations.\nApplied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.\nIn the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or its third-party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personal information of individuals. All information technology systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied and its third-party providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents, some of which may be successful. These cybersecurity incidents may range from employee error or misuse, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, known as advanced persistent threats, any of which may target the Company directly or indirectly through its third party providers and global supply chain. Although no such cybersecurity incident has been material to the Company to date, Applied continues to devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and it may be required to expend greater resources in the future, especially in the face of continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy and data protection laws. Depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents may result in business disruption, such as delay in the development and delivery of Applied\u2019s products or disruption of Applied\u2019s manufacturing processes; the misappropriation of intellectual property; corruption, loss of, or inability to access (e.g., through ransomware or denial of service) confidential information and critical data (i.e., that of Applied and its third party providers and customers); reputational damage; litigation or regulatory enforcement action related to contractual or regulatory privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or other confidentiality obligations; diminution in the value of Applied\u2019s investment in research, development and engineering; and increased costs associated with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to detect, deter, protect against, and recover from such incidents. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and data localization could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties. Further, customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality, and intellectual property, which may also increase our overall compliance burden.\nRisks Related to Legal and Compliance\nApplied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.\nApplied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and other intellectual property rights, trade, including import, export and customs, antitrust, environmental regulations, privacy, data protection, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification, product warranty or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.\nLegal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management\u2019s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied\u2019s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied\u2019s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.\nApplied is subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations and sustainability requirements.\nApplied is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, shipping and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations, including those relating to climate change, could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property.\nIn addition to regulatory compliance, growing customer sustainability requirements, as well as Applied\u2019s sustainability targets, could cause Applied from time to time to alter its manufacturing, operations or equipment designs, and incur substantial expense to meet these regulatory and sustainability requirements. Any failure to comply with these regulations, or meet these customer requirements or sustainability targets, could adversely impact the demand for Applied\u2019s products and subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks that could adversely affect Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApplied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.\nAs a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade (including import, export and customs), antitrust, environment, health and safety (including those relating to climate change), employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, data protection and localization, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied\u2019s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations, including, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, trade and import, antitrust, privacy, data protection, and anti-corruption, could result in fines, criminal penalties, restrictions on Applied\u2019s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14702, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "AMAT"}
