{"cik": "863015", "company": "ISLE OF CAPRI CASINOS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. We have described below what we currently believe to be the material risks and uncertainties in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. We also face other risks and uncertainties beyond what is described below. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly. You could lose all or part of your investment.\nWe face significant competition from other gaming operations, including Native American gaming facilities, and from legalization or expansion of gaming by states in or near where we own properties, that could have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nThe gaming industry is intensely competitive and we face a high degree of competition in the markets in which we operate. We have numerous competitors, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks, pari-mutuel operations or Native American-owned lands and video lottery and poker machines not located in casinos. We also compete with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online computer gambling, bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sports books, fantasy sports websites, \"cruise-to-nowhere\" operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai, and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. In addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers. We also face the risk that existing competitors will expand their operations and the risk that Native American gaming will continue to grow. For example, an existing competitor of our Bettendorf, Iowa property in Davenport opened its land-based gaming facility on June 16, 2016 replacing its previous riverboat casino. Some of our competitors may have better name recognition, marketing and financial resources than we do; competitors with more financial resources may therefore be able to improve the quality of, or expand, their gaming facilities in a way that we may be unable to match.\nIn addition, we also face the risk of further legalization and/or expansion of gaming. Certain states have recently legalized and other states are currently considering legalizing gaming. Our existing casinos attract a significant number of their customers from Houston, Texas; South Florida; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Denver, Colorado. Our continued success depends upon drawing customers from each of these geographic markets. In the past, legislation to legalize or expand gaming has been introduced that would impact some of these markets. For example, the Arkansas attorney general recently certified a proposed ballot initiative to amend the Arkansas Constitution to permit up to four gaming establishments. If the ballot initiative is successful, it could adversely affect our Lula property. Additionally, from time to time the State of Florida has entered into or amended gaming compacts with Native American Casinos or enacted, amended or discussed possible changes in gaming laws which could have positive or negative impacts on our Pompano operations. Recently the First District court of Appeals for the State of Florida ruled that a pari-mutuel operator in Gadsden County was entitled to a slot license from the Florida division of pari-mutuel wagering based on the court's interpretation of legislation passed in 2010. The court's ruling was challenged; however, if the ruling is upheld, it may apply to other counties in Florida and could lead to further expansion of gaming that could adversely affect our Pompano operation.\nWe expect similar proposals to legalize or expand gaming will be made in the future in various states, and it is uncertain whether such proposals will be successful. Further, because the economic recession has reduced the revenues of state governments from traditional tax sources, voters and state legislatures may be more sympathetic to proposals authorizing or expanding gaming in those jurisdictions.\nIn addition, there is no limit on the number of gaming licenses that may be granted in several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, new gaming licenses could be awarded in these jurisdictions, which could allow new gaming operators to enter our markets that could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us.\nLicensing requirements. As owners and operators of gaming and pari-mutuel wagering facilities, we are subject to extensive state and local regulation. State and local authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations, permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations. The regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate have very broad discretion with regard to their regulation of gaming operators, and may for a broad variety of reasons and in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries, or prevent other persons from owning an interest in us or doing business with us. We may also be deemed responsible for the acts and conduct of our employees. Substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations may be levied against us, our subsidiaries and the persons involved, and some regulatory authorities have the ability to require us to suspend our operations. The suspension or revocation of any of our licenses or our operations or the levy on us or our subsidiaries of a substantial fine would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTo date, we have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing gaming facilities. Nevertheless, we may not be able to retain these licenses, registrations, permits and approvals, or be able to obtain any new ones in order to expand our business, or on a timely basis. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. We may not be able to obtain such renewals or approvals.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions must approve, in advance, any restrictions on transfers of, agreements not to encumber or pledges of equity securities issued by a corporation that is registered as an intermediary company with such state, or that holds a gaming license. If these restrictions are not approved in advance, they will be invalid.\nCompliance with other laws. We are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations. However, several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years. As a consequence, it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that, as a result, environmental issues could\narise in the future, the precise nature of which we cannot now predict. The coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs.\nRegulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury Department require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. U.S. Treasury Department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with these regulations. The Financial Crime Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury has recently increased its focus on gaming companies.\nWe are required to report certain customer's gambling winning via form W-2G's to comply with current Internal Revenue Service regulations. Should these regulations change, we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements.\nIn May 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor released updated rules on overtime for salaried employees. Effective December 1, 2016, certain exempt salaried employees making below $47,476 annually may qualify for overtime. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised rules.\nSeveral of our riverboats must comply with U.S. Coast Guard requirements as to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety and must hold U.S. Coast Guard Certificates of Documentation and Inspection. The U.S. Coast Guard requirements also set limits on the operation of the riverboats and mandate licensing of certain personnel involved with the operation of the riverboats. Loss of a riverboat's Certificate of Documentation and Inspection could preclude its use as a riverboat casino. The U.S. Coast Guard shifted inspection duties related to permanently moored casino vessels to the individual states. Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri have elected to utilize the services of the American Bureau of Shipping to undertake the inspections. Iowa has elected to handle the inspections through the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The states continue the same inspection criteria as the U.S. Coast Guard in regard to annual and five year inspections. Depending on the outcome of these inspections a vessel could become subject to dry-docking for inspection of its hull, which could result in a temporary loss of service.\nWe are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity. Our casino barges and other facilities must also meet local fire safety standards. We would incur additional costs if any of our gaming facilities were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations.\nPotential changes in legislation and regulation of our operations. From time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, from time to time, certain anti-gaming groups have challenged constitutional amendments or legislation that would limit our ability to continue to operate in those jurisdictions in which these constitutional amendments or legislation have been adopted.\nTaxation and fees. State and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities. We believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, local and provincial income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Any\nmaterial increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties.\nOur operations in several jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties. If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted and, in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, Iowa law requires that each gambling venue in Iowa must have a licensed \"Qualified Sponsoring Organization,\" or QSO, which is a tax-exempt non-profit organization. The QSO must donate the profits it receives from casino operations to educational, civic, public, charitable, patriotic or religious uses. Each of our three Iowa properties has an agreement with a local QSO. We have the right to renew our agreements for Bettendorf and Waterloo when they expire in 2025 and 2018, respectively. In October 2015, we amended our agreement for Marquette which extended the expiration to June 2044.\nWe have a management agreement with Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, the owner of the gaming license issued by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board allowing operation of a casino at the resort. Under the terms of this agreement, we constructed and currently operate a casino at the resort. Our management agreement is subject to a buy-out provision on or after December 31, 2021, as well as other terms and conditions which could result in termination of the management agreement. The base term of the agreement is ten years, with four, five-year renewal options. Additionally, each party to the management agreement has certain termination rights. If the management agreement is terminated, we will no longer have the right to manage our casino at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort.\nOur business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking.\nLegislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. If additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in our jurisdictions, we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and particularly, if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and restrict our operations.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of April 24, 2016, we had approximately $923 million of total debt outstanding.\nOur significant indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, such as:\n\u2022 limiting our ability to use operating cash flow or obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion and other important areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022 causing an event of default if we fail to satisfy the financial and restrictive covenants contained in the indentures and agreements governing our senior secured credit facility, our 5.875% senior notes, our 8.875% senior subordinated notes and our other indebtedness, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable, could permit our secured lenders to foreclose on the assets securing our secured debt and have other adverse consequences, any of which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us;\n\u2022 if the indebtedness under our 5.875% senior notes, our 8.875% senior subordinated notes, our senior secured credit facility, or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness in full;\n\u2022 placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns or downturns in our business; and\n\u2022 our agreements governing our indebtedness, among other things, require us to maintain certain specified financial ratios and to meet certain financial tests. Our debt agreements also limit our ability to:\ni.borrow money;\nii.make capital expenditures;\niii.use assets as security in other transactions;\niv.make restricted payments or restricted investments;\nv.incur contingent obligations; and\nvi.sell assets and enter into leases and transactions with affiliates.\nA portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates. If short-term interest rates rise, our interest cost will increase our variable rate indebtedness, which will adversely affect our results of operations and available cash.\nAny of the factors listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow and future available draws under our senior secured credit facility may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our liquidity needs, including those needed to service our indebtedness.\nDespite our significant indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt. This could intensify the risks described above.\nThe terms of our senior secured credit facility, and the indentures governing our 5.875% senior notes, our 8.875% senior subordinated notes limit, but do not prohibit, us or our subsidiaries from incurring significant additional indebtedness in the future.\nAs of April 24, 2016, we have the capacity to incur additional indebtedness, including the ability to incur additional indebtedness under our line of credit, of approximately $224 million, after taking into account $8 million in letters of credit currently outstanding. If new debt is added to our current level of indebtedness, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur senior secured credit facility matures on April 19, 2018 and we may not be able to renew or extend it or enter into a new credit facility. In addition, our ability to renew or extend our senior secured credit facility or to enter into a new credit facility may be impaired if market conditions worsen. If we are able to renew or extend our senior secured credit facility, it may be on terms substantially less favorable than the senior secured credit facility.\nOur senior secured credit facility matures on April 19, 2018. Our ability to renew or extend our existing senior secured credit facility or to enter into a new credit facility to replace the existing senior secured credit facility could be impaired if market conditions worsen. In the current environment, lenders may seek more restrictive lending provisions and higher interest rates that may reduce our borrowing capacity and increase our costs. Failure to obtain sufficient financing or financing on acceptable terms would constrain our ability to operate our business and to continue our development\nand expansion projects. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully expand to new locations or recover our investment in capital projects or new properties which would adversely affect our operations and available resources.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring or managing other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing facilities. The expansion of our operations, whether through acquisitions, development, management contracts or internal growth, could divert management's attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting fees. To the extent that we elect to pursue any new gaming acquisition, management or development opportunity, our ability to benefit from our investment will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 our ability to successfully identify attractive acquisition and development opportunities;\n\u2022 our ability to successfully operate any developed, managed or acquired properties;\n\u2022 our ability to generate returns, if any, may take significantly longer than we expect;\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain competent management and employees for the new locations;\n\u2022 our ability to secure required federal, state and local licenses, permits and approvals, which in some jurisdictions are limited in number and subject to intense competition; and\n\u2022 the availability of adequate financing on acceptable terms.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Additionally, from time to time there are significant disruptions in the global capital markets that may adversely impact the ability of borrowers like us to access capital. Accordingly, we could be dependent on free cash flow from operations and remaining borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility to implement our near-term expansion plans and fund our planned capital expenditures. Moreover, lower-than-expected results from the opening of a new property may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition and may make it more difficult to raise capital. As a result of these and other considerations, we may not be able to successfully expand to additional locations or recover our investments in any new gaming development, management opportunities or acquired facilities.\nWe may experience construction delays or cost overruns during our expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations.\nFrom time to time, we may commence construction projects on new properties or at our current properties. For example, construction of a new $60 million land-based casino at our Bettendorf, Iowa property is nearly complete, with an expected opening date of June 24, 2016. We also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and we may in the future engage in additional construction projects. The anticipated costs and construction periods for our construction projects are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. Most of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. Significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security systems and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate.\nThe absence of sufficient electrical power, open data lines, or a failure of the technology services needed to run our systems may cause us to be unable to run all or parts of gaming operations. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from rolling blackouts, earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.\nSome of our casinos are located on leased property. If we default on one or more leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino.\nWe lease certain parcels of land on which several of our properties are located. As a ground lessee, we have the right to use the leased land; however, we do not hold fee ownership in the underlying land. Accordingly, with respect to the leased land, we will have no interest in the land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases. Moreover, since we do not completely control the land underlying the property, a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the long-term leases which are beyond our control. If the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. If we were to default on any one or more of these leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land, including the hotels and casinos. This would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities and may result in the default under our amended and restated credit facility.\nIf our key personnel leave us, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur continued success will depend, among other things, on the efforts and skills of a few key executive officers and the experience of our property managers. Our ability to retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any of these key individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain \"key man\" life insurance for any of our employees.\nWe are effectively controlled by members of the Goldstein family and their decisions may differ from those that may be made by other stockholders.\nRobert S. Goldstein, our Chairman of the Board, and Jeffrey D. Goldstein and Richard A. Goldstein, two of our directors, and various family trusts associated with members of the Goldstein family and entities associated with certain members of the Goldstein family, (collectively the \"Goldstein Parties\") directly and indirectly collectively own and control approximately 36.5% of our common stock as of April 24, 2016.\nThe Goldstein Parties have substantial control over the election of our board of directors and the outcome of the vote on substantially all other matters, including amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amendment of our by-laws and significant corporate transactions, such as the approval of a merger or other transactions involving a sale of the Company. Such substantial control may have the effect of discouraging transactions involving an actual or potential\nchange of control, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock. The interests of the Goldstein Parties may differ from those of our other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us, including:\n\u2022 we may not, until the Supermajority Expiration Time (as defined below) without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the Company's voting power, voting as a single class, authorize, adopt or approve certain extraordinary corporate transactions; and\n\u2022 the classification of our board of directors and staggered three-year terms of service for each class of directors.\n\"Supermajority Expiration Time\" means the first to occur of (i) the Goldstein Group ceasing to hold common stock of the Company representing at least 22.5% of our outstanding common stock, not including any shares of Class B common stock or shares of common stock issued upon conversion of any preferred stock and (ii) April 8, 2021. The \"Goldstein Group\" means Robert S. Goldstein, our Chairman, and Jeffrey D. Goldstein and Richard A. Goldstein, two of our directors, spouses, children and grandchildren of certain members of the Goldstein family and entities associated with certain members of the Goldstein family.\nThese provisions may make mergers, acquisitions, tender offers, the removal of management and certain other transactions more difficult or more costly and could discourage or limit stockholder participation in such types of transactions, whether or not such transactions are favored by the stockholders. The provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Further, the existence of these anti-takeover measures may cause potential bidders to look elsewhere, rather than initiating acquisition discussions with us. Any of these factors could reduce the price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulations that impose restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our securities.\nNo person may become the beneficial owner of five percent or more of any class or series of our capital stock unless such person agrees in writing to provide certain information to, and consent to a background investigation by, any applicable gaming authority. Our certificate of incorporation requires that, if in the judgment of our board of directors, a beneficial owner of our capital stock may result in the disapproval, modification, or non-renewal of any contract under which we have authority to manage any gaming operations or the loss or non-reinstatement of any license from any governmental agency to conduct any portion of our business, we may redeem such person's securities.\nIf we deem it necessary or advisable to redeem such securities, we will serve notice on the holder who holds securities subject to redemption and will call for the redemption of the securities of such holder at a redemption price equal to that required to be paid by the applicable gaming authority, or if such gaming authority does not require a certain price per share to be paid, a sum deemed reasonable by us, which in our discretion may be the original purchase price, the then current trading price of the securities or another price we determine. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not so required, as we elect. Unless the gaming authority requires otherwise, the redemption price will in no event exceed (i) the closing sale price of the securities on the national securities exchange on which such shares are then listed or (ii) if the shares are not then listed, then the mean between the representative bid and the ask price as quoted by any other generally recognized reporting system.\nFrom and after the date of redemption, such securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the person who was determined to be unsuitable, other than the right to receive the redemption price, will cease. Such person must surrender the certificates for any securities to be redeemed in accordance with the requirements of the redemption notice.\nOwnership and transfer of our securities could be subjected at any time to additional or more restrictive regulations, including regulation in applicable jurisdictions where there are no current restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our securities or in new jurisdictions where we may conduct our operations in the future. A detailed description of such regulations, including the requirements under gaming laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, can be found in the Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe have a history of fluctuations in our operating income (losses) from continuing operations, and we may incur additional operating losses from continuing operations in the future. Our operating results could fluctuate significantly on a periodic basis.\nAlthough we had income from continuing operations of $48.3 million in fiscal 2016 and $7.3 million in fiscal 2015, respectively, we sustained a (loss) from continuing operations of $(116.8) million in fiscal 2014. Companies with fluctuations in income (loss) from continuing operations often find it more challenging to raise capital to finance improvements in their businesses and to undertake other activities that return value to their stockholders. In addition, companies with operating results that fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis may experience increased volatility in their stock prices in addition to difficulties in raising capital. There may be fluctuations in our income (losses) from continuing operations in the future, and should that occur, we may suffer adverse consequences to our business as a result, which could decrease the value of our common stock.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nAs of April 24, 2016, we had $162.2 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. We perform annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist. For properties with goodwill and/or other intangible assets with indefinite lives, these tests could require the comparison of the implied fair value of each reporting unit to carrying value.\nWe must make various assumptions and estimates in performing our impairment testing. The implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition and by a market approach based upon valuation multiples for similar companies. Changes in estimates, increases in our cost of capital, reductions in transaction multiples, operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions, could produce significantly different results.\nWe also evaluate long-lived assets for impairment if indicators of impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of such property, equipment and other long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values.\nFuture cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. If our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met, we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. Our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory, social and economic climates, recent operating information and budgets, and current operating plans of the various properties where we conduct operations. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, internal operating decisions, or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties.\nInclement weather and other conditions could seriously disrupt our business and have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties. Because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with other casinos, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions and other disasters. For example, flooding along the Mississippi River resulted in five of our properties being closed for differing periods of time in fiscal 2012 and the harsh weather in the winter of fiscal 2014 affected regional gaming revenues. In addition, severe weather such as high winds and blizzards occasionally limits access to our land-based facilities in Colorado. The proceeds from any future insurance claim may not be sufficient to compensate us if one or more of our casinos experience a closure.\nWe have three properties that each generated more than 10% of our net revenues.\nIn fiscal 2016, our casinos in Pompano, Florida, Lake Charles, Louisiana and our Isle property in Black Hawk, Colorado, each generated more than 10% of our net revenues. Our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of these facilities. The operations at these facilities and any of our other facilities could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including those described in these \"Risk Factors\" as well as more specifically those described below:\n\u2022 risks related to local and regional economic and competitive conditions, such as a decline in the number of visitors to a facility, a downturn in the overall economy in the market, a decrease in consumer spending on gaming activities in the market or an increase in competition within and outside the state in which each property is located (for example, the effect on our Lake Charles property due to the new competitor which opened December 2014 and the effect on our Black Hawk properties due to a substantially renovated and expanded casino across the street);\n\u2022 changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations (including changes in laws and regulations affecting gaming operations and taxes) applicable to a facility;\n\u2022 impeded access to a facility due to weather, road construction or closures of primary access routes;\n\u2022 work stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems as well as issues arising in connection with agreements with horsemen and pari-mutuel clerks; and\n\u2022 the occurrence of natural disasters or other adverse regional weather trends.\nReductions in discretionary consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic fluctuations experienced in the United States, as we are highly dependent on discretionary spending by our patrons. Reductions in discretionary consumer spending or changes in consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased unemployment, significant increases in energy prices, perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions, housing market instability, instability in the financial markets, perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth, and changes in consumer confidence in the economy could reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and may adversely affect our revenues and operating cash flow. We are unable to predict the frequency, length or severity of economic circumstances.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically been volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors, including actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations, the announcement of significant transactions or other agreements by our competitors, conditions or trends in the industry or other entertainment industries with which we compete, general economic conditions including those affecting our customers' discretionary spending, changes in the cost of gasoline, changes in the gaming markets in which we operate and changes in the trading value of our common stock. The stock market in general, as well as stocks in the gaming sector have been subject to significant volatility and extreme price fluctuations that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to individual companies' operating performances. Broad market or industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nWork stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.\nSome of our employees at our Pompano, Florida location are currently represented by a labor union. Labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry. In addition, organized labor may benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration. We may experience additional or more successful union organizing activity in the future.\nAdditionally, lengthy strikes or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operations.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings which, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits and gaming regulatory proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. As with all litigation, the outcome of these matters is uncertain and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future.\nWe may suffer damage to our property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism), that could severely disrupt our business or subject us to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although we maintain insurance customary in our industry, (including property, casualty, terrorism and business interruption insurance) that insurance may not be adequate or available to cover all the risks to which our business and assets may be subject. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses if any damages occur, directly or indirectly, that could have a significant adverse impact on our operations.\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Among other factors, it is possible that regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe collect information relating to our guests and employees for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States. We rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit this personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information. Our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact, operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.\nIn addition, third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our guests, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information, guest, supplier, and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their consent.\nAny such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, guests' or business partners' information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have recently announced social gaming initiatives, which is a new line of business for us and a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market. We may not be able to compete effectively in this marketplace and our new initiatives may not be successful.\nWe have recently announced social gaming initiatives and expect to invest in and market social gaming and other mobile gaming platforms to our customers in casinos and beyond. Our products will compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors, including Caesars Interactive, Churchill Downs, Penn National Gaming and Zynga. Given the open nature of the development and distribution of games for electronic devices, our business will also compete with developers and distributors who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. We have limited experience operating in this rapidly evolving marketplace and may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, our ability to be successful with our social gaming platform is dependent on numerous factors beyond our control that affect the social and mobile gaming industry and the online gaming industry in the United States, including the occurrence and manner of legalization of online real money gaming in the United States beyond Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey; changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; changing laws and regulations affecting social and mobile games; the reaction of regulatory bodies to social gaming initiatives by holders of gaming licenses; the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment; any challenges to the intellectual property rights underlying our games; and outages and disruptions of our online services that may harm our business.\nOur social gaming initiatives will result in increased operating expense and increased time and attention from our management. Our social games will be complementary to our current operations and offer additional avenues of access and interaction for our customers. We do not expect our initial social gaming applications to be available for real money gaming, and we do not expect our social gaming initiatives to generate significant revenues in the near future.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us.\nThere are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry and a large majority of our revenues are derived from slot machines at our casinos. It is important, for competitive reasons, we offer the most popular and up-to-date slot machine games, with the latest technology to our customers.\nIn recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long-term than the cost to purchase a new slot machine.\nFor competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines, slot machine systems, or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participating lease costs, it could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.", "PERMNO": 77897, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "ISLE"}
