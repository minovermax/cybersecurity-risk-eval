{"cik": "803647", "company": "VERSAR INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of the Company by Kingswood\nThe announcement and pendency of the acquisition of the Company by Kingswood may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on our employees, suppliers, customers and other parties may have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties could impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to defer entering into contracts, or making other decisions, concerning doing business with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. The pursuit of the acquisition may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources towards the completion of the acquisition. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without the consent of Kingswood. These uncertainties and restrictions could disrupt or adversely affect our business and prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the acquisition or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThere may be unexpected delays in the completion of the acquisition, or the acquisition may not be completed at all.\nCertain events may delay the completion of the acquisition or result in a termination of the Merger Agreement. Some of these events are outside the control of either party. In particular, completion of the Offer requires the tender of a stated minimum percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock. We may incur significant additional costs in connection with any delay in completing the acquisition or the termination of the Merger Agreement, in addition to significant transaction costs, including legal, financial advisory, accounting and other costs we have already incurred.\nWe can neither assure you that the conditions to the completion of the acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that any adverse change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or state of facts that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement will not occur, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether or when the acquisition will be completed.\nFailure to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or at all could negatively affect our stock price and future business and financial results.\nDelays in completing the acquisition or the failure to complete the acquisition at all could negatively affect our future business and financial results, and, in that event, the market price of our common stock may decline significantly. If the acquisition is not completed for any reason, we will be subject to several risks, including the diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities while working to implement the acquisition, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our stock price. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the acquisition, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction. In addition, if we do not complete the acquisition, we may be required to pay a termination fee under certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transition costs in connection with the acquisition. We will be required to pay such costs relating to the transaction whether or not the acquisition is consummated.\nIf a sufficient number of shares are not tendered pursuant to the Offer, the merger may not be completed and our business could be impaired.\nIf the shares Kingswood acquires pursuant to the Offer together with any shares Kingswood otherwise owns in Versar equal at least a majority of Versar\u2019s issued and outstanding shares, the proposed merger can be effected without a shareholder vote under Delaware law. Therefore Kingswood will set a minimum tender condition to the consummation of the Offer and may terminate the Offer if the minimum tender condition is not met. If less than the required number of shares are tendered, then neither the Offer nor the merger may be completed, which could also cause significant uncertainty for Versar and its business could be severely and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur line of credit contains, and our future debt agreements may contain, covenants that may constrain our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest, including financing future operations or capital needs or engaging in other business activities, and that require us to maintain specific financial ratios or levels.\nOur line of credit constrains, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt;\n\u25cf\npay dividends or distributions on our capital stock;\n\u25cf\npurchase, redeem or retire capital stock;\n\u25cf\nmake acquisitions or other investments;\n\u25cf\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u25cf\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nmerge or consolidate with another company;\n\u25cf\nobtain or maintain the appropriate bonding necessary to perform our work; or\n\u25cf\ntransfer or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business.\nIn addition, our line of credit requires that we comply with certain consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) financial ratios and levels. These covenants may adversely impact our ability to finance our future operations or use the capital required to pursue available business opportunities.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and 2017, Versar was in default under certain financial covenants under our loan agreement. If in the future we again default under any future credit agreement, or if we are unable to obtain a new facility or refinance our existing indebtedness, it would have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operations.\nOn December 9, 2016, Versar, together with certain of its domestic subsidiaries acting as guarantors, entered into an amendment to its loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as lender. Under the amendment, the lender waived all existing events of default, and reduced the revolving facility to $13.0 million from $25.0 million. The amendment further amended the loan agreement to remove the consolidated Total Leverage Ratio covenant, consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio covenant, consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant, and the consolidated Asset Coverage Ratio covenant. Additionally, it added a covenant requiring Versar to maintain certain minimum quarterly consolidated EBITDA amounts and a requirement that we pursue one or more transactions to repay or replace Bank of America. Lastly, the amendment required Versar to repay or replace the existing facility by September 30, 2018. Subsequent to the amendment, Versar experienced additional covenant defaults. We have entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the Company pursuant to a tender offer and merger. If consummated, the proposed acquisition would result in the replacement of the loan agreement. If the transaction is not consummated, the Company must seek an alternative transaction to replace or refinance the loan agreement. Failure to refinance or replace the loan agreement would have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.\nWe are taking affirmative steps to modify operational plans and internal organization to ensure that we can continue to operate with our existing cash resources. The actual amount of funds that we will need will be determined by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated.\nThe accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared assuming Versar will continue as a going concern. If we are unable to identify alternative sources of funding and raise additional capital as needed to fund operations, due to our negative cash flow from operations and accumulated deficit, there would be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe are dependent on government contracts for the majority of our revenue, and a reduction or delay in spending by government agencies could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nContracts with agencies of the U.S. government and various state and local governments represented approximately 97% of our revenue in fiscal 2017, with the remaining 3% of our revenue coming from commercial sources. Therefore, the success of our business is materially dependent on contracts with governmental agencies. Companies engaged in government contracting are subject to certain unique business risks not shared by those serving the general commercial sector. Among these risks are:\n\u25cf\na competitive procurement process with no firm schedule or guarantee of contracts being awarded;\n\u25cf\npricing pressure that may require cost reductions in order to realize revenue under contracts;\n\u25cf\naward of work to competitors due primarily to policy reasons;\n\u25cf\ndependence on congressional and state appropriations and administrative allotment of funds;\n\u25cf\npolicies and regulations that can be readily changed by governing bodies;\n\u25cf\ncompeting political priorities and changes in the political climate regarding funding and operations of the services;\n\u25cf\nshifts in buying practices and policy changes regarding the use of contractors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in and delays or cancellations of government programs or requirements;\n\u25cf\ngovernment contracts that are usually awarded for relatively short periods of time and are subject to renewal options in favor of the government; and\n\u25cf\nmany contracts with U.S. government agencies require annual funding and may be terminated in the agency\u2019s sole discretion.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s contracting laws and regulations provide that the U.S. government can do business only with responsible contractors. Accordingly, U.S. government agencies have the authority under certain circumstances to suspend or debar a contractor from bidding on government contracts.\nA reduction or shift in spending priorities by U.S. government agencies could limit or eliminate the continued funding of our existing government contracts or awards of new contracts or new task orders under existing contracts. Any such reductions or shifts in spending, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInability of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government to agree on a budget for key agencies or to enact appropriations in a timely manner has in the past delayed, and may in the future delay, the award of contracts. These delays, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur government contracts are subject to audit and potential reduction of costs and fees.\nContracts with the U.S. government and many other state and local governmental agencies are subject to auditing by governmental agencies, which could result in the disallowance of certain costs and expenses. These audits can result in the disallowance of significant costs and expenses if the auditing agency determines, in its discretion, that certain costs and expenses were unwarranted, allowable, or were excessive. Disallowance of costs and expenses, if pervasive or significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations, violation of which could result in sanctions, contract termination, forfeiture of profit, harm to our reputation or loss of our status as an eligible government contractor.\nWe must comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the formation, administration and performance of government contracts. These laws and regulations govern how we transact business with our government clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs and related obligations on our business operations. Even though we take significant precautions to identify, prevent and deter fraud, misconduct and non-compliance, we face the risk that our personnel or outside partners may engage in misconduct, fraud or improper activities. Government contract violations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or sanctions, contract termination, forfeiture of profit and/or suspension of payment, any of which could make us lose our status as an eligible government contractor and could cause our reputation to suffer serious harm. Loss of our status as an eligible government contractor would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nActual or perceived conflicts of interest may prevent us from being able to bid on or perform contracts.\nU.S. government agencies have conflict of interest policies that may prevent us from bidding on or performing on certain contracts. When dealing with U.S. government agencies that have such policies, we must decide, at times with incomplete information, whether to participate in a particular business opportunity when doing so could preclude us from participating in a related procurement at a future date. We have, on occasion, declined to bid on certain projects because of actual or perceived conflicts of interest. We will continue to encounter such conflicts of interest in the future, which could cause us to be unable to secure key contracts with U.S. government agencies.\nRobust enforcement of environmental regulations is important to our financial success.\nOur business is materially dependent on the continued enforcement by federal, state and local governments of various environmental regulations. From time to time, depending on changing enforcement priorities, local, state and federal agencies modify environmental clean-up standards to promote economic growth and to discourage industrial businesses from relocating. Any relaxation in environmental and compliance standards could impact our ability to secure additional contracting work with such agencies or with other federal agencies that operate or manage contaminated property.\nMany of our U.S. government customers procure goods and services through IDIQ, government wide acquisition contract (GWAC) or General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule contracts under which we must compete for post-award orders.\nBudgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. government customers to purchase goods and services through IDIQ, GSA Schedule contracts and other multiple award and/or GWAC contract vehicles. These contract vehicles increase competition and pricing pressures, requiring us to make sustained efforts following the initial contract award to obtain ongoing awards and realize revenue. There can be no assurance that we will increase revenue or otherwise sell successfully under these contract vehicles. Any failure by Versar to compete effectively in this procurement environment could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, as well as our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nIf we fail to recover at-risk contract costs, we may have reduced fees or losses.\nWe are at risk for any costs incurred before a contract is executed, modified or renewed. A customer may choose not to pay us for these costs. While such costs are typically associated with specific anticipated contracts and funding modifications, we cannot be certain that our customers will execute these contracts or contract renewals, or that they will pay us for all our related at-risk costs. If any such unrecovered at-risk costs are significant, we may experience a decline in contract margins or experience losses on certain contracts or in certain periods, resulting in reduced profitability. We face increased pressure on profit margins and may need to lower margins to price projects at a more competitive rate to win awards.\nWe could face potential liability for failure to properly design or implement remediation efforts.\nPart of our business involves the design and implementation of remediation at environmental clean-up sites. If we fail to properly design, build, or implement a remediation system, or if a customer claims that we did, we could face expensive litigation or regulatory enforcement efforts and potential settlement costs. If we fail to successfully defend against such a lawsuit, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and our use of hazardous materials may subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as environmental laws and regulations in the various countries in which we operate. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of regulated substances and waste products, such as radioactive, biochemical or other hazardous materials and explosives. We may incur substantial costs in the future because of modifications to current laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, new guidance or new interpretation of existing laws or regulations, violations of environmental laws or required operating permits, or discovery of previously unknown contamination. Incurring such additional costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to properly manage projects may result in additional costs or claims.\nOur engagements regularly involve complex and lengthy projects. The quality of our performance on such projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage the relationship with our clients, and to effectively manage the projects and deploy appropriate resources in a timely manner. If we miscalculate the resources or time required to complete those projects with capped or fixed fees, our operating results could be adversely affected. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our client\u2019s expectations, could result in claims for damages against us.\nOur services expose us to significant risks of liability and it may be difficult to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage.\nOur services involve significant risks of professional and other liabilities that may exceed the fees we derive from performance. Our business activities could expose us to potential liability under various laws and regulations and under federal and state workplace health and safety regulations. In addition, we sometimes may assume liability by contract under indemnification agreements. Given the varied nature of our many agreements, we are not able to predict the magnitude of any such liabilities.\nWe obtain insurance from third party carriers to cover our potential risks and liabilities. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to meet our needs, may have to pay an excessive amount for the insurance coverage we require, or may not be able to acquire any insurance for certain types of business risks.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.\nA certain portion of our business is conducted internationally. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u25cf\nexport regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with the anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nthe burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations;\n\u25cf\npotential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u25cf\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nimport and export duties and value added taxes;\n\u25cf\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u25cf\nuncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and\n\u25cf\npotential military conflicts, civil strife and political risks.\nWhile we have and will continue to adopt and implement aggressive measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our foreign business, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate.\nPolitical destabilization or insurgency in the regions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain regions in which we operate are highly politically unstable. Insurgent activities in the areas in which we operate may cause further destabilization in these regions. There can be no assurance that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. We must significantly increase compensation to our personnel as an incentive to deploy them to many of these regions. To date, we have been able to recover such costs under our contracts, but we may not be able to do so in the future. To the extent that we are unable to transfer such increased costs to our customers, our operating margins would be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our operating performance. In addition, increased insurgent activities or destabilization, including civil unrest or a civil war in countries in which we operate, may lead to a determination by the U.S. government to halt our operations in a particular location, country or region and to perform the services that we provide using military personnel.\nIf our partners fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project, we could be exposed to legal liability, loss of reputation or reduced profits.\nFrom time to time, we enter into joint venture and other contractual arrangements with partners to jointly bid on and execute certain projects. The success of such joint projects depends in part on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations by our partners. If any of our partners fail to satisfy their contractual obligations, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to complete projects, increasing our cost on such projects. If we are unable to adequately address a partner\u2019s performance issues, then our client could terminate the joint project, exposing us to legal liability, loss of reputation or reduced profits.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries.\nThe markets for many of our services are highly competitive. There are numerous professional architectural, engineering, construction management, and environmental consulting firms, and other organizations that offer many of the same services we do. We compete with many companies that have greater resources than us and we cannot provide assurance that such competitors will not substantially increase the resources they devote to those businesses that compete directly with our services. Competitive factors considered by clients include reputation, performance, price, geographic location and availability of technically skilled personnel. In addition, we face competition from the use by our clients of in-house environmental, engineering and other staff.\nAn economic downturn may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn an economic recession, or under other adverse macroeconomic conditions that may arise from natural or man-made events, customers and vendors may be less likely to meet contractual terms and payment or delivery obligations. In particular, if the U.S. government changes its operational priorities in countries in which we operate, reduces the DOD Operations and Maintenance budget, or reduces funding for Department of State initiatives in which we participate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be severely affected.\nOur quarterly and annual revenue, expenses and operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues, expenses and operating results have and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe seasonality of the spending cycle of our public sector clients, notably the U.S. government, and the spending patterns of our private sector clients;\n\u25cf\nthe hiring and utilization rates of employees in the United States and internationally;\n\u25cf\nthe number and significance of client engagements commenced and completed during the period;\n\u25cf\nthe delays incurred in connection with an engagement because of weather or other factors;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to work within foreign countries\u2019 regulations, tax requirements and obligations;\n\u25cf\nthe business, financial, and security risks related to working in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalties;\n\u25cf\nthe size and scope of engagements;\n\u25cf\nthe delay in federal, state and local government procurements;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to perform contracts within budget or contractual limitations;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives;\n\u25cf\nany threatened or pending litigation or other regulatory enforcement matters;\n\u25cf\nperiodic reductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe likelihood of winning the re-bids of our existing large government contracts;\n\u25cf\nthe general economic and political conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of a major contract or the shutdown of a major program;\n\u25cf\nthe volatility of currencies in foreign countries; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to integrate any acquisition or the ability of an acquired business to continue to perform as expected.\nVariations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in net losses and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe are highly dependent on key personnel and our business could suffer if we cannot continue to attract, train and retain skilled employees.\nOur business is managed by a number of key management and operating professional personnel. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAvailability of highly trained and skilled professional, administrative and technical personnel is critical to our future growth and profitability. Even in the current economic climate, competition in our industry for scientists, engineers, technicians, management and professional personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees. Competition for experienced personnel, particularly in highly specialized areas, has occasionally made it more difficult for us to timely meet all our staffing needs. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract and retain required staff. Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to meet our financial obligations. Failure to recruit and retain a sufficient number of such employees could adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow our business. Some of our contracts require us to staff a program with personnel that the customer considers key to successful performance. If we cannot provide such personnel or acceptable substitutes, the customer may terminate the contract, and we may be unable to recover our costs.\nIn order to succeed, we will have to keep up with a variety of rapidly changing technologies. Various factors could affect our ability to keep pace with these changes.\nOur success will largely depend on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies that can occur rapidly in our core business segments. We may incur significant expenses updating our technologies, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations. Even if we keep up with the latest developments and available technology, newer services or technologies could negatively affect our business.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm our business.\nLike all companies, we face the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Employee misconduct could include intentional failures to comply with U.S. government procurement regulations, unauthorized activities, attempts to obtain reimbursement for improper expenses, or submission of falsified time records. Employee misconduct could also involve improper use of our customers\u2019 sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us. Negative press reports regarding employee misconduct could harm our reputation with the U.S. government agencies for which we work. If our reputation with these agencies is negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected. Despite an active compliance program, it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nInternal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenue, profitability and operating results.\nOur information technology systems are subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cyber intruders or hackers, computer viruses, attacks on our computers systems, phishing attacks, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Any such failures or cyber-threats could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business processes, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. Failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any system or service disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to bill our customers for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Versar has invested in and implemented systems that will allow it to achieve and remain in compliance with the regulations governing its business; however, there can be no assurance that such systems will be effective at achieving and maintaining compliance or that we will not incur additional costs in order to make such systems effective.\nWe have submitted claims to clients for work we performed beyond the initial scope of some of our contracts. If these clients do not approve these claims, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe typically have pending claims submitted under some of our contracts for payment of work performed beyond the initial contractual requirements for which we have already recorded revenue. In general, we cannot guarantee that such claims will be approved in whole, in part, or at all. If these claims are not approved, our revenue may be reduced in future periods.\nAn impairment charge of intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, intangible assets-net represent a substantial portion of our assets. Intangible assets, net, were $6.1 million as of June 30, 2017. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to test intangible assets carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach and whenever events occur that indicate impairment could exist. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, a significant sustained decline in our market capitalization and other factors.\nMaintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win certain fixed-price contracts. Failing to maintain adequate bonding capacity could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue new construction services contracts.\nIn line with industry practice, we are often required to provide bid, performance and/or payment bonds to clients under certain fixed-price contracts. These bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the relevant contract. If a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain such a bond, we cannot pursue that project. We have bonding capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety\u2019s sole discretion. Moreover, due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally, bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significantly higher costs. There can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new fixed-price contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating margins may decline under our fixed-price contracts if we fail to estimate accurately the time and resources necessary to satisfy our obligations.\nSome of our contracts are fixed-price contracts, under which we bear the risk of any cost overruns. Our profits are adversely affected if our costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions that we used in bidding for the contract. Often, we are required to fix the price for a contract before we finalize the project specifications, increasing the risk that we may misprice these contracts. The complexity of many of our engagements makes accurately estimating our time and resources more difficult. In the event we fail to estimate our time and resources accurately, our expenses will increase and our profitability, if any, under such contracts will decrease.", "PERMNO": 71191, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "VSRI"}
