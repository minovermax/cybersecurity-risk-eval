{"cik": "933036", "company": "RENT A CENTER INC DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. We believe these are all the material risks currently facing our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nOur success depends on the effective implementation and continued execution of our strategies.\nWe are focused on our mission to provide cash- and credit-constrained consumers with affordable and flexible access to durable goods that promote a higher quality of living. In 2019, we accelerated our virtual growth strategy through the acquisition of Merchants Preferred and launch of our Preferred Lease offering with a focus towards executing on large market opportunities through national and regional retail partners. We intend to capitalize on key differentiators in our Preferred Lease offering, as well as grow our business through expansion in our product verticals, e-commerce platform enhancements, and improving the customer experience.\nGrowth of our business model, including through the launch of new product offerings, requires us to invest in or expand our information and technology capabilities, engage and retain experienced management, and otherwise incur additional costs. Our inability to address these concerns or otherwise to achieve targeted results associated with our initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations, or negatively impact our ability to successfully execute future strategies, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nAs we pursue our strategies, we may take advantage of merger and acquisition opportunities from time to time that will advance our key initiatives; any such activities may not prove successful and may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may take advantage of merger and acquisition opportunities that will advance our key strategic initiatives. Such merger and acquisition opportunities involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, vendors and other business partners of the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022\nincreased amounts of debt incurred in connection with such activities or dilutive issuance of common stock.\nMergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control. We cannot assure you that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results.\nWe are highly dependent on the financial performance of our Rent-A-Center Business segment.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on our Rent-A-Center Business segment, which comprised approximately 67% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Any significant decrease in the financial performance of the Rent-A-Center Business segment may also have a material adverse impact on our ability to implement our growth strategies.\nA future lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nOur indebtedness currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, warrant. Our indebtedness was upgraded by Standard & Poor\u2019s in June 2019 and Moody's improved our outlook in July 2019. Any downgrade by any ratings agency may increase the interest rate on our future indebtedness, limit our access to vendor financing on favorable terms or otherwise result in higher borrowing costs, and likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing or recapitalize our existing debt structure.\nOur arrangements with our suppliers and vendors may be impacted by our financial results or financial position.\nSubstantially all of our merchandise suppliers and vendors sell to us on open account purchase terms. There is a risk that our key suppliers and vendors could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in, or any concern with, our financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of merchandise to us on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery or other assurances or credit support or by choosing not to sell merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all. Our arrangements with our suppliers and vendors may also\nbe impacted by media reports regarding our financial position or other factors relating to our business. Our need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and our supply of inventory could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of our key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.\nFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nCertain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. Consumer spending remains uncertain, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income in the Rent-A-Center Business segment. The competitive environment in our industry and increasing price transparency means that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever. As a result, we must continuously focus on managing our cost structure. Failure to manage our overall cost of operations, labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, other store expenses or indirect spending could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face additional risks in our retail partner business that differ in some potentially significant respects from the risks of the traditional rent-to-own business conducted in Rent-A-Center Business store locations. These risks could have a material negative effect on Preferred Lease, which could negatively impact our ability to grow the Preferred Lease segment and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur Preferred Lease segment offers the lease-to-own transaction through the stores or websites of third-party retailers. In addition to the risks associated with the integration of our historic retail partner business (Acceptance Now) with the Merchants Preferred business model under our Preferred Lease offering, the Preferred Lease segment faces risks different from those that have historically been associated with our traditional lease-to-own business conducted in our Rent-A-Center Business store locations. These potential risks include, among others:\n\u2022\nreliance on the ability of unaffiliated third-party retailers to attract customers and to maintain quality and consistency in their operations and their ability to continue to provide products and services;\n\u2022\nthe loss of the third-party retailer relationships and our inability to replace them. In 2019, approximately 69% of the total revenue of the Preferred Lease segment originated at our Preferred Lease kiosks located in stores operated by four retail partners.\n\u2022\nreliance on these unaffiliated third-party retailers for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications, including, for example, explaining the nature of the lease-to-own transaction to potential customers, and that the transaction is with Preferred Lease and not with the third-party retailer;\n\u2022\npotential that regulators may target the virtual lease-to-own transaction and/or adopt new regulations or legislation (or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in a manner) that negatively impact Preferred Lease\u2019s ability to offer virtual lease-to-own programs through third-party retail partners, and/or that regulators may attempt to force the application of laws and regulations on Preferred Lease\u2019s virtual lease-to-own business in inconsistent and unpredictable ways that could increase the compliance-related costs incurred by us, and negatively impact our financial and operational performance;\n\u2022\nreliance on automatic bank account drafts for lease payments, which may become disfavored as a payment method for these transactions by regulators and/or providers, or may otherwise become unavailable;\n\u2022\nmore product diversity within Preferred Lease's merchandise inventory relative to our traditional store-based lease-to-own business, which can complicate matters such as merchandise repair and disposition of merchandise that is returned:\n\u2022\nlower barriers to entry and start-up capital costs to launch a competitor due to the reliance of Preferred Lease and its competitors on the store locations and inventories of third-party retailers, and online connections with retailers, rather than incurring the cost to obtain and maintain brick and mortar locations and in-store or in-warehouse inventories; and\n\u2022\nindemnification obligations to Preferred Lease\u2019s retail partners and their service providers for losses stemming from Preferred Lease\u2019s failure to perform with respect to its products and services.\nThese risks could have a material negative effect on Preferred Lease, which could negatively impact our ability to grow the Preferred Lease segment and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur strategy to grow the retail partner business depends on our ability to develop and offer robust virtual lease-to-own technology, including algorithmic decisioning programs and waterfall integrations.\nOur retail partner business began as a staffed model and we believe our staffed lease-to-own kiosks inside third-party retailers are superior to virtual-only models in locations with sufficient volume. Our strategy to grow the retail partner business, though, depends on also offering an un-staffed or virtual lease-to-own solution, either alone or in combination with the staffed model (the hybrid model). The acquisition of Merchants Preferred\u2019s scalable technology offering, robust decision engine, enhanced\ninfrastructure and experienced management team in August 2019 accelerated the development of our virtual lease-to-own offering. We may not realize the strategic benefits we intended from the Merchants Preferred Acquisition and the software technology and decision programming may not work to our expectations or may fail. We are integrating the Preferred Lease and Merchants Preferred businesses and technologies under the Preferred Lease offering which may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected. In addition, our Preferred Lease business operates in a highly competitive environment.\nThe success of our business is dependent on factors affecting consumer spending that are not under our control.\nConsumer spending is affected by general economic conditions and other factors including levels of employment, disposable consumer income, prevailing interest rates, consumer debt and availability of credit, costs of fuel, inflation, recession and fears of recession, war and fears of war, pandemics, inclement weather, tariff policies, tax rates and rate increases, timing of receipt of tax refunds, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security. Unfavorable changes in factors affecting discretionary spending could reduce demand for our products and services resulting in lower revenue and negatively impacting the business and its financial results.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively with the growing e-commerce sector, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWith the continued expansion of Internet use, as well as mobile computing devices and smartphones, competition from the e-commerce sector continues to grow. To compete in this e-commerce sector, we must be able to innovate and develop technologies and digital solutions that appeal to our customer. We have launched virtual capabilities within our Preferred Lease and Rent-A-Center Business segments. There can be no assurance we will be successful in developing the technologies and digital solutions necessary to grow our e-commerce business in a profitable manner. Certain of our competitors, and a number of e-commerce retailers, have established e-commerce operations against which we compete for customers. It is possible that the increasing competition from the e-commerce sector may reduce ore prevent us from growing our market share, gross and operating margins, and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in other ways.\nDisruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business.\nAny disruption in our supply chain could result in our inability to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, higher costs, an inability to stock our stores, or longer lead time associated with distributing merchandise. Any such disruption within our supply chain network could also result in decreased net sales, increased costs and reduced profits.\nOur senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility limits our borrowing capacity to the value of certain of our assets. In addition, our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, and lenders may exercise remedies against the collateral in the event of our default.\nUnder our Asset Based Loan Credit Agreement entered into in August 2019 (the \"ABL Credit Agreement\"), we have access to a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Credit Facility\"). Our borrowing capacity under our ABL Credit Facility varies according to our eligible rental contracts, eligible installment sales accounts, and inventory net of certain reserves. In the event of any material decrease in the amount of or appraised value of these assets, our borrowing capacity would similarly decrease, which could adversely impact our business and liquidity. The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain restrictions on operations become applicable if our available credit falls below certain thresholds. These covenants could impose significant operating and financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to enter into particular transactions and to engage in other actions that we may believe are advisable or necessary for our business. Our obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are secured by liens with respect to inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts and certain related collateral. In the event of a default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods, the lenders\u2019 commitment to extend further credit under our ABL Credit Agreement could be terminated, our outstanding obligations could become immediately due and payable, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral, which generally consists of substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property and the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries. If we are unable to borrow under our ABL Credit Facility, we may not have the necessary cash resources for our operations and, if any event of default occurs, there is no assurance that we would have the cash resources available to repay such accelerated obligations, refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or cash collateralize our letters of credit, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our operations. Because we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle and group health insurance programs, unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial\nassumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including potential increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur transactions are regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal and state laws and regulations, which may require significant compliance costs and expose us to litigation. Any negative change in these laws or regulations or the passage of unfavorable new laws or regulations or the manner in which any of these are enforced could require us to alter our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to us.\nCurrently, 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have passed laws that regulate rental purchase transactions as separate and distinct from credit sales. One additional state has a retail installment sales statute that excludes leases, including lease-to-own transactions, from its coverage if the lease provides for more than a nominal purchase price at the end of the rental period. The specific rental purchase laws generally require certain contractual and advertising disclosures. They also provide varying levels of substantive consumer protection, such as requiring a grace period for late fees and contract reinstatement rights in the event the rental purchase agreement is terminated. The rental purchase laws of eleven states limit the total amount that may be charged over the life of a rental purchase agreement and the laws of six states limit the cash prices for which we may offer merchandise.\nSimilar to other consumer transactions, our rental purchase transaction is also governed by various federal and state consumer protection statutes. These consumer protection statutes, as well as the rental purchase statutes under which we operate, provide various consumer remedies, including monetary penalties, for violations. In our history, we have been the subject of litigation alleging that we have violated some of these statutory provisions.\nAlthough there is currently no comprehensive federal legislation regulating rental purchase transactions, adverse federal legislation may be enacted in the future. From time to time, both favorable and adverse legislation seeking to regulate our business has been introduced in Congress. In addition, various legislatures in the states where we currently do business may adopt new legislation or amend existing legislation that could require us to alter our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and operating results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nOur operations in the U.S. and abroad are subject to certain laws generally prohibiting companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. Violations by our employees, contractors or agents of policies and procedures we have implemented to ensure compliance with these laws could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits, could cause us to incur significant legal fees, and could damage our reputation.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings from time to time which seek material damages. The costs we incur in defending ourselves or associated with settling any of these proceedings, as well as a material final judgment or decree against us, could materially adversely affect our financial condition by requiring the payment of the settlement amount, a judgment or the posting of a bond.\nIn our history, we have defended class action lawsuits alleging various regulatory violations and have paid material amounts to settle such claims. Significant settlement amounts or final judgments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. The failure to pay any material judgment would be a default under our ABL Credit Agreement and our $200 million Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into in August 2019 (the \"Term Loan Credit Agreement\").\nTo attempt to limit costly and lengthy consumer, employee and other litigation, including class actions, we require our customers and employees to sign arbitration agreements, including class action waivers. In addition to opt-out provisions contained in such agreements, recent judicial and regulatory actions have attempted to restrict or eliminate the enforceability of such agreements and waivers. If we are not permitted to use arbitration agreements and/or class action waivers, or if the enforceability of such agreements and waivers is restricted or eliminated, we could incur increased costs to resolve legal actions brought by customers, employees and others, as we would be forced to participate in more expensive and lengthy dispute resolution processes.\nOur operations are dependent on effective information management systems. Failure of these systems could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize integrated information management systems. The efficient operation of our business is dependent on these systems to effectively manage our financial and operational data. The failure of our information management systems to perform as designed due to \u201cbugs,\u201d crashes, internet failures and outages, operator error, or catastrophic events, and any associated loss of data or interruption of such information management systems for a significant period of time could disrupt our business. If the information\nmanagement systems sustain repeated failures, we may not be able to manage our store operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe invest in new information management technology and systems and implement modifications and upgrades to existing systems. These investments include replacing legacy systems, making changes to existing systems, building redundancies, and acquiring new systems and hardware with updated functionality. We take actions and implement procedures designed to ensure the successful implementation of these investments, including the testing of new systems and the transfer of existing data, with minimal disruptions to the business. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, may cause disruptions to our existing systems and our business, and may not provide the anticipated benefits. A disruption in our information management systems, or our inability to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand our systems to meet our evolving business requirements, could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect the integrity and security of customer and employee information, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory enforcement and our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe collect and store certain personal information provided to us by our customers and employees in the ordinary course of our business. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, our systems continue to be subject to the risk of attack when computer hackers attempt to penetrate our network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or employee information. In addition, one of our employees, contractors or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or employee information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, employees, regulators and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security breaches, could adversely impact our business.\nA change in control could accelerate our obligation to pay our outstanding indebtedness, and we may not have sufficient liquid assets at that time to repay these amounts.\nUnder our ABL Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Credit Agreement, an event of default would result if a third party became the beneficial owner of 40.0% or more of our voting stock or certain changes in the composition of Rent-A-Center\u2019s Board of Directors during a twelve month period which were not recommended or approved by at least a majority of directors who were directors at the beginning of such twelve month period. As of December 31, 2019, we had a $239.5 million outstanding balance under our ABL Credit Facility and our Term Loan Credit Agreement, collectively.\nIf a specified change in control occurs and the lenders under our debt instruments accelerate these obligations, we may not have sufficient liquid assets to repay amounts outstanding under these agreements.\nRent-A-Center's organizational documents and our debt instruments contain provisions that may prevent or deter another group from paying a premium over the market price to Rent-A-Center's stockholders to acquire its stock.\nRent-A-Center\u2019s organizational documents contain provisions that classify its Board of Directors, authorize its Board of Directors to issue blank check preferred stock and establish advance notice requirements on its stockholders for director nominations and actions to be taken at meetings of the stockholders. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, Rent-A-Center is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to business combinations. Our ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement contain various change in control provisions which, in the event of a change in control, would cause a default under those provisions. These provisions and arrangements could delay, deter or prevent a merger, consolidation, tender offer or other business combination or change in control involving us that could include a premium over the market price of Rent-A-Center\u2019s common stock that some or a majority of Rent-A-Center\u2019s stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nRent-A-Center is a holding company and is dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries.\nRent-A-Center is a holding company, with no revenue generating operations and no assets other than its ownership interests in its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, Rent-A-Center is dependent on the cash flow generated by its direct and indirect operating subsidiaries and must rely on dividends or other intercompany transfers from its operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement. The ability of Rent-A-Center\u2019s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to it is subject to applicable state laws. Should one or more of Rent-A-Center\u2019s subsidiaries be unable to pay dividends or make distributions, Rent-A-Center's ability to meet its ongoing obligations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur stock price is volatile, and you may not be able to recover your investment if our stock price declines.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and can be expected to be significantly affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to meet market expectations with respect to the growth and profitability of each of our operating segments;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations, which may be impacted by, among other things, changes in same store sales, invoice volume or when and how many locations we acquire, open, sell or close;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nhow our actual financial performance compares to the financial performance guidance we provide;\n\u2022\nstate or federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are, or are perceived to be, adverse to our business;\n\u2022\nthe stock price performance of comparable companies; and\n\u2022\nthe unpredictability of global and regional economic and political conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market as a whole historically has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many specialty retailers in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance.\nThere can be no assurance as to the level of dividends that we may pay on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we initiated a cash dividend on our common stock in 2019, we are not required to declare or pay dividends and there may be circumstances under which we may be unable to declare and pay dividends under applicable Delaware law or might otherwise eliminate our common stock divided in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our brand and operating results could be harmed. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nWhile we continue to evaluate and improve our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.", "PERMNO": 81222, "SIC": 7350, "TIC": "RCII"}
