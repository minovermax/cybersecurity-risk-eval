{"cik": "1488075", "company": "IntraLinks Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nThe following risks and uncertainties, together with all other information in this Annual Report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, should be considered carefully. Any of the risk factors we describe below could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur future profitability is uncertain.\nWe have historically incurred significant net operating losses. As a result of these operating losses, we accumulated a deficit of $139.2 million from June 15, 2007, the date on which, through a series of transactions we refer to as the Merger, all of the outstanding equity of Intralinks, Inc. was acquired by a newly formed entity, TA Indigo Holding Corporation, which was owned by TA Associates, Inc. (now part of TA Associates Management, L.P.), Rho Capital Partners, Inc., a principal stockholder in Intralinks, Inc. since 2001, and other stockholders, including former and current officers and employees of Intralinks, Inc., through December 31, 2014. Our future profitability depends on, among other things, our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses. However, since our initial public offering in August 2010, we have incurred and will continue to incur as a public company significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses to which we were not subject to as a private company, including expenses related to our efforts in complying with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and other public company disclosure and corporate governance requirements, responding to requests of government regulators and defending the class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits filed against us. At the same time, we have significant and continuing fixed costs relating to the maintenance of our assets and business, including our substantial debt service requirements, which we may not be able to reduce adequately to sustain our profitability if our revenue decreases. Our profitability also may be impacted by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation charges and potential impairment of goodwill, which will negatively affect our reported financial results. Even if we achieve profitability on an annual basis, we may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly basis. You should not consider prior revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. In fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline. We may continue to incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. Our failure to achieve and maintain our profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to sustain positive cash flow.\nOur ability to continue to generate positive cash flow depends on our ability to generate collections from sales in excess of our cash expenditures. Our ability to generate and collect on sales can be negatively affected by many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour inability to convince new customers to use our services or existing customers to renew their contracts or use additional services;\n\u2022\nthe lengthening of our sales cycle;\n\u2022\nchanges in our customer mix;\n\u2022\na decision by any of our existing customers to cease or reduce using our services;\n\u2022\nfailure of customers to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022\na failure in the performance of our solutions or our internal controls that adversely affects our reputation or results in loss of business;\n\u2022\nthe loss of market share to existing or new competitors;\n\u2022\nregional or global economic conditions affecting perceived need for or value of our services; or\n\u2022\nour inability to develop new offerings, expand our offerings or drive adoption of our new offerings on a timely basis and thus our potentially not meeting evolving market needs.\nWe anticipate that we will incur increased sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as we continue to diversify our business into new industries and geographic markets. Our business will also require significant amounts of working capital to support our growth. In addition, we face significant expenditures in connection with our public company disclosure, Sarbanes-Oxley, and other corporate governance requirements, as well as the pending class action lawsuit. We may not achieve collections from sales to offset these anticipated expenditures sufficient to maintain positive future cash flow. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events that cause our costs to exceed our expectations. An inability to generate positive cash flow may decrease our long-term viability.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or future borrowings under our credit facilities or from other sources that may not be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, including capital expenditure requirements.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures and execute on our business plan. We may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus less able to withstand competitive pressures. Any of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment or debt repayment or to make improvements or respond to events that would enhance profitability. If we are unable to service or repay our debt when it becomes due, our lenders could seek to accelerate payment of all unpaid principal and foreclose on our assets, and we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity investments or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Additionally, we may not be able to take these types of actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which may have an impact on our stock price.\nOur operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. As a result, we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or operating results. Our operating results may fall below market analysts' expectations in some future quarters, which could lead to downturns in the market price of our common stock. Quarterly fluctuations may result from factors such as:\n\u2022\nchanges in the markets that we serve;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our services;\n\u2022\nrate of penetration within our existing customer base;\n\u2022\nloss of customers or business from one or more customers, including from consolidations and acquisitions of customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing of large contracts or contract terminations;\n\u2022\nincreased competition;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of customer types;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our offerings and sales channels through which they are sold;\n\u2022\nchanges in our standard service contracts that may affect when we recognize revenue;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our new product releases;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel;\n\u2022\ninterruption in our service resulting in a loss of revenue;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncosts of developing new solutions and enhancements;\n\u2022\nwrite-offs affecting any of our material assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating expenses;\n\u2022\ncustomer credits issued in excess of established reserves;\n\u2022\nsoftware \"bugs\" or other service quality problems;\n\u2022\nconcerns relating to the security of our systems;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\ngeneral domestic and international political, economic and market conditions.\nWe believe that our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future, that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations may not necessarily be meaningful and, as a result, such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in foreign currency transaction losses, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe currently have revenue and expenses and related assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may in the future have transactions denominated in the currencies of additional countries. Foreign currency transaction exposure results primarily from transactions with customers or vendors denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which we record the transaction. Any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies may positively or negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates due to the fact that we have non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated revenue and positively affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated expenses. If foreign currencies were to weaken or strengthen relative to the U.S. dollar, we might elect to raise or lower our international pricing, which could potentially impact demand for our services. Alternatively, we might opt not to adjust our international pricing as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could potentially have a positive or negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSimilarly, our financial performance may be impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates when it comes to our non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses. The third party vendors and suppliers to whom we owe payments for non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses may decide to increase or decrease their pricing to reflect fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Alternatively, these third parties may opt not to adjust their pricing as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIf there continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, we will continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results due to revaluing our assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity that recorded the asset or liability. Further, as foreign currency exchange rates change, the translation of our non-U.S. denominated revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars affects the year-over-year comparability of our operating results.\nFailure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and attract new business.\nMaintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions is an issue of critical importance for us and for our customers and users who rely on our systems to store and exchange large volumes of information, much of which is proprietary and confidential. There appears to be an increasing number of individuals, governments, groups and computer \"hackers\" developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs (such as viruses, worms and other malicious software) that could attack our computer systems or solutions or attempt to infiltrate our systems. We make significant efforts to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, solutions and source code. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers, it is virtually impossible for us to mitigate this risk entirely because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. Like all software solutions, our software is vulnerable to these types of attacks. An attack of this type could disrupt the proper functioning of our software solutions, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes. If an actual or perceived breach of our security were to occur, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our solutions and we could face lawsuits and potential liability, any of which could cause our financial performance to be negatively impacted. Though we maintain professional liability insurance that may be available to provide coverage if a cyber-security incident were to occur, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be available or that available coverage will be sufficient to cover losses and claims related to any cyber-security incidents we may experience.\nThere is also a danger of industrial espionage, cyber-attacks, misuse or theft of information or assets (including source code), or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities, systems or information, which could lead to the disclosure of portions of our source code or other confidential information, improper usage and distribution of our solutions\nwithout compensation, illegal or inappropriate usage of our systems and solutions, jeopardizing of the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems, manipulation and destruction of data, defects in our software and downtime issues. Although we actively employ measures to combat unlicensed copying, access and use of our facilities, systems, software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. The occurrence of an event of this nature could adversely affect our financial results or could result in significant claims against us for damages. Further, participating in either a lawsuit to protect against unauthorized access to, usage of or disclosure of any of our solutions or any portion of our source code or the prosecution of an individual in connection with a cybersecurity breach could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management's attention and adversely affect the market's perception of us and our solutions.\nA number of core processes, such as software development, sales and marketing, customer service and financial transactions, rely on our information technology, or IT, infrastructure and applications. Defects of malfunctions in our IT infrastructure and applications could cause our service offerings not to perform as our customers expect, which could harm our reputation and business. In addition, malicious software, sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types described above could cause an outage of our infrastructure, which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately downtimes, recovery costs and customer claims, any of which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial position, profit and cash flows.\nWe rely upon our customers and users of our solutions to perform important activities relating to the security of the data maintained on our Intralinks Platform, such as assignment of user access rights and administration of document access controls. Because we do not control the access provided by our customers to third parties with respect to the data on our systems, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of this data. Errors or wrongdoing by users resulting in security breaches could be attributed to us. Because many of our engagements involve business-critical projects for financial institutions and their customers and for other types of customers where confidentiality is of paramount importance, a failure or inability to meet our customers' expectations with respect to security and confidentiality could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and attract new business.\nThe confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems could also be jeopardized by a breach of our internal controls and policies by our employees, consultants or subcontractors having access to our systems. If our systems fail or are breached as a result of a third-party attack or an error, violation of internal controls or policies or a breach of contract by an employee, consultant or subcontractor that results in the unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information or customer data (including information about the existence and nature of the projects and transactions our customers are engaged in), we could lose business, suffer irreparable damage to our reputation and incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event. We could be liable for damages, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences, any of which liabilities could be significant. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot assure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us and divert management's attention from our operations. Any significant claim against us or litigation involving us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of our information, IT resources and other assets. Nonetheless, unauthorized users could gain access to our systems through cyber-attacks and steal, use without authorization and sabotage our intellectual property and confidential data. Any security breach, misuse of our IT systems or theft of our or our customers' intellectual property or data could lead to customer losses, non-renewal of customer agreements, loss of production, recovery costs or litigation brought by customers or business partners, any of which could adversely impact our cash flows and reputation and could have an adverse impact on our disclosure controls and procedures.\nOur ability to provide our services may be adversely impacted by disruptions to our hardware and software systems.\nOur services are highly dependent on our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems. Disruptions in our service and related software systems could be the result of errors or acts by our vendors, customers, users or other third parties, or electronic or physical attacks by persons seeking to disrupt our operations. Any damage to, or failure or capacity limitations of, our systems and our related network could result in interruptions in our service that could cause us to lose revenue, issue credits or refunds or could cause our customers to terminate their subscriptions for our services, in each case adversely affecting our renewal rates. Our business and reputation will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.\nIf we experience interruptions, delays or performance problems with the systems and applications that support our internal operations or difficulties replacing or implementing changes to those systems and applications, our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on various systems and applications to support our internal operations, including our billing, financial reporting and customer contracting functions. The availability of these systems and applications is essential to us and delays, disruptions or performance problems may adversely impact our ability to accurately bill our customers, report financial information and conduct our business. Additionally, we may choose to replace or implement changes to these systems, including substituting traditional systems with cloud-based solutions, which could be time-consuming and expensive and which could result in delays in the ongoing operational processes these software solutions support. Further, our cloud-based solutions may experience disruptions and outages that are beyond our control as we rely on third party vendors to support these solutions and assure their continued availability.\nWe may not successfully develop, introduce or integrate new services or enhancements to our Intralinks Platform or our application solutions and this could harm our reputation, revenues and operating income.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing Intralinks Platform, including our application solutions, and to introduce new functionality either by acquisition or internal development. Our operating results would suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our customers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not brought to market effectively. In addition, it is possible that our assumptions about the features that we believe will drive purchasing decisions for our potential customers or renewal decisions for our existing customers could be incorrect. In the past, we have experienced delays in the planned release dates of new features and upgrades and have discovered defects in new services after their introduction. There can be no assurance that new services or upgrades will be released on schedule or that, when released, they will not contain defects as a result of poor planning, execution or other factors during the product development lifecycle. In addition, we could experience challenges, delays or quality issues in our product development efforts due to the demands of the Agile development methodology we rely upon. If any of these situations were to arise, we could suffer adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of revenue, delay in market acceptance or claims by customers brought against us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, upgrades and enhancements to our Intralinks Platform may require substantial investment and there can be no assurance that our investments will prove to help us achieve or sustain a durable competitive advantage in products, services and processes. If customers do not widely adopt our solutions or new innovations to our solutions, we may not be able to justify the investments we have made. If we are unable to develop, license or acquire new solutions or enhancements to existing services on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if our new or enhanced solutions do not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nUndetected errors or failures found in our products and services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services that could seriously harm our business.\nOur products and services may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point in their lives, but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. We frequently release new versions of our products and different aspects of our platform are in various stages of development. Despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products and services until after commencement of commercial availability or use, resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, customer dissatisfaction and reductions in revenues and margins, any of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to liability claims may not be enforceable in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly in certain markets outside the United States.\nIf we fail to develop our brand cost-effectively, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the Intralinks brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. In addition, misaligned marketing strategy may hinder our ability to build necessary brand awareness and complete the sales cycle. Brand promotion and protection will also require protection and defense of our trademarks, service marks and trade dress, which may not be adequate to protect our investment in our brand or prevent competitors' use of similar brands. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in unsuccessful attempts to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer.\nOur business depends substantially on customers renewing and expanding their subscriptions for our services. Any decline in our customer renewals and expansions would harm our future operating results.\nWe enter into subscription agreements with certain of our customers that are generally one year in length. As a result, maintaining the renewal rate of our subscription agreements is critical to our future success. Some of our contracts with annual commitment terms contain automatic renewal clauses. However, our customer agreements typically include a provision permitting the customer to provide notification of non-renewal within 30 to 90 days prior to the end of the contract term. Repeat customers who do not have automatic renewal terms typically negotiate renewal terms at or prior to each annual termination date. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of the initial term of their agreements and some of our customers have elected not to do so. We cannot assure you that any of our customer agreements will be renewed. The loss of any customers that individually or collectively account for a significant amount of our revenues would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur renewal rates may decline due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and functionality of our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe availability, price, performance and functionality of competing products and services;\n\u2022\nour customers ceasing to use or anticipating a declining need for our services in their operations;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate to our customers the value of our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe relative ease and low cost of moving to a competing product or service;\n\u2022\nconsolidation in our customer base;\n\u2022\nthe effects of economic downturns and global economic conditions; or\n\u2022\nreductions in our customers' spending levels.\nIf our renewal rates are lower than anticipated or decline for any reason, or if customers renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decrease and our profitability and gross margin may be harmed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from contracts that provide for the use of our solutions for a fixed duration. Our inability to enter into new contracts as existing ones expire could negatively impact our overall financial performance.\nMany of our contracts with customers are entered into in connection with discrete one-time financial and strategic business transactions and projects such as mergers and acquisitions, or M&A, transactions. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, revenue generated from transactional contracts constituted a substantial portion of our total revenue. These transactional agreements typically have initial terms of six to twelve months depending on the type of transaction and related purpose of the Intralinks exchange. Accordingly, our business depends on our ability to replace these transactional agreements as they expire. Our inability to enter into new contracts with existing customers or find new customers to replace these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant part of our business is derived from the use of our application solutions in connection with financial and strategic business transactions. Economic trends that affect the volume of these transactions may negatively impact the demand for our services.\nA significant portion of our revenue depends on the purchase of our services by parties involved in financial and strategic business transactions such as M&A transactions, loan syndications and other debt capital markets, or DCM, transactions. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, revenue generated from the M&A and DCM principal markets constituted 56.3%, 59.4% and 62.2%, respectively, of our total revenue. The volume of these types of transactions drives demand for our services. Downturns in the global economy or in the economies of the geographies in which we do business, rising unemployment and reduced equity valuations all create risks that could harm our business. We are not able to predict the impact any potential worsening of macroeconomic conditions could also have on our results of operations. The level of activity in the financial services industry, including the financial transactions our services are used to support, is sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including interest rates, regulatory policies, general economic conditions, our customers' competitive environments, business trends, terrorism and political change. Unfavorable conditions or changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe typically provide service availability commitments under our customer agreements. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue and reputation.\nIn our customer agreements, we typically provide service level commitments. For some of our larger enterprise and government agency customers, we may provide custom service level commitments. If we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we were to suffer extended periods of unavailability of our solutions, we might be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits or refunds, or we could face contract terminations or non-renewals. Our revenue could be significantly affected if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our customer agreements. Any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, revenue and operating results.\nThe quality of our support and services offerings is important to our customers and, if we fail to offer high quality support and services, customers may not buy our solutions and our revenue may decline.\nOur customers generally depend on our service organization to resolve issues relating to the use of our solutions. A high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions. If we are unable to provide a level of support and service to meet or exceed the expectations of our customers, we could experience:\n\u2022\nloss of customers and market share;\n\u2022\na failure to attract new customers, including in new geographic regions; and\n\u2022\nincreased service and support costs and a diversion of resources.\nAny of the above results would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nThe sales cycle for enterprise customers can be long and unpredictable and requires considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nThe timing of our revenue from sales to enterprise customers is difficult to predict. Our enterprise sales efforts require us to educate our customers about the use and benefit of our services, including the technical capabilities and potential cost savings to an organization. In this market segment, in order to make sales, we may need to provide greater levels of customer education regarding the uses and benefits of our services, as well as regarding security, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations, especially for those customers in more heavily regulated industries or those with significant international operations. Enterprise customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process that has, in the past, resulted in a lengthy sales cycle, typically several months. We spend substantial time, effort and capital resources on our enterprise sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales.\nIn addition, larger enterprises may demand more customization, integration and support services and features. As a result, we may need to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to these sales opportunities, which could increase our costs, extend our sales cycle and divert our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger customers. Where we make sales to enterprise customers on a subscription basis, there is a delay between when we make the sale and when we start to recognize revenue from that customer. Further, where we provide professional services, we are required to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.\nIf sales expected from a specific customer for a particular period are not realized in that period or at all or we are required to delay realization of revenue related to a transaction to a later period, our financial results could fall short of public expectations and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements to which we are a party, including our customer agreements, potentially expose us to substantial liability for losses arising out of intellectual property infringement and other causes.\nCertain of our agreements with customers and partners include indemnification provisions under which we have agreed to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement related to our Intralinks Platform or application solutions and, in some cases, for damages caused by us to property or persons. If we were required to make large indemnity payments, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAllegations that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others, whether successful or not, may significantly increase our costs or adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.\nA third party may assert that our technology or services violates its intellectual property rights. In particular, as the number of products and services offered in our markets increase, as well as the number of related patents issued in the United States and elsewhere, and the functionality of these products and services further overlap, we believe that infringement claims may arise. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive and time-consuming to defend;\n\u2022\nforce us to stop providing services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign our technology and services;\n\u2022\ndivert management's attention and other company resources; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe face shareholder lawsuits and other potential liabilities that could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been, are currently and may in the future be the subject of various lawsuits, proceedings and investigations. Specifically, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit and we and certain of our current and former officers and directors were previously named as defendants in a series of stockholder derivative lawsuits. See Part I, Item 3 - \"Legal Proceedings\" for more information. Though these derivative lawsuits have been dismissed, given the stage of the class action lawsuit, we are unable to assess or quantify with any certainty the outcome, timing or potential costs of that matter. In defending and ultimately resolving the class action matter, we may be required to pay substantial amounts, divert management's attention from the operation of our business or change our business practices, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and, consequently, the trading price of our common stock.\nThe outcome and amount of resources needed to respond to, defend or resolve lawsuits or regulatory actions or requests is unpredictable and may remain unknown for long periods of time. Our exposure under these matters may also include our indemnification obligations, to the extent we have any, to current and former officers and directors and, in some cases former underwriters, against losses incurred in connection these matters, including reimbursement of legal fees and other expenses. Although we maintain insurance for claims of this nature, our insurance coverage does not apply in all circumstances and may be denied or insufficient to cover the costs related to the class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits. In addition, these matters or future lawsuits or investigations involving us may increase our insurance premiums, deductibles or co-insurance requirements or otherwise make it more difficult for us to maintain or obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, adverse publicity associated with regulatory actions and investigations and negative developments in pending legal proceedings could decrease customer demand for our services. As a result, the pending lawsuits and any future lawsuits or investigations involving us or our officers or directors could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and the trading price of our common stock.\nEvolutions in technology and related privacy concerns could result in regulatory changes and impose additional costs and liabilities on us, adversely affecting our business.\nOur application solutions provide our customers with central locations where they can post information and make it accessible to any parties they authorize. In connection with offering our solutions to our customers and their invited guests, we collect user information related to the individuals who access our software solutions. If we were required to change our business activities or revise or eliminate the services we offer, or if we were required to implement burdensome compliance measures, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not, may also inhibit market adoption of our solutions in some industries and foreign countries, harming our growth. In addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties and potential litigation if we fail to comply with applicable privacy regulations. The costs of compliance with privacy-related laws and regulations that apply to our customers\u2019 businesses may limit the adoption and use of our solutions and reduce overall demand for them. The European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations that may impact our ability to profitably operate in certain European countries. Further, the ongoing debate in the European Union around implementing a data privacy regulation causes uncertainty to our business, as we may have to implement new measures to comply with changing laws if and when they are adopted. Additional regulatory burdens of this sort could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce and of the international exchange of certain information is subject to possible unfavorable changes, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governments becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy. Further, laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers' ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our products and services. In addition, taxation of products and services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting the exchange of information over the Internet could result in reduced growth or a decline in the use of the Internet and could diminish the viability of our Internet-based services,\nwhich could harm our business and operating results.\nChanges in laws, regulations or governmental policy applicable to our customers or potential customers may decrease the demand for our solutions or increase our costs.\nThe level of our customers' and potential customers' activity in the business processes our services are used to support is sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including governmental regulation and regulatory policies. Many of our customers and potential customers in the life sciences, energy, utilities, insurance, financial and other industries are subject to substantial regulation and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. Accordingly, significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and could cause the demand for and sales of our solutions to decrease. For example, many products developed by our customers in the life sciences industry require approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other similar foreign regulatory agencies before they can market their products. The processes for filing and obtaining FDA approval to market these products are guided by specific protocols that our services help support, such as United States 21 CFR Part 11, which provides the criteria for acceptance by the FDA of electronic records. If new government regulations from future legislation or administrative action or from changes in FDA or foreign regulatory policies occur in the future, the services we currently provide may no longer support these life science processes and protocols, and we may lose customers in the life sciences industry. Any change in the scope of applicable regulations that either decreases the volume of transactions that our customers or potential customers enter into or otherwise negatively impacts their use of our solutions would have a material adverse effect on our revenues or gross margins. Moreover, complying with increased or changed regulations could cause our operating expenses to increase as we may have to reconfigure our existing services or develop new services to adapt to new regulatory rules and policies, either of which will require additional expense and time. Additionally, the information provided by, or residing in, the software or services we provide to our customers could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving our customers, which could result in requests for information from us that could be expensive and time consuming for us to address or harm our reputation since our customers rely on us to protect the confidentiality of their information. These types of changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to increase our penetration in our existing principal markets, develop, market and sell new solutions or expand into additional markets, we will be unable to grow our business and increase our revenue.\nWe currently market our solutions for a wide range of business processes. These include:\n\u2022\ndue diligence for M&A transactions;\n\u2022\npublic offerings and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nloan syndication and other debt capital markets transactions;\n\u2022\nboard reporting;\n\u2022\npartner document collaboration;\n\u2022\ndistribution of regulated content;\n\u2022\nsecure mobile access to content;\n\u2022\nclinical trial management;\n\u2022\nsafety information exchange and drug development and licensing for the life sciences industry;\n\u2022\nprivate equity fundraising, hedge fund marketing and investor reporting;\n\u2022\nenergy exploration and production ventures for the oil and gas industry;\n\u2022\ncontract and vendor management; and\n\u2022\nexternal content repositories.\nWe intend to continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts in these markets to grow our business. In addition, we believe our future growth depends not only on increasing our penetration into the principal markets in which our services are currently used, but also on identifying and expanding the number of industries, communities and markets that use or could use our services and expanding the solutions we offer to customers in those markets. Efforts to expand our service offerings beyond the markets that we currently serve or to develop, market and sell new service offerings, however, may divert management resources from existing operations, expose us to increased competition from new and existing competitors and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, any of which could significantly impair our operating results. Moreover, efforts to expand beyond our existing markets and solutions may never result in new services that achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable, particularly if a new target market turns out to be substantially less attractive than we envision due to overestimates in the number of potential customers, the speed at which the market will evolve or grow, the price potential customers are willing to pay for our solutions or the rate at which they are ready to adopt new products or approaches. Our inability to further penetrate our existing markets, successfully launch new solutions or identify additional markets and achieve acceptance of our services in these additional markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to retain our key executives, we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nWe rely on the expertise and experience of our senior management, especially our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald W. Hovsepian, as well as the other executive officers and key employees referenced in Item 10 of this Annual Report. Although we have employment agreements with our executive officers, none of them or any of our other management personnel is obligated to remain employed by us. We have no key-man insurance on any members of our management team. The loss of services of any key management personnel could lower productive output, interrupt our strategic vision and make it more difficult to pursue our business goals successfully. Furthermore, recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel are critical to our growth plans. We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among technology companies for experienced management personnel.\nOur employee retention and hiring may be adversely impacted by immigration restrictions and related factors.\nCompetition for skilled personnel is intense in our industry and any failure on our part to hire and retain appropriately skilled employees could harm our business. Our ability to hire and retain skilled employees is impacted, at least in part, by the fact that a portion of our professional workforce in the United States is comprised of foreign nationals who are not United States citizens. In order to be legally allowed to work for us, these individuals generally hold immigrant visas (which may or may not be tied to their employment with us) or green cards, the latter of which makes them permanent residents in the United States.\nThe ability of these foreign nationals to remain and work in the United States is impacted by a variety of laws and regulations, as well as the processing procedures of various government agencies. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or procedures could adversely affect our ability to hire or retain these skilled employees and could affect our costs of doing business and our ability to deliver services to our customers. In addition, if the laws, rules or procedures governing the ability of foreign nationals to work in the United States were to change or if the number of visas available for foreign nationals permitted to work in the United States were to be reduced, our business could be adversely affected, if, for example, we were unable to hire or no longer able to retain a skilled worker who is a foreign national.\nEmploying foreign nationals may require significant time and expense and our foreign national employees may choose to leave after we have made this investment. While a foreign national who is working under an immigrant visa tied to his or her employment by us may be less likely to choose to leave our company than a similarly situated employee who is a United States national or a green card holder (as leaving our employ could mean also having to leave the United States), this may not always be the case. Additionally, many of our foreign national employees hold green cards, which means that they have greater flexibility to leave our company without facing the risk of also having to leave the United States.\nIf we are unable to maintain or expand our direct sales capabilities, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues. In addition, if we are unable to maintain or expand our product development capabilities, we may not be able to meet our product development goals.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel. We rely primarily on our direct sales force to sell our services. Our services and solutions require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers. We may not have the required processes, systems and discipline to execute on our sales and growth strategies. We must expand our sales efforts to generate increased revenue from new customers. Failure to hire or retain qualified sales personnel will preclude us from expanding our business and generating anticipated revenue. Competition for talented sales personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing sales personnel or attract, assimilate or retain enough highly qualified sales personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If any of our sales representatives or sales management personnel were to leave us and join one of our competitors, we may be unable to prevent those sales representatives from helping our competitors solicit business from our existing customers, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nIn our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for individuals with high levels of technical experience and expertise in designing and developing innovative solutions. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate technical qualifications. If we fail to attract new technical personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current technical personnel, we may not be able to meet our product development goals and our business could be severely harmed.\nIn addition, we believe that, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. We have experienced and may in the future experience a substantial decline in the trading price of our stock. Accordingly, if the price of our stock is subject to a lengthy period of continued decline or significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees could be materially impaired. In the past, our sales force has experienced high turnover rates. New hires require training and take time to achieve full productivity. If we experience high turnover in our sales force or our product development group in the future, we cannot be certain that new hires will become as productive as necessary to maintain or increase our revenue.\nOur performance and growth depend on our ability to generate customer referrals and to develop referenceable customer relationships that will enhance our sales and marketing efforts.\nWe depend on end-users of our solutions to generate customer referrals for our services. We depend in part on the financial institutions, legal providers and other third parties who use our services to recommend them to a larger customer base than we can reach through our direct sales and internal marketing efforts. For instance, a significant portion of our revenue from our M&A business is derived from referrals by investment banks, financial advisors and law firms that have utilized our services in connection with prior transactions. These referrals are an important source of new customers for our services and generally are made without expectation of compensation. We intend to continue to focus our marketing efforts on these referral partners in order to expand our reach and improve the efficiency of our sales efforts.\nWe also recognize that having respected, well known, market-leading customers who have committed to deploy our solutions within their organizations will support our marketing and sales efforts, as these customers can act as references for us and our product offerings. Having these types of \u201creferenceable\u201d or \u201canchor\u201d customers is an important part of our growth strategy. Our ability to establish and maintain these customer relationships is important to our future profitability. The willingness of these types of customers to provide referrals or serve as anchor or reference customers depends on a number of factors, including the performance, ease of use, reliability, reputation and cost-effectiveness of our services as compared to those offered by our competitors, as well as the internal policies of these customers. We may not be able to cultivate or maintain the strong relationships with customers that are necessary to develop those customer relationships into referenceable accounts.\nThe loss of any of our significant referral sources, including our anchor customers, or a decline in the number of referrals we receive or anchor customers that we generate could require us to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our services, which would increase our costs, potentially lead to a decline in our revenue, slow our growth and generally have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the revenue we generate from our referral and anchor relationships may vary from period to period.\nWe rely in part on strategic relationships with third parties to sell and deliver our solutions. If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain these relationships, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition to generating customer referrals through third-party users of our solutions, we intend to pursue relationships with other third parties such as technology and content providers and implementation and distribution partners. Our future growth will depend, at least in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain successful strategic relationships with these third parties. Identifying partners and negotiating and documenting relationships with them requires significant time and resources, as does integrating third-party content and technology. Some of the third parties with whom we have strategic relationships have entered and may continue to enter into strategic relationships with our competitors. Further, these third parties may have multiple strategic relationships and may not regard us as significant for their businesses. As a result, they may choose to offer their services on terms that are unfavorable to us, terminate their respective relationships with us, pursue other partnerships or relationships, or attempt to develop or acquire services or solutions that compete with ours. Our relationships with strategic partners could also interfere with our ability to enter into desirable strategic relationships with other potential partners in the future. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining relationships with strategic partners on favorable economic terms, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased revenue or customer usage of our solutions or that the economic terms of these relationships will not adversely affect our margins.\nConsolidation in the commercial and investment banking industries and other industries we serve could adversely impact our business by eliminating a number of our existing and potential customers.\nThere has been, and continues to be, merger, acquisition and consolidation activity among our customers. Mergers or consolidations of banks and financial institutions, in particular, have reduced and may continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers for our solutions, resulting in a smaller market for our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the larger institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could perform themselves some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide in the future. A merger of two of our existing customers may also result in the merged entity deciding not to use our service or to purchase fewer of our services than the companies did separately or may result in the merged entity seeking pricing advantages or discounts using the leverage of its increased size. If that were to occur, it could adversely impact our revenue, which in turn would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, which could make it more difficult for us to acquire and retain customers.\nThe markets for online collaborative content workspaces and solutions for managing, distributing and protecting enterprise content are intensely competitive and rapidly changing, with relatively low barriers to entry. We expect competition to increase from existing competitors, as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as we expand our service offerings, we may face competition from new and existing competitors. It is also possible that our customers could decide to create, invest in or collaborate in the creation of competitive products that might limit or reduce their need for our products, services and solutions.\nWe compete primarily on product functionality, service levels, security and compliance characteristics, price and reputation. Our competitors include companies that provide online products that serve as document repositories, virtual data rooms or enterprise content file sharing and collaboration solutions, together with other products or services that may result in those companies effectively selling these services at lower prices and creating downward pricing pressure for us. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources than we do and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development and improvement of their services than we can. As a result, our competitors may be quicker at implementing technological changes and responding to customers' changing needs. In addition, if our competitors consolidate or our smaller competitors are acquired by other, larger competitors, they may be able to provide services comparable to ours at a lower price due to their size. Our competitors may also develop services or products that are superior to ours and their products or services may gain greater market acceptance than our services. The arrival of new market entrants could reduce the demand for our services or cause us to reduce our pricing, resulting in a loss of revenue and adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe average sales price of our solutions may decrease, which may reduce our profitability.\nThe average sales price for our solutions may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts we offer, new pricing models, a change in the mix of our solutions, anticipation of the introduction of new solutions or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market for online collaborative content workspaces and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. We cannot assure you that we will be successful maintaining our prices at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability. Failure to maintain our prices could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not maintain the compatibility of our services with third-party applications that our customers use in their business processes, demand for our services could decline.\nOur solutions can be used alongside a wide range of other systems such as email and enterprise software systems used by our customers in their businesses. If we do not support the continued integration of our services with third-party applications, including through the provision of application programming interfaces that enable data to be transferred readily between our services and third-party applications, demand for our services could decline and we could lose sales or experience declining renewal rates. We will also be required to make our services compatible with new or additional third-party applications that are introduced to the markets that we serve and, if we are not successful, we could experience reduced demand for our services. In addition, prospective customers, especially large enterprise customers, may require heavily customized features and functions unique to their business processes. If prospective customers require customized features or functions that we do not offer and that would be difficult for them to develop and integrate within our services, then the market for our services will be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or the marketplace, we could lose existing customers and fail to attract new business.\nWe may not be properly leveraging advances in technology to achieve or sustain a competitive advantage in products, services, information and processes. Our customers and users regularly adopt new technologies and industry standards continue to evolve. The introduction of products or services and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing services obsolete and unmarketable in short periods of time. We expect others to continue to develop, introduce new and enhance existing products and services, which will compete with our services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to enhance our current services and to develop and introduce new services that keep pace with technological developments, emerging industry standards\nand the needs of our customers. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in cost-effectively developing, marketing and selling new services or service enhancements that meet these changing demands on a timely basis, that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these services, or that our new service and service enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. We also cannot assure you that the features that we believe will drive purchasing decisions will in fact be the features that our potential customers consider most significant.\nIf the cloud-based enterprise software market develops more slowly than we expect or declines, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe cloud-based enterprise software market is not as mature as the market for on-premise enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether a cloud-based service like ours will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance. Because we derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue and cash flows from sales of our cloud-based enterprise software solutions, our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud computing for enterprises in general. Many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their organizations and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to a cloud-based model for storing, accessing, sharing and managing their content. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our services, the future growth rate and size of the cloud computing market or the entry of competitive services. The expansion of a cloud-based enterprise software market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with cloud computing, as well as the ability of companies that provide cloud-based services to address security and privacy concerns. If we or other providers of cloud-based services experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for cloud-based services as a whole, including our services, may be negatively affected. If cloud-based services do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for cloud-based services caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, we could experience decreased revenue, which could harm our growth rates and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur customers may adopt technologies that decrease the demand for our services, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business.\nWe target large institutions such as commercial banks, investment banks and life sciences companies for many of our services and we depend on their continued need for our services. However, over time, our customers or their advisors, such as law firms and investment banking firms, may acquire, adopt or develop their own technologies, such as client extranets, that decrease the need for our solutions. The use of these internal technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in pricing pressures or cause a reduction in our revenue. If we fail to manage these challenges adequately, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nInterruptions or delays in our service due to problems with our third-party web hosting facilities or other third-party service providers could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on SunGard Availability Services LP, or SunGard, for the maintenance of the equipment running our solutions and software at geographically dispersed hosting facilities. Our agreement with SunGard expires on December 31, 2015. Though we are reviewing our options at this time, if we are unable to renew, extend or replace this contract, we may be unable to arrange for replacement services at a similar cost and in a timely manner, which could cause an interruption in our service. We do not control the operation of these SunGard facilities, each of which may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures or similar events. These facilities may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism or similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, cessation of operations by our third-party web hosting provider or SunGard's decision to close a facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at any facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, the failure by these facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt that exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe had total indebtedness of $79.4 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014 pursuant to a Term Loan Credit Facility and $3.2 million in outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2014 pursuant to a Revolving Credit Facility. We refer to the Term Loan Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility collectively as the Credit Facilities. In February 2014, when we entered into the Credit Facilities, we refinanced all the outstanding indebtedness under our first lien credit facility entered into in June 2007, or the Prior Credit Facility. Each of our Credit Facilities is secured by liens on substantially all of our assets. Our Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first lien on our cash, accounts receivable and certain other liquid collateral and a second lien on our other assets. Our Term Loan Credit Facility is secured by a second lien on our cash, accounts receivable and certain other liquid collateral and a first lien on our other assets. The level and nature of our indebtedness could, among other thing:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business;\n\u2022\nreduce funds available for use in our operations and corporate development initiatives;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to incur additional debt because of financial and other restrictive covenants or the liens on our assets that secure our current debt;\n\u2022\nhinder our ability to raise equity capital, because in the event of a liquidation of our business, debt holders receive a priority before equity holders;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.\nWe have the ability to request the issuance of letters of credit under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility were primarily related to separate letters of credit provided to landlords under outstanding operating lease agreements for certain of the Company's office locations.\nIf we increase our indebtedness by borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility, cash collateralized facility or incur other new indebtedness, each of the risks described above would increase. In addition, we may incur significantly more debt in the future, which will increase each of the risks described above related to our indebtedness.\nOur loan agreements contain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOn February 24, 2014, we refinanced all of the outstanding indebtedness under our Prior Credit Facility with the proceeds of our new Term Loan Credit Facility and our new Revolving Credit Facility. The borrowings under our Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. Our loan agreements restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness other than in the normal course of business;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on and repurchase our stock; or\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with other entities.\nIn addition, our loan agreements have a change in control provision that provides that, upon the occurrence of a change in control, all credit facility commitments shall terminate and all loans shall become due and payable. Furthermore, our loan agreements require us to meet specified minimum financial measurements. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our loan agreements, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet those covenants. A breach of any of the covenants under either of these loan agreements could result in a default under both our loan agreements, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan agreements to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nWe might require additional capital to support the growth of our business and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings may increase our future borrowing costs, limit our ability to raise capital, cause our stock price to decline or reduce analyst coverage, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn the past, we have experienced a downgrade in one of our corporate credit ratings. Since investors, analysts and financial institutions often rely on credit ratings to assess a company's creditworthiness and risk profile, make investment decisions and establish threshold requirements for investment guidelines, our ability to raise capital, stock price and analyst coverage could be negatively impacted by a further downgrade to our credit rating.\nWe may choose to pursue business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management's attention.\nWe may support our growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses, services or technologies. Future acquisitions involve risks, such as:\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with integrating acquired technologies and operations of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nexposure to unforeseen liabilities;\n\u2022\ndiversion of managerial resources from day-to-day operations;\n\u2022\npossible loss of key employees, customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nmisjudgment with respect to the value, return on investment or strategic fit of any acquired operations or assets;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected transaction costs; and\n\u2022\nadditional dilution to our existing stockholders if we use our common stock as consideration for acquisitions.\nAs a result of these risks, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in completing or integrating acquisitions, we may be required to reevaluate our growth strategy.\nFuture business combinations could involve the acquisition of significant intangible assets. We may need to record write-downs from future impairments of identified intangible assets and goodwill. These accounting charges would reduce any future reported earnings or increase a reported loss. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash to pay the purchase price for acquisitions. Subject to the provisions of our existing indebtedness, it is possible that we could incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution.\nWe make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable or align with our established company vision.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth, including expenditures to develop new services or enhance our existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure, market and sell our product offerings and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including failures to align new initiatives, planning and execution with our established corporate vision and direction, which could lead to a misapplication of our resources. These new investments are inherently risky and may involve distracting management from current operations, create greater than expected liabilities and expenses, provide us with an inadequate return on capital, include other unidentified risks and, ultimately, may generally not be successful. Further, our ability to effectively integrate new services and investments into our business may affect our profitability. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue and financial performance.\nOur growth may strain our management, information systems and resources.\nOur growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to expand our overall business, customer base, headcount and operations both domestically and internationally. Growing a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems and procedures, and operational and financial controls, as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations. Our expected additional growth will increase our costs, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. If we fail to manage our growth successfully we will be unable to execute our business plan successfully, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to develop and implement appropriate operating practices, our performance may suffer in terms of quality, cost and cycle time.\nExpansion of our business internationally will subject us to additional economic and operational risks that could increase our costs and make it difficult for us to operate profitably.\nOne of our key growth strategies is to pursue international expansion. International revenue accounted for 39.0%, 41.3% and 42.8%, of our revenue in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. In addition, a further portion of our revenue is associated with\nemployees of United States customers using our services outside of the United States. The continued expansion of our international operations may require significant expenditure of financial and management resources and may result in increased administrative and compliance costs. In addition, international expansion will increasingly subject us to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nanti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and private actors, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others;\n\u2022\nlocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nthe effect of applicable foreign tax structures, including tax rates that may be higher than tax rates in the United States or taxes that may be duplicative of those imposed in the United States;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in each country, particularly in the European Union and Latin America, which continue to face significant economic challenges;\n\u2022\ninadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nincreased insurance and employee costs associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndependence on certain third parties, including channel partners with whom we may not have extensive experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential for political unrest, terrorism, hostilities or war; and\n\u2022\nthe difficulties in and increased expenses resulting from complying with a variety of foreign laws, regulations and trade standards, including employment, labor, tax, data protection and privacy laws that may or may not be in conflict with United States law.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nAs an international business providing secure content collaboration services around the world, we are subject to income taxes and non-income based taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. If our effective tax rate were to increase, our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nTo date, we have been audited in the United States with no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If future audits in the United States or other jurisdictions were to result in findings that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we were the subject of a tax audit or other inquiry, we would likely incur professional fees, which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn general, many governments and tax authorities are increasing their scrutiny of multi-national companies, which has contributed to an increase in audit activity and aggressive stances taken by tax authorities. In our case, French tax authorities recently commenced an inspection, based on a court order, of our business and operations to determine whether we are in compliance with our French tax obligations. It is our understanding that several multi-national technology companies have been involved in tax related audits or other inquiries in France. While we believe that we comply with French tax law, French tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes and may also assess penalties and interest against us. While considered unlikely at this time, any additional taxes or other assessments that we may be required to pay could be in excess of our current tax provisions or may require us to modify our business practices in order to reduce our exposure to additional taxes going forward, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we recognize revenue for our services ratably over the term of our customer agreements, downturns or upturns in the value of signed contracts will not be fully and immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe offer our services primarily through fixed commitment contracts and recognize revenue ratably over the related service period, which typically ranges from six to twelve months. As a result, some portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is revenue from contracts entered into during prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in signed contracts in any quarter will not be fully and immediately reflected in the revenue for that quarter, but will instead negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to offset this reduced revenue. Similarly, revenue attributable to an increase in contracts signed in a particular quarter will not be fully and immediately recognized, as revenue from new or renewed contracts is recognized ratably over the applicable service period. Because we incur sales commissions at the time of sale, we may not recognize revenues from some customers despite incurring considerable expense related to our sales processes. Timing differences of this nature could cause our margins and profitability to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOur offerings of new services or products may be subject to complex revenue recognition standards, which could materially affect our financial results.\nAs we introduce new services or products, revenue recognition could become increasingly complex and require additional analysis and judgment. Additionally, we may negotiate and revise terms and conditions of our contracts with customers and channel partners, which may also cause us to revise our revenue recognition policies. As our arrangements with customers evolve, we may be required to defer a greater portion of revenue into future periods, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported financial results.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and will occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be materially impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors' views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nUpon registration of our shares of common stock with the SEC, we became subject to rules and regulations that require us to maintain the effectiveness of both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. In addition, in 2011, we became subject to the requirement to perform an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and obtain a report from our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We reported a material weakness in 2011 and could report a material weakness in the future.\nIn May 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, issued an updated version of its Internal Control - Integrated Framework, or the 2013 Framework, which was originally issued in 1992 to help organizations design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. As of December 31, 2014, we completed our transition to the 2013 Framework. We expect the continuing requirements of the 2013 Framework to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and place a significant burden on our personnel, systems and resources. If our internal controls or disclosure controls are ineffective in future periods, our business and reputation could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are not able to maintain adequate compliance with these requirements in future years, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which could result in SEC or other regulatory investigations or proceedings, violations of New York Stock Exchange listing rules and loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, and, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nWe rely on third-party software and hardware to support our system and services and our business and reputation could suffer if these third-party services fail to perform properly or are no longer available to us.\nWe rely on hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties to offer our service. This hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services, which could negatively affect our business until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. In addition, it is possible that our hardware vendors or the licensors of third party software could increase the prices they charge, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, changing hardware vendors or software licensors could detract from management's ability to focus on the ongoing operations of our business or could cause delays in the operations of our business.\nAdditionally, third-party software underlying our services can contain undetected errors or bugs. We may be forced to delay commercial release of our services until any discovered problems are corrected and, in some cases, may need to implement enhancements or modifications to correct errors that we do not detect until after deployment of our services. In addition, problems with the third party software underlying our services could result in:\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nloss of or delayed revenue;\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nwarranty claims or litigation;\n\u2022\nloss of or delayed market acceptance of our services; and\n\u2022\nunexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors.\nOur use of \"open source\" software could negatively affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nA portion of the technologies licensed by us incorporates \"open source\" software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer any of our services that incorporate the open source software at no cost. Additionally, we may be required to make publicly available any source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and/or license those modifications or alterations on terms that are unfavorable to us. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from selling those of our services that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other rights, the value of our business and our competitive position may be impaired.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products and services similar to ours, which could decrease demand for our services. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures, to protect our intellectual property rights. These protections may not be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying or reverse-engineering our technology and services to create similar offerings. Additionally, any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of protection we seek, if at all. The scope of patent protection, if any, we may obtain from our patent applications is difficult to predict and our patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or of insufficient scope to prevent competitors from offering similar services. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors, subcontractors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and maintain policies and procedures to limit access to our trade secrets and proprietary information. These agreements and the other actions we take may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information from unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. Further, existing copyright and patent laws may not provide adequate or meaningful protection in the event competitors independently develop technology, products or services similar to ours. Even if the laws governing intellectual property rights provide protection, we may have insufficient resources to take the legal actions necessary to protect our interests. In addition, our intellectual property rights and interests may not be afforded the same protection under the laws of foreign countries as they are under the laws of the United States.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited or disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $40.9 million, including $13.4 million of windfall tax benefits attributable to equity compensation, to offset future taxable income, which expire in various years beginning in 2021 through 2030, if not utilized. If we were not to generate sufficient future taxable income, this would adversely affect our ability to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, under the Internal Revenue Code, substantial changes in our ownership could limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code impose limitations on a company's ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes if a company experiences a more-than-50-percent ownership change over a three-year period. We believe that, as a result of our initial and follow-on public offerings, or as a result of prior or future issuances of our capital stock, it is possible that such a change in our ownership could occur in the future. If such a change in our ownership occurs, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards in any future periods may be limited on an annual basis.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nSince our initial public offering, we have incurred and will continue to incur as a public company significant additional legal, accounting and other costs to which we were not subject to as a private company, including expenses related to our efforts in complying with Sarbanes-Oxley, and other public company disclosure and corporate governance requirements, responding to requests of government regulators and defending the class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits filed against us. Our management and other personnel will continue to need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. We expect that these rules, regulations and proceedings may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage previously available. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales could decrease.\nWe currently collect sales or use tax on our services in fourteen states. Historically, we have not charged or collected value added tax on our services anywhere in the world. We may lose sales or incur significant expenses should tax authorities in other jurisdictions where we do business be successful in imposing sales and use taxes, value added taxes or similar taxes on the services we provide. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, including interest and penalty charges, and could discourage customers from purchasing our services and otherwise harm our business. Further, we may conclude based on our own review that our services may be subject to sales and use taxes in other areas where we do business. Under these circumstances, we may voluntarily disclose our estimated liability to the respective tax authorities and initiate activities to collect taxes going forward.\nIt is not clear that our services are subject to sales and use tax in certain jurisdictions. States and certain municipalities in the United States, as well as countries outside the United States, have different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes. These rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time and, in the future, our services may be subject to such taxes. Although our customer contracts typically provide that our customers are responsible for the payment of all taxes associated with the provision and use of our services, customers may decline to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. In certain cases, we may elect not to request customers to pay back taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and associated interest and penalties, and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, or if we elect not to seek payment of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of our services to our customers, and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or gain new customers in jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.\nChanges in valuation allowance of deferred tax assets may affect our future operating results.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more-likely-than-not realizable. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent, feasible and practical tax planning strategies. On a regular basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability. To the extent we believe it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowance may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2014, we assessed that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize a portion of our deferred tax assets based on the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize a portion of deferred tax assets being valued. Accordingly and as more fully described in Note\n8 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2014, we recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.\nOur success depends on our customers' continued high-speed access to the Internet and the continued reliability of the Internet infrastructure.\nOur future sales growth depends on our customers having high-speed access to the Internet, as well as the continued maintenance and development of the Internet infrastructure. The future delivery of our services will depend on third-party Internet service providers to expand high-speed Internet access, maintain a reliable network with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, and develop complementary products and services, including high-speed modems, for providing reliable and timely Internet access and services. The success of our business depends directly on the continued accessibility, maintenance and improvement of the Internet as a convenient means of customer interaction, as well as an efficient medium for the delivery and distribution of information among businesses and by businesses to their employees. All of these factors are out of our control. If for any reason the Internet does not remain a widespread communications medium and commercial platform, the demand for our services would be significantly reduced, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent that the Internet continues to experience increased numbers of users, frequency of use or bandwidth requirements, the Internet may become congested and be unable to support the demands placed on it, and its performance or reliability may decline. Any future Internet outages or delays could adversely affect our ability to provide services to our customers, which could adversely affect our business.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nA natural disaster, telecommunications failure, power outage, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause us to suffer system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in product development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. An event of this nature could also prevent us from fulfilling customer orders or maintaining certain service level requirements, particularly in respect of our SaaS and hosted offerings. While we have developed certain disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe stock market, particularly in recent years, has experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to technology stocks. The volatility of technology stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies themselves. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions affecting our customers' businesses, including the level of activity in the M&A and syndicated loan markets;\n\u2022\nthe loss of any major customers or the acquisition of new customers for our services;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new services or functions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncomments by securities analysts, including the publication of their estimates of our operating results;\n\u2022\nactual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, including fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022\nrumors relating to us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to lawsuits and investigations involving us;\n\u2022\nactions of stockholders, including sales of shares by our directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning current or future strategic alliances or acquisitions.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, volatility in the market price of our stock could subject us to securities class action litigation. We are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits that could require us to incur substantial costs defending such lawsuits and divert the time and attention of our management.\nOur principal stockholders could exercise significant control over our company.\nAs of February 27, 2015, our two largest stockholders beneficially owned, in the aggregate, shares representing 27.7% of our outstanding capital stock. Although we are not aware of any voting arrangements in place among these stockholders, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, as a result of their stock ownership, they would likely be able to influence our management and affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. As of December 31, 2014, we had 57,084,340 shares of common stock outstanding. A relatively small number of our shareholders own large blocks of shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that public sales of these shares will have on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, shares subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. Moreover, as of February 27, 2015, entities affiliated with TA Associates, L.P. and Rho Capital Partners, Inc. held 15,849,337 shares of our common stock and have the right to require us to register these shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration rights agreement. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that these types of sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between these types of sales and the performance of our business.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our charter documents and our loan agreements could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for stockholders to change management.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and our loan agreements may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated by-laws;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and\n\u2022\nprovisions in our loan agreements that may accelerate payment of our debt in a change in control.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote, and not less than 75% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, is generally necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions that are contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our amended and restated by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock that our board of directors has not approved. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them.\nAs a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if\nany, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to pay dividends, and any future indebtedness that we may incur could preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our common stock if the price of our common stock increases.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. We have been, and may in the future be, the subject of unfavorable commentary or termination of coverage by equity analysts. The price of our common stock could decline as a result of any such negative commentary or termination of coverage.", "PERMNO": 12051, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "IL"}
