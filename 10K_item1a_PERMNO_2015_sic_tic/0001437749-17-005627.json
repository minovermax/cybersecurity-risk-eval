{"cik": "790715", "company": "SIGMA DESIGNS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our previously filed reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock may decline causing you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may occur in the course of our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nIf we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements in a timely manner, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively in our target markets and our ability to generate revenue will suffer.\nWe may not be able to accurately anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner. Our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\naccurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards;\n\u2022\naccurately design new chipset products;\n\u2022\ntimely complete and introduce new product designs;\n\u2022\ntimely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the equipment into which our products will be incorporated;\n\u2022\nensure that our subcontractors have sufficient foundry, assembly and testing capacity, packaging materials and acceptable manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\nshift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration; and\n\u2022\ngain market acceptance of our products and our customers\u2019 products.\nIf we fail to anticipate market requirements or develop new products or product enhancements in a cost-effective and timely manner, it may substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and may impact our ability to attract new customers or retain our existing customers, which would significantly harm our business and financial results.\nEven if we are able to anticipate, develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, our new products or enhancements may not achieve widespread market acceptance. Any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf demand for our chipsets declines or fails to increase, or if growth of the consumer electronics market does not continue, we will be unable to grow or sustain our net revenue.\nWe expect our chipsets to account for a substantial majority of our net revenue for the foreseeable future. For fiscal 2017, sales of our chipsets represented a substantial amount of our net revenue. Even if the consumer electronic markets that we target continue to expand, manufacturers of consumer products in these markets may not utilize our chipsets in their products. The markets for our products are characterized by frequent introduction of new technologies, short product life cycles and significant price competition. If we or our customers are unable to manage product transitions in a timely and cost effective manner, our net revenue may suffer. In addition, frequent technological changes and introduction of next generation products may result in inventory obsolescence which would increase our cost of revenue and adversely affect our operating performance. If demand for our chipsets declines or fails to grow or we are unable to develop new products to meet our customers\u2019 demand, our net revenue could be harmed.\nOur industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively in our target markets, which would harm our market share and cause our revenue to decline.\nThe markets in which we operate are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, continuously evolving customer requirements and declining average selling prices. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential market participants. Most of our products compete with large semiconductor providers that have substantial experience and expertise in video, audio, multimedia and IoT technology and in selling to consumer equipment providers. Many of these companies have substantially greater engineering, marketing and financial resources. As a result, other market participants may be able to respond more effectively to new or emerging technologies or standards and to changes in customer requirements. Further, some of our competitors are in a better financial and marketing position from which to influence industry acceptance competing technology than we are. Our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, and may be able to deliver similar products at a lower price. We also may face competition from newly established market participants, suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies and customers who choose to develop their own chipsets. Additionally, some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities or may have stronger manufacturing partner relationships than we have. We expect our current customers to seek additional suppliers of chipsets for inclusion in their products, which may impact our position in the industry and reduce our market share and net revenue.\nOur restructuring efforts may not be effective which could negatively impact our business.\nIn fiscal 2013, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, we launched and implemented restructuring plans to significantly reduce our operating expenses. Despite our efforts to structure our business to operate in a cost-effective manner, some cost reduction measures could have unexpected negative consequences, such as attrition among employees and a slowdown of development projects. While our restructuring efforts are intended to reduce our costs, we cannot be certain that all restructuring efforts will be successful, or that we will not be required to implement additional restructuring activities in the future. If we are unable to recognize the anticipated benefit from our restructuring plan, our results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we fail to achieve design wins for our products, we may be unable to recoup our investment in our products which may cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations.\nWe expend considerable resources in order to achieve design wins for our products, specifically new products and product enhancements. Once a customer designs a chip or chipset into a product, the customer is likely to continue to use the same chip or chipset or enhanced versions of that chip or chipset across a number of successor products for an extended timeframe. Failure to do so may result in significant costs and risks associated with qualifying a new supplier or redesigning the product to incorporate a different chip or chipset. As a result, if we do not achieve an initial design win in a customer\u2019s qualification process, we may lose the opportunity for significant sales to that same customer for a number of its current and future products. In some cases, even if we achieve a new design win, manufacturers may fail to purchase our products in sufficient volumes to recoup our development costs, or choose, at any time, to stop purchasing our products. This may cause our revenue and our results of operations to decline.\nOur growth strategy depends upon our ability to expand our product portfolio through external collaborations, which, if unsuccessful, may adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to continue to explore opportunities to enter into collaboration agreements and external alliances with other companies. As part of our ongoing efforts to remain competitive, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Telechips Inc., a semiconductor company based in South Korea. Failures by our collaborative partners to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us, or any disruption in the relationships between ourselves and these partners could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our collaborative relationships may give rise to disputes regarding each party\u2019s relative rights, obligations and revenues, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. These could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or other intellectual property protections, delay the development and sale of potential products, and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers and any reduction, delay or cancellation of an order from these customers or the loss of any of these customers could cause our revenue to decline.\nOur dependence on a limited number of customers means that the loss of a major customer or any reduction in orders by a major customer could materially reduce our net revenue and adversely affect our results of operations. We expect that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future. We have no firm, long-term volume commitments from any of our major customers and we generally accept purchase commitments from our customers based upon their purchase orders. Customer purchase orders may be cancelled and order volume levels can be changed, cancelled or delayed with limited or no penalties. We have experienced fluctuations in order levels from time to time and expect that we will continue to experience such fluctuations and cancellations in the future. We may also not be able to replace the cancelled, delayed or reduced purchase orders with new orders. Any difficulty in the collection of receivables from key customers could harm our business.\nOur business also depends on demand for our chipsets from large telecommunication carriers, who are not our direct customers but deploy IPTV set-top boxes that incorporate our chipsets. Large carriers often use multiple set-top box providers, who in turn sometimes use multiple contract manufacturers to purchase our chipsets and manufacture set-top boxes. Although we do not sell our products directly to these companies that ultimately deploy set-top boxes to consumers, these companies have a significant impact on the demand for our chipsets. For example, a significant number of our chipsets are incorporated in set-top boxes and gateways deployed by AT&T. In the past, companies that deploy set-top boxes incorporating our chipsets have had significant fluctuations in demand, which has resulted in a decline in our business from our direct customers. We may experience increased competition as companies that deploy set-top boxes incorporating our chipsets seek additional or alternate sources of supply of chipsets for inclusion in their products. Any decrease in the demand from companies that deploy IPTV set-top boxes incorporating our chipsets, in particular AT&T, could have a material and adverse effect on our net revenue and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the demand for our chipsets from large producers of consumer electronics within the television market, who are often not direct customers but deploy their televisions that incorporate our chipsets. Demand for our chipsets is determined by the number of design wins we are able to achieve within these producers\u2019 suites of product offerings. Even though we often do not sell our products directly to these large producers, they have a significant impact on the demand for our chipsets. For example, a significant number of our chipsets are incorporated in televisions deployed by Vizio and Roku. These companies that deploy televisions incorporating our chipsets may have significant fluctuations in demand, which could result in a decline in our business from our direct customers, such as OEMs and contract manufacturers. We may experience increased competition as companies that deploy televisions incorporating our chipsets seek additional or alternate sources of supply in their products. Any decrease in the demand from companies that deploy televisions incorporating our chipsets, in particular Vizio and Roku, could have a material and adverse effect on our net revenue and results of operations.\nOur inability to manage transitions to new solutions and products in an effective manner could reduce the demand for our solutions and products and the profitability of our operations.\nContinuing improvements in technology result in frequently updated solutions and new product introductions, short product life cycles, and improvements in product performance characteristics. If we cannot manage the transition to new solutions offerings and their respective products and services in an effective manner, customer demand for our solutions and products could diminish and our profitability could suffer. We are increasingly sourcing new products and transitioning existing products through our contract manufacturers and manufacturing outsourcing relationships in order to generate cost efficiencies, and deliver products faster to better serve our customers. Product transitions present execution challenges and risks, including the risk that new or upgraded products may have quality issues or other defects. The success of product transitions depends on a number of factors that include the availability of sufficient quantities of components at attractive costs and our ability to sell and manage inventory of older generation products. Failure to properly manage and oversee a product transition could have a material and adverse effect on our net revenue and results of operations.\nIf we fail to accurately assess product forecasts from our customers, our financial condition and liquidity could suffer.\nWe place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of our customers\u2019 demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into our estimates. When the demand for our customers\u2019 products increases significantly, we may not be able to meet demand on a timely basis and we may need to expend a significant amount of effort and time allocating a limited supply of product and maintaining positive customer relations. If we underestimate customer demand, we may forego revenue opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell. If one or more of our customers should experience insolvency or illiquidity and fail to obtain sufficient financing to sustain operations, the collectability of a portion of our accounts receivable, as well as the salability of any inventory we hold for that customer, could be impacted. While we seek to maintain adequate reserves for such risks, there can be no assurance that such reserves will always be adequate. For example, during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a provision for excess inventory of $2.0 million, $3.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively. When we have excess or obsolete inventory, the value of our inventory declines, which increases our cost of revenue and reduces our liquidity.\nWe have engaged, and may in the future engage in acquisitions of other businesses and technologies which could divert our attention and prove difficult to integrate with our existing business and technology.\nWe continue to consider investments in and acquisitions of other businesses, technologies or products as part of our efforts to improve our market position, broaden our technological capabilities and expand our product offerings. For example, in November 2015, in connection with our acquisition of Bretelon Inc., we added significant research and development operations and hired approximately 7 new employees. In the future, we may not be able to acquire or successfully identify companies, products or technologies that would enhance our business. Once we identify a strategic opportunity, the process to consummate a transaction could divert our attention from the operation of our business causing our financial results to decline.\nAcquisitions can require large one-time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional stock-based compensation expense, and the recording and subsequent amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations. We have and may also record goodwill in connection with an acquisition and incur goodwill impairment charges in the future. In addition, in order to complete acquisitions, we may issue equity securities and incur debt, which results in dilution of our shares and existing shareholders and could negatively impact profitability.\nWe may also encounter challenges in integrating acquired businesses. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and the diversion of management resources from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nunexpected costs or incurring unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nmanaging a larger combined company;\n\u2022\ndifficulties relating to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on the existing customer relationships of acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nadverse effects associated with entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe timing of our customer orders and product shipments can adversely affect our operating results and stock price.\nOur net revenue and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders received during a given period and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as net revenue during each period. Customers may change their cycle of product orders from us, which would affect the timing of our product shipments. Any failure or delay in the closing of orders expected to occur within a quarterly period, particularly from significant customers, would adversely affect our operating results. Further, to the extent we receive orders late in any given quarter, we may not be able to ship products to fill those orders during the same period in which we received the corresponding order which could have an adverse impact on our operating results for that period.\nIf we do not adequately enforce or protect our intellectual property, we may fail to prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary intellectual property - enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive and could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents.\nWe rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Preventing the unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult, expensive and time consuming. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken, or may take in the future, have prevented or will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property as fully or as readily as United States laws. Further, the laws in certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States.\nWe may need to litigate in the United States, China, or elsewhere in the world to enforce our contract and/or intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements and/or initiating litigation) and/or we could incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our operating results. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues in the period prior to conclusion.\nIf we fail to obtain intellectual property protection for our technology, our business could be adversely affected.\nPatent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. The success of our business depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot be certain that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that issued patents will not be challenged by our competitors or that the intellectual rights of third parties will not prevent us from selling our products in our target markets.\nClaims by third parties that our technology infringes their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.\nCertain third parties have asserted, and these or other third parties may assert, patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products or services were found to infringe on another company\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products or services, which could be costly, or to license such rights, pay damages or other compensation to such other company. If we are unable to redesign our products or services, license such intellectual property rights used in our products or services or otherwise distribute our products through a licensed supplier, we could be prohibited from making and selling such products or providing such services. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products or services sold or provided by us. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn may result in a decline in our chipset sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset revenues. Any claim, regardless of its merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur expectation is that we will continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies, including the United States International Trade Commission. Our involvement in certain litigation proceedings will cause us to defend against patent assertions related to our products by third parties, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is broad and may include, for example, monetary damages, royalty payments and/or an injunction on the sale of certain of our chipset products (and on the sale of our customers\u2019 devices using such products). A negative outcome in any of our existing proceedings or in future proceedings could result in significant costs to us, materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo remain competitive, we need to continue to transition our chipsets to increasingly smaller sizes while maintaining or increasing functionality, and our failure to do so may harm our business.\nWe periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to more advanced technology to reduce the size of our chipsets. The smaller chipset size reduces our production and packaging costs, which enables us to be competitive in our pricing. We also continually strive to increase the functionality of our chipsets, which is essential to competing effectively in our target markets. The transition to smaller geometries while maintaining or increasing functionality requires us to work with our contractors to modify the manufacturing processes, which results in the redesign of existing products. This effort requires considerable development investment and a risk of reduced yields as a new process is brought to acceptable levels of operating and quality efficiency. In the past, we have experienced difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies and new manufacturing processes, which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to a smaller geometry, all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and have a negative impact on our sales.\nThe average selling prices of semiconductor products have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross margins.\nThe semiconductor industry, in general, and the consumer electronics market that we target, specifically, are characterized by intense price competition, frequent introductions of new products and short product life cycles, which can result in rapid price erosion in the average selling prices for semiconductor products. A decline in the average selling prices of our products could harm our revenue and gross margins. The willingness of customers to design our chipsets into their products depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices. In the past, we have reduced our prices to meet customer requirements and to maintain a competitive advantage. Reductions in our average selling prices to one customer could impact our average selling prices to all customers. If we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product selling prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins in a timely manner, we may experience declines in our net revenue and gross margins.\nThe complexity of our products may result in unforeseen delays, expenses and in undetected defects, which could damage our reputation with customers, adversely affect the market acceptance of our new products and result in warranty claims.\nHighly complex products, such as those that we offer, frequently contain defects, particularly when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. Our chipsets contain highly sophisticated silicon technology and complex software. In the past we have experienced, and may in the future experience, defects in our products, both with our chipsets and the related software products we offer. If any of our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and our customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could harm our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, any of these factors could interrupt or delay sales or shipment of our products to our customers. Manufacturing defects may not be detected by the testing process performed by our subcontractors. If defects are discovered after we have shipped our products, it could result in unanticipated costs, order cancellations or deferrals and product returns or recalls, harm to our reputation and a decline in our net revenue, income from operations and gross margins.\nIn addition, our agreements with some customers contain warranty provisions which provide the customer with a right to damages if a defect is traced to our products or if we cannot correct errors in our product reported during the warranty period. Any contractual limitations to our liability may be unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction. Further, we do not have insurance coverage for any warranty or product liability claims and a successful claim could require us to pay substantial damages. Any such claim against us, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have adverse effects on our business results.\nIf our third-party manufacturers do not achieve satisfactory yields or quality, our relationships with our customers and our reputation may be harmed, which in turn would harm our operating results and financial performance.\nThe fabrication of our chips and chipsets is a complex and technically demanding process. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yields and, in some cases, cause production to be stopped or suspended. Although we work closely with our third-party manufacturers to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields, their facilities have, from time to time, experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields that have resulted in our inability to meet our customer demand. Many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct. Poor yields from wafer foundries, defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products may cause us to experience significant issues in customer relations or force us to sell our products at lower gross margins, therefore harming our financial results.\nRecent regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses which may negatively impact our financial results and decrease our cash balance.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC requires companies to disclose the use of certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d regardless of their actual country of origin) in their products. These requirements require companies to investigate, disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We have incurred additional expenses in our efforts to comply with these recent regulations; such expenses may become more significant in the future, which could negatively impact our financial results and decrease our cash balance. In response to this regulation, we evaluate our use of minerals and derivative metals on an annual basis, the most recent of which was filed with the SEC on the specialized disclosure report on Form SD on May 26, 2016 concluding that our supply chain is conflict free undeterminable. We believe we are in full compliance with the disclosure requirements as stated within the aforementioned regulation.\nAs there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals, we cannot be sure that our contract manufacturers and other suppliers will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. We are a fabless semiconductor company, and because of this our supply chain is complex. Some suppliers may choose not to share their confidential information related to their supply chain, which may cause us to face challenges with our customers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are \u201cconflict free.\u201d If this occurs, our customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may be required to write-off inventory in the event that it becomes unsalable as a result of these regulations.\nIf the growth of demand in the consumer electronics market does not continue, our ability to increase our revenue could suffer.\nOur business is highly dependent on developing sectors of the consumer electronics market, including the Connected Smart TV Platforms and IoT Devices markets. The consumer electronics market is highly competitive and is characterized by, among other things, frequent introductions of new products and short product life cycles. The consumer electronics market may also be negatively impacted by a slowdown in overall consumer spending. The worldwide economies, generally, and consumer spending, specifically, have exhibited significant volatility, which has negatively impacted our target markets. If our target markets do not grow as rapidly or to the extent we anticipate, our business could suffer. We expect the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future to come from the sale of our chipsets for use in emerging consumer applications. Our ability to sustain and increase revenue is in large part dependent on the continued growth of these rapidly evolving market sectors, whose future is largely uncertain. Many factors could impede or interfere with the expansion of these consumer market sectors, including consumer demand, general economic conditions, and other competing consumer electronic products, delays in the deployment of telecommunications video services and insufficient interest in new technology innovations. In addition, if market acceptance of the consumer products that utilize our products does not occur as expected, our business could be harmed.\nDue to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards and, from time to time, has experienced significant downturns. These downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand, excess customer inventory and accelerated erosion of prices. These factors have caused, and could cause, substantial fluctuations in our net revenue and in our operating results. Any downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged, and any failure of this industry to fully recover from downturns could harm our business. The semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may impact our ability to ship products. Accordingly, our operating results have varied and may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. The timing and amount of our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe need to adapt to changing technologies and technical requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe existence of opportunities for expansion; and\n\u25cf\naccess to and availability of sufficient management, technical, marketing and financial personnel.\nIf our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities or debt securities or obtain debt financing. In fiscal 2017, we generated $11.7 million in cash from our operating activities. In fiscal 2016, we generated $0.8 million in cash from our operating activities. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we made cash payments aggregating $19.3 million, net of $0.1 million of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of the Mobile IoT business, Bretelon. The amount of cash we use for the acquisitions and in support of our operations could limit our ability to execute our business plans and require us to raise additional capital in the future. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in further dilution to our shareholders. If we took on any debt, it would result in increased expenses and may result in covenants that would restrict our operations. We have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that financing, if required, will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in The Netherlands, Israel, Singapore, the United States and various other countries and states. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in tax laws in the countries in which we operate or the interpretation of such tax laws;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations relative to the US Dollar;\n\u25cf\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired developed technology and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in stock-based compensation expense;\n\u25cf\nchanges in generally accepted accounting principles; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to use our tax attributes such as research and development tax credits and net operating losses of acquired companies to the fullest extent.\nWe anticipate that a portion of our consolidated pre-tax income will continue to be subject to foreign tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the United States\u2019 federal statutory tax rate. Our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge our international tax structure, if the relative mix of United States and international income or losses changes for any reason. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our income tax rate will be less than the United States\u2019 federal statutory rate.\nWe have a history of fluctuating operating results, and we may not be able to return to profitability in the future, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have a history of fluctuating operating results. We reported a net loss of $11.0 million in fiscal 2014, a net loss of $21.7 million in fiscal 2015, net income of $0.2 million in fiscal 2016, and a net loss of $18.3 million in fiscal 2017. While we achieved profitability during fiscal 2016, it was due to a one-time event and we may not be able to achieve profitability in future periods. We recorded a one-time gain during fiscal 2016 resulting from amounts awarded from arbitration associated with the previous sale of a development project of approximately $7.6 million, without which, we would have reported a net loss. To return to operational profitability, we will need to successfully develop new products and product enhancements and sustain higher revenue while controlling our cost and expense levels. In recent years, we made significant investments in our product development efforts and have expended substantial funds to enhance our sales and marketing efforts and otherwise operate our business. However, we may not be able to realize the benefits of these investments. We may incur operating losses in future quarterly periods or fiscal years, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur sales cycle can be lengthy, which could result in uncertainty and delays in generating net revenue.\nBecause our products are based on constantly evolving technologies, we have experienced a lengthy sales cycle for some of our chipsets, particularly those designed for the Connected Smart TV Platforms market. After we have qualified a product with a customer, the customer will usually test and evaluate our product with its service provider prior to the customer completing the design of its own equipment that will incorporate our product. Our customers and the telecommunications carriers our customers serve may need approximately three months to a year to test, evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to nine months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product. Our complete sales cycle typically ranges from nine to eighteen months, but may be longer. As a result, we may experience a significant delay between the time we increase expenditures for research and development, sales and marketing efforts and inventory, and the time we generate net revenue, if any, from these expenditures. In addition, because we do not have long-term commitments from our customers, we must repeat our sales process on a continual basis even for current customers seeking to purchase a new product. As a result, our business could be harmed if a customer reduces or delays its orders, chooses not to release products incorporating our chipsets or elects not to purchase a new product or product enhancements from us.\nThe complexity of our international operations may increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business.\nWe are a global company that transacts business worldwide. For example, we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from our customers outside of North America and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future. For fiscal 2017, we derived 85% of our revenue from customers outside of North America. We also have significant international operations, including research and development facilities in Shanghai, Vietnam, Singapore, Germany, Israel, France and The Netherlands; sales and research and development facilities in Taiwan, Israel and Denmark; sales and sales support facilities in South Korea, Japan, Shenzhen and Hong Kong.\nAs a result of our international business, we are affected by economic, regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries, including the imposition of government controls, changes or limitations in trade protection laws, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws, varying statutory equity requirements, difficulties in collecting receivables and enforcing contracts, natural disasters, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions, misappropriation of intellectual property, changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates, economic instability, public health crises, acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors, which could have a material impact on our international revenue and operations. For example, we may experience reduced intellectual property protection in some countries.\nOur results of operations could also be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations, which could increase the sales price in local currencies of our products in international markets. Overseas sales and purchases to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not hedge such exposures. See \u201cForeign currency exchange rate sensitivity\u201d under Part II Item 7A and \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in this Form 10-K. Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. We also face challenges in staffing and managing our global operations. If we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial performance and operating results could suffer.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.\nLarge portions of our products are sold outside of the United States and are denominated in U.S. Dollars. As a result, sales may weaken if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, effectively increasing the cost of our products for our international customers. Our international expenses are derived from operations in foreign currencies, and these expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our overseas ODM and OEM customers by making their purchases of materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA volatile global economy could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainty in global economic conditions poses a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, which could negatively affect demand for our products. Consequently, demand for our products could be different from our expectations due to factors including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in business and economic conditions, including conditions in the credit market that could negatively affect consumer confidence;\n\u25cf\ncustomer acceptance of our products and those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in customer order patterns including order cancellations; and\n\u25cf\nreductions in the level of inventory our customers are willing to hold.\nMany of our products are incorporated into customer devices, a general slowdown in the economy or in consumer confidence could have a significant negative impact on the demand for the consumer products that incorporate our chipsets, which in turn would have a negative impact on our results of operations. There could also be a number of secondary effects from the current uncertainty in global economic conditions, such as insolvency of suppliers resulting in product delays, an inability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our chipsets or a desire of our customers to delay payment to us for the purchase of our products. Fluctuations in the global economic environment could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party manufacturers for the fabrication, assembly and testing of our chipsets and the failure of any of these third-party manufacturers to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our growth.\nWe are a fabless semiconductor company, and do not own or operate a fabrication or manufacturing facility. We depend on independent manufacturers, each of whom is a third-party manufacturer for numerous companies, to manufacture, assemble and test our products. We currently rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, and Global Foundries, or GF, to produce a majority of all of our chipsets. We rely on Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., or ASE, to assemble, package and test substantially all of our products. These third-party manufacturers may allocate capacity to the production of other companies\u2019 products while reducing product deliveries or the provision of services to us on short notice or they may increase the prices of the products and services they provide to us with little or no notice. In particular, other clients that are larger and better financed or that have long-term agreements with ASE, TSMC or GF may cause any or all of them to reallocate capacity to those clients, decreasing the capacity available to us.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our relationships with the third-party manufacturers, if we are unable to secure sufficient capacity at our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities or if any of them should experience delays, disruptions, technical or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Further, if we were required to change or add additional third-party manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites, our relationships with our customers could be harmed and our market share and operating results would suffer. If our third-party manufacturers\u2019 pricing increases and we are unable to pass along such increases to our customers, our operating results could be adversely affected. The addition of manufacturing locations or third-party subcontractors would increase the complexity of our supply chain management. Moreover, all of our product manufacturing, assembly and packaging is performed in Asian countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in these countries such as quarantines or closures of manufacturing facilities due to the outbreak of viruses such as swine flu, SARS, avian flu or any similar outbreaks. Each of these factors could harm our business and negatively impact financial results.\nIn the event we seek or are required to use a new manufacturer to fabricate or to assemble and test all or a portion of our chipset products, we may not be able to bring new manufacturers on-line rapidly enough, which could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our growth.\nWe use two main wafer foundries, and to a lesser extent, one additional foundry, to manufacture a substantial majority of our products. Moreover, we use a single source to assemble and test substantially all of our products. This practice exposes us to a substantial risk of delay, increased costs and customer dissatisfaction in the event our third-party manufacturers are unable to supply us with our chipset requirements. Particularly, during times when semiconductor capacity is limited, we may seek to, and in the event that our current foundry were to stop producing wafers for us altogether, we would be required to, qualify one or more additional wafer foundries to meet our requirements. This may be time consuming and costly. In order to bring any new foundries on-line, we would need to qualify their facilities, which could take several months. Once qualified, each new foundry would then require an additional number of months to begin producing chipsets to meet our needs, at which point our perceived need for additional capacity may have passed, or the opportunities we have previously identified may be lost to our competitors. Similarly, qualifying a new provider of assembly, packaging and testing services would be a lengthy and costly process and, in both cases, could prove to be less reliable than utilizing our existing manufacturers. If we switch to a new third party manufacturer, we may experience increased costs and expenses, as well as significant delays in the delivery of our products to customers.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth or develop our financial and managerial reporting systems, or we may need to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements of our growth, either of which could harm our business and operating results.\nTo continue to grow, we must continue to expand and improve our operational, engineering, accounting and financial systems, procedures, controls and other internal management systems. This may require substantial managerial and financial resources and our efforts may not be successful. Our current systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we fail to adequately manage our growth or to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, the quality of our products and the management of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key executive, engineering, finance and accounting, sales, marketing and support personnel. Our Chief Executive Officer has served in that role for us for over thirty years and the loss of his services could have a negative impact on our operations. The supply of highly qualified individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas, or sales people specializing in the semiconductor industry, is limited and competition for such individuals is intense. As part of our restructuring efforts in fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015 we terminated a significant number of employees and also imposed work furloughs. Our remaining employees, many of whom are highly qualified engineers, may be discomforted by these actions and may choose to seek alternative employment opportunities. The majority of our officers and key employees are not bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel to fill existing vacancies, particularly engineers and sales personnel, and the complexity and time involved in hiring and training new employees, could delay the development and introduction of new products, and negatively impact our ability to market, sell or support our existing products.\nLitigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our attention and resources.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Companies in the semiconductor industry are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices. While we are not aware of any such contemplated class action litigation against us, we may in the future be a party to such securities litigation. Any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to investigate, defend and resolve. Such costs, which include investigation and defense, the diversion of our attention and resources and any losses resulting from these claims, could significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.\nOur business is subject to seasonality, which may cause our revenue to fluctuate.\nOur business is subject to seasonality as a result of our target markets, particularly the Connected Smart TV Platforms market, which historically has peaked in the third quarter. We sell a number of our semiconductor products to our customers who manufacture products for the consumer electronics market. Our customers who manufacture products for the consumer electronics market typically experience seasonality in the sales of their products which in turn may affect the timing and volume of orders for our chipsets. We expect to experience lower sales in our first and/or fourth fiscal quarters and higher sales in our second and/or third fiscal quarters as a result of the seasonality of demand associated with the consumer electronics markets. For example, we expect that our Connected Smart TV Platforms market may experience seasonality typical of the consumer electronics markets, resulting in slower Connected Smart TV Platforms sales in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year and strongest Connected Smart TV Platforms sales in the third calendar quarter. As a result of the potential seasonality in our business, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nRegional instability in Israel may adversely affect business conditions and may disrupt our operations and negatively affect our revenues and profitability.\nAs a result of our acquisition of CopperGate in November 2009, we have engineering facilities, administrative and sales support operations and, as of January 28, 2017, we had 46 employees located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighbors, as well as incidents of civil unrest. In addition, in the past, Israel and companies doing business with Israel has been the subject of economic boycotts. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, Israel has been and is subject to civil unrest and terrorist activity, with varying levels of severity since September 2000. Recently, there has been an increase in civil unrest and political instability in the Middle East, including the recent escalation of conflict in Syria and between armed forces of the Israeli and the Palestinian Authority. Business stoppages for affected areas were and may be necessary. Any future armed conflicts, civil unrest or political instability in the region may negatively affect business conditions and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, our business insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nRegional instability in Vietnam may adversely affect business conditions and may disrupt our operations and negatively affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe have a research and development facility and, as of January 28, 2017, we had 85 employees located in Vietnam. Accordingly, political conditions in Vietnam may directly affect our business. The bilateral relations between China and Vietnam have been, and continue to be, turbulent. For example, in May 2014, China dispatched an oil rig to a contested area of the South China Sea which is claimed by both China and Vietnam. As a response, violent protests erupted in Vietnam resulting in collateral damage to factories and infrastructure. Consequently, business stoppages for affected businesses may be necessary. Any future protests due to political conflicts in the region may negatively impact business conditions and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, our business insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation brought on due to political instability in Vietnam. Although the Vietnamese government is proactively taking steps to protect against potential damages to factories and infrastructure and curtail business stoppages, there can be no assurance of their success. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe income tax benefits in Israel to which we are currently entitled from our approved enterprise program may be reduced or eliminated by the Israeli government in the future and may require us to satisfy certain specified conditions. If they are reduced or if we fail to satisfy these conditions, we may be required to pay increased taxes and may be denied these benefits in the future.\nThe Investment Center of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor has granted \u201capproved and/or beneficiary enterprise\u201d status to certain product development programs at our facility in Tel Aviv. Commencing calendar year 2014, Sigma Designs Israel\u2019s taxable income from the approved and beneficiary enterprise program was subject to a reduced tax rate for eight years, depending on the percentage of Sigma Designs Israel\u2019s share capital held by non-Israelis. The Israeli government may reduce, or eliminate in the future, tax benefits available to approved enterprise programs. Our approved and beneficiary programs and the resulting tax benefits may not continue in the future at their current levels or at any level. The termination or reduction of these tax benefits would likely increase our tax liability. Additionally, the benefits available to an approved and beneficiary enterprise program are dependent upon the fulfillment of conditions stipulated under applicable law and in the certificate of approval. If we fail to comply with these conditions, in whole or in part, we may be required to pay additional taxes for the period in which we benefited from the tax exemption or reduced tax rates and would likely be denied these benefits in the future. In either case, the amount by which our taxes would increase will depend on the difference between the then applicable tax rate for non-approved enterprises and the rate of tax, if any, that we would otherwise pay as an approved enterprise, and the amount of any taxable income that we may earn in the future. The current maximum enterprise tax rate in Israel is 25%.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC, affect our NASDAQ listing and adversely affect our stock price.\nThe SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. Our management is responsible for maintaining internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2017 and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Although we routinely review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, a failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace owed to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could negatively impact our stock price.\nOur headquarters, certain of our other facilities, and some of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers are located in active earthquake zones. Our suppliers, manufacturers and we may face earthquakes, tsunamis, floods or other types of natural disasters, which could cause resource shortages and production delays, which in turn may disrupt and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, have a research and development and sales office in Japan and outsource most of our manufacturing to Taiwan. Each of these areas is an active earthquake zone, and certain of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers conduct operations in the same regions or in other locations that are susceptible to natural disasters. The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami or flood, or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages, affecting us, our suppliers or our third-party manufacturers could cause a significant interruption in our production, business, damage or destroy our facilities or those of our suppliers and cause us to incur significant costs or result in limitations on the availability of our raw materials, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology to operate our business and any failure, inadequacy, breach, interruption or security failure of that technology or any misappropriation of any data could harm our reputation or our ability to operate our business.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party hosted services (\u201cinformation technology systems\u201d), for product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, and sales, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant resources to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. In the event our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in damage to our reputation and could cause our stock price to decline.\nIn addition, any breach of our network by data thieves or hackers may result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or potential lawsuits. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect our business and personal data. An inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors and any of these factors could adversely impact our stock price.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to reduce our expenses sufficiently to achieve profitability at current revenue levels;\n\u2022\nthe loss of one or more significant customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing models and product sales mix;\n\u2022\nunexpected reductions in unit sales and average selling prices, particularly if they occur precipitously;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe level of acceptance of our products by our customers and acceptance of our customers\u2019 products by their end user customers;\n\u2022\nan interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials included in our products;\n\u2022\navailability of third-party manufacturing capacity for production of certain products;\n\u2022\nshifts in demand for the technology embodied in our products and those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and potential unexpected delays in, our customer orders and product shipments;\n\u2022\nthe impairment and associated write-down of strategic investments that we may make from time-to-time;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ninventory obsolescence;\n\u2022\na significant increase in our effective tax rate in any particular period as a result of the exhaustion, disallowance or accelerated recognition of our net operating loss carry-forwards or otherwise;\n\u2022\ntechnical problems in the development, production ramp up and manufacturing of products, which could cause shipping delays;\n\u2022\nthe impact of potential economic instability in the United States and Asia-Pacific region, including the continued effects of the recent worldwide economic slowdown;\n\u2022\nexpenses related to implementing and maintaining a new enterprise resource management system and other information technologies; and\n\u2022\nexpenses related to our compliance efforts with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn addition, the market prices of securities of semiconductor and other technology companies have been, and continue to remain, volatile. This volatility has significantly impacted the market price of securities of many technology companies. Accordingly, shareholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price they have paid.\nOur stock price has demonstrated continued volatility in the stock market and our operating performance may cause further fluctuations in our stock price.\nThe market for our common stock has been subject to significant volatility which is expected to continue. For example, during the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017, the closing sale price per share of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market ranged from a high of $8.38 on September 15, 2016 to a low of $5.60 on December 7, 2016. This volatility may be related or proportionate to our operating performance. Our operating performance, as well as general economic and market conditions, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our company or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and California law could delay or prevent a change in control of Sigma that our shareholders may consider favorable.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our Board of Directors without prior shareholder approval, commonly referred to as \"blank check\" preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control and could adversely impact the voting power of certain shares. In addition, provisions of California law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock by discouraging a hostile bid or delaying or deterring a merger, acquisition or tender offer in which our shareholders could receive a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 10259, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "SIGM"}
