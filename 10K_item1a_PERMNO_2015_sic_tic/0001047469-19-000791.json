{"cik": "1434868", "company": "Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nExcept for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include projections about our accounting and finances, plans and objectives for the future, future operating and economic performance and other statements regarding future performance. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part II, Item 7 entitled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and elsewhere throughout this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference.\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this report. If any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Business and the Clinical Development and Commercialization of our Product Candidates\nWe depend almost entirely on the success of two product candidates, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates.\nThe bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid are currently our lead product candidates in development, and our business depends almost entirely on their successful clinical development, regulatory approvals and commercialization. We currently have no drug products for sale and may never be able to develop marketable drug products. The bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid may require substantial additional clinical development, testing, and regulatory approvals before we are permitted to commence their commercialization. The clinical studies of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the U.S. and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any product candidate. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical studies that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication. This process can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance, including a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS program. Of the large number of drugs in development in the U.S., only a small percentage successfully complete the approval process at the FDA, EMA or any other foreign regulatory agency, and are commercialized. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid or any other of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. On February 20, 2019 and on February 26, 2019, we submitted the NDAs for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet to the FDA, respectively. In addition, the EMA completed formal validation of the MAAs for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet. The MAAs for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet were submitted to the EMA on February 11, 2019.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the U.S. or Europe until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, MAA from the EMA, or in any other foreign countries until we\nreceive the requisite approval from such countries. As a condition to submitting an NDA or MAA for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia for an LDL-C lowering indication, we completed the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (1002FDC-053) in addition to the global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program for bempedoic acid and ten Phase 2 clinical studies. As a condition to submitting an NDA or MAA for bempedoic acid to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia for a CVD risk reduction indication, we have initiated and intend to complete the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT.\nAdditionally, we submitted our NDAs and MAAs for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet for LDL-C lowering indications in February 2019. Based on the FDA's guidance, we believe that these programs are adequate to support approval of an LDL-C lowering indication. However, there is no guarantee that the FDA will view results from our Phase 3 1002FDC-053 clinical study or global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program alone as sufficient to support approval of an LDL-C lowering indication for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid. In the event that FDA determines LDL-C lowering is no longer a surrogate endpoint for initial approval of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid in the future, we would plan to submit our NDA for bempedoic acid with a proposed indication of CV risk reduction in statin intolerant patients on the basis of a completed and successful CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, which would include the results of the global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, by 2022. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a complex, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations, including with respect to whether LDL-C lowering is a surrogate endpoint for initial approval of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory authorities may change their approval policies for an LDL-C lowering indication for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid if there is a shift in the future standard-of-care for statin intolerant patients with hypercholesterolemia;\n\u2022 we may not be able to demonstrate that the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid are safe and effective in treating patients with hypercholesterolemia to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency;\n\u2022 the results of our clinical studies may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or EMA for marketing approval;\n\u2022 the magnitude of the treatment effect must also be clinically meaningful along with the drug's safety for a favorable benefit/risk assessment by the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency may change in the future the number, design, size, duration, patient enrollment criteria, exposure of patients, or conduct or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency may require that we conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency may not approve the formulation, specifications or labeling of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid;\n\u2022 the clinical research organizations, or CROs, that we retain to conduct our clinical studies may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical studies;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency may find the data from preclinical studies and clinical studies insufficient to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid outweigh the safety risks;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical studies;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency may not accept data generated at our clinical study sites;\n\u2022 if our NDAs are reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our applications or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical studies, limitations in approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency may require the development of a REMS as a condition of approval or post-approval; or\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract.\nAny of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid. Moreover, because our business is almost entirely dependent upon these product candidates, any setback in our pursuit of its regulatory approval would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe development and approvals required for the approval of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet are substantially identical to those for bempedoic acid, and the risks relating to the clinical development and approval of bempedoic acid apply equally to the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet. The FDA accepted our submission of an IND application for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet in the second quarter of 2016 and we completed a bioavailability study. We announced the clinical development and regulatory plans for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet in June 2017 and announced the results of the Phase 3 1002FDC-053 clinical study in August 2018. Any failure in our development of bempedoic acid would materially and adversely affect our ability to develop, seek approval for and commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet for the planned indications. In addition, even if bempedoic acid succeeds in its clinical development and is approved for one or more indications, there can be no assurance that the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet would be developed successfully and approved for the same indications or at all, and vice versa.\nFailures or delays in the completion of our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT for bempedoic acid could result in increased costs to us and could delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.\nIn December 2016, we initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT. The completion of the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT or any of our other ongoing clinical studies can be delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory authority may not agree to the study design or overall program;\n\u2022 the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory authority may place a clinical study on hold;\n\u2022 delays in reaching or failing to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and study sites;\n\u2022 inadequate quantity or quality of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical studies;\n\u2022 difficulties or delays obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical study at a prospective site or sites;\n\u2022 challenges in recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical studies or in our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, eligibility criteria for the clinical study, the nature of the clinical study protocol, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant disease and competition from other clinical study programs, including PCSK9 inhibitors, for similar indications;\n\u2022 severe or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical study, including instances of muscle pain or weakness or other side effects;\n\u2022 reports from preclinical or clinical testing of other cardiometabolic therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns; and\n\u2022 difficulties retaining patients who have enrolled in a clinical study but may be prone to withdraw due to rigors of the study, lack of efficacy, side effects, personal issues or loss of interest.\nClinical studies may also be delayed or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the EMA, the IRBs at the sites where the IRBs are overseeing a clinical study, a data safety monitoring committee, or DMC, overseeing the clinical study at issue or any other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022 failure to conduct the clinical study in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022 inspection of the clinical study operations or study sites by the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory authorities that reveals deficiencies or violations that require us to undertake corrective action, including the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022 changes in government regulations or administrative actions;\n\u2022 problems with clinical supply materials; and\n\u2022 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study.\nPositive results from completed Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid are not necessarily predictive of the results of our ongoing CLEAR Outcomes CVOT of bempedoic acid or any other of our clinical studies, nor do they guarantee approval of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid by the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory agency. If we cannot replicate the positive results from our completed Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid in our CVOT or other ongoing and/or planned clinical studies, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory status for and commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid.\nThere is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical studies. Even if we are able to complete our ongoing CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, the positive results from our completed Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of bempedoic acid and our Phase 3 1002FDC-053 clinical study of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet, may not be replicated in our ongoing CLEAR Outcomes CVOT or any future studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, nor do they guarantee approval of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid by the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory authorities in a timely manner or at all. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks\nin late-stage clinical studies after achieving positive results earlier in development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical studies were underway or safety or efficacy observations made in clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development. If we fail to obtain positive results in the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT or any future clinical studies, the regulatory status of our product candidates or future product candidates, and correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may need substantial additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nWe reported top-line results from our Phase 3 (1002-048) in March 2018. In May 2018, we reported top-line results from the 52-week long-term safety study, Study 1 (1002-040) and from Study 3 (1002-046). We reported top-line results from the Phase 3 1002FDC-053 study of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet in August 2018. In October 2018, we reported top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) and announced the completion of the Phase 3 LDL-C lowering development program of bempedoic acid and positive cumulative results. However, there is no guarantee that the FDA will view results from our Phase 3 1002FDC-053 clinical study or global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program alone as sufficient to support approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid. On February 20, 2019 and February 26, 2019, we submitted the NDAs for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet to the FDA, respectively, for LDL-C lowering indications. In addition, the EMA completed formal validation of the MAAs for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet for LDL-C lowering indications. The MAAs for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet were submitted to the EMA on February 11, 2019.\nIn the event that regulatory agencies determine LDL-C lowering is no longer a surrogate endpoint for initial approval of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid in the future, we would plan to submit our NDA or MAA for bempedoic acid (monotherapy) for a CV risk reduction indication on the basis of a completed and successful CVOT, which would include the results of the global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, by 2022. We expect that these clinical studies, plus any additional clinical studies that we undertake for the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, will consume substantial additional financial resources. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, and proceeds to be received in the future under the DSE collaboration agreement, will be sufficient to fund operations through the expected approvals of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid and the commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved by LDL-C lowering as a surrogate endpoint. We may, however, need to secure additional cash resources to continue to fund the commercialization and further clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid. Our future capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors including:\n\u2022 the scope, size, rate of progress, results and costs of completing our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT of bempedoic acid;\n\u2022 the cost, timing and outcome of our efforts to obtain marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid;\n\u2022 our initial commercial sales, and our ability to secure and maintain reimbursement coverage, if bempedoic acid or the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet are approved;\n\u2022 the costs associated with commercializing the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid or any future product candidates if we receive marketing approval, including the cost and timing of developing sales and marketing capabilities or entering into strategic collaborations to market and sell the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid or any future product candidates;\n\u2022 DSE's ability to successfully commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid in the Territory, if approved.\n\u2022 the number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we develop or acquire;\n\u2022 the cost of manufacturing the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid or any future product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize; and\n\u2022 the costs associated with general corporate activities, such as the cost of filing, prosecuting and enforcing patent claims.\nChanging circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate. Because the outcome of any clinical study is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid and any future product candidates. Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If adequate funds are unavailable to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may not be able to continue the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid or any future product candidate, or to commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid or any future product candidate, if approved.\nWe are an emerging pharmaceutical company and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception, and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have a limited operating history on which to base your investment decision. Pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We were incorporated in January 2008. Our operations to date have been limited primarily to organizing and staffing our company and conducting research and development activities for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid. We have never generated any revenue from product sales. We have not obtained regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates. As such, we are subject to all the risks incident to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors.\nSince our inception, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on developing bempedoic acid, which commenced Phase 3 clinical development in January 2016. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, public offerings of common stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants and the incurrence of indebtedness, and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our net losses were $201.8 million, $167.0 million and $75.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $598.1 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development program and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur increasing levels of operating losses over the next several years and for the foreseeable future. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our\nstockholders' equity and working capital. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future related to the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT and as we prepare for commercial launch activities. Our research and development expenses are expected to continue in the foreseeable future as they relate to our ongoing CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, our NDA and MAA submissions and any other early-stage development programs or additional indications we choose to pursue. In addition, in anticipation of marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, we will also incur significant sales, marketing and outsourced manufacturing expenses and expect further significant increases in our general and administration expenses in connection with the commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, respectively. As a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. Even if we do become profitable, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nChanges in regulatory requirements, FDA or EMA guidance or unanticipated events, including in our CVOT of bempedoic acid, may occur, which may result in changes to clinical study protocols or additional clinical study requirements, which could result in increased costs to us and could delay our development timeline.\nChanges in regulatory requirements, FDA or EMA guidance or unanticipated events during our clinical studies may force us to amend clinical study protocols or the FDA or EMA may impose additional clinical study requirements. Significant amendments to our clinical study protocols may require resubmission to the FDA and/or IRBs for review and approval, which may adversely impact the cost, timing and/or successful completion of these studies. If we experience substantial delays completing-or if we terminate our CVOT, or if we are required to conduct additional clinical studies, the commercial prospects for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed.\nWe may not be able to identify and enroll the requisite number of patients in our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, or any study that we undertake to support the development of our product candidates. Even if we are successful in enrolling patients, we may not ultimately be able to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefits from the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, and our failure to do so may delay or hinder our ability to obtain FDA or EMA approval for these product candidates. On February 20, 2019 and February 26, 2019, we submitted the NDAs for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet to the FDA, respectively, based on the FDA's recent guidance that these programs are adequate to support approval of an LDL-C lowering. However, the FDA has indicated its position regarding an LDL-C lowering indication could be impacted by potential future changes in their view of LDL-C lowering as a surrogate endpoint or the possibility of a shift in the future standard-of-care for statin intolerant patients with hypercholesterolemia, and there is no guarantee that the FDA will view results from our Phase 3 1002FDC-053 clinical study and global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program alone as sufficient to support approvals of an LDL-C lowering indication. Conducting our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT is costly and time-consuming, and any requirement to complete the CVOT prior to approval of bempedoic acid would adversely affect our development timeline and financial condition.\nWe have limited experience using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to submit an NDA or any similar drug approval application to the FDA, and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval.\nWe are developing bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet for which we are seeking FDA approval through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The Drug Price Competition and Patent\nTerm Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2) allows an NDA we submit to FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA's prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for these product candidates, and complications and risks associated with these product candidates, would likely substantially increase. We could need to obtain additional funding, which could result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of our existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which would likely materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to accelerated product development or earlier approval.\nMoreover, even if our product candidates, including the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet, are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.\nEven if we receive marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, we may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we receive marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid's indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing\nrequirements for potentially costly post-approval studies, such as a CVOT. The bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the packaging, storage, labeling, advertising and promotion of the product, recordkeeping and submission of safety updates and other post-marketing information. The FDA has significant post-marketing authority, including, for example, the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-marketing studies or clinical studies to evaluate serious safety risks related to the use of a drug product. The FDA also has the authority to require, as part of an NDA or post-approval, the submission of a REMS. Any REMS required by the FDA may lead to increased costs to assure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements and potential requirements or restrictions on the sale of approved products, all of which could lead to lower sales volume and revenue. The EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may impose similar requirements on the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid as those described above with respect to the FDA.\nManufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices and other regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discover problems with the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, the manufacturer or us, including requiring withdrawal of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid or the manufacturing facilities for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may, among other things:\n\u2022 issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022 seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022 suspend or withdraw marketing approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u2022 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us;\n\u2022 suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or request that we initiate a product recall.\nEven if we receive marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid in the U.S., we may never receive regulatory approval to market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid outside of the U.S., and vice versa.\nIn order to market any product outside of the U.S., including for DSE to market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid in Europe, we must establish and comply with the numerous and varying efficacy, safety and other regulatory requirements of the countries in which we intend to market our product. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product candidate testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approvals in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval processes in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the U.S. as well as other risks, or vice versa. In particular, in many countries outside of the\nU.S., products must receive pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be commercialized. Obtaining this approval can result in substantial delays in bringing products to market in such countries. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain marketing approval in other countries or any delay or other setback in obtaining such approval would impair our ability to commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid in such foreign markets. Any such impairment would reduce the size of our potential market, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we receive marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, it may not achieve broad market acceptance, which would limit the revenue that we generate from its sales.\nThe commercial success of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, will depend upon the awareness and acceptance of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid among the medical community, including physicians, patients and healthcare payors. Market acceptance of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022 the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid's demonstrated ability to treat statin intolerant patients for LDL-C lowering or CV risk reduction as an add-on for patients already on statin therapy, as compared with other available therapies;\n\u2022 the relative convenience and ease of administration of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, including as compared with other treatments for patients for LDL-C lowering or CV risk reduction;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects such as muscle pain or weakness;\n\u2022 limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid by the FDA;\n\u2022 availability of alternative treatments, including a number of competitive therapies already approved for LDL-C lowering or CV risk reduction, including PCSK9 inhibitors, or expected to be commercially launched in the near future;\n\u2022 pricing and cost effectiveness;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our, and in Europe, DSE's, sales and marketing strategies, as well as the effectiveness of any other future collaborators;\n\u2022 our ability to increase awareness of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid through marketing efforts;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u2022 the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.\nIf the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by patients, physicians and payors, we may not generate sufficient revenue from the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid to become or remain profitable. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors about the benefits of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, we may not be able to generate any revenue.\nWe are establishing our commercialization and distribution capabilities to support the sales, marketing and distribution of our pharmaceutical products. In order to market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved by the FDA or any other regulatory body, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial, and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, we recently entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with DSE for the commercialization of bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet in Europe. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, or if we are unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, physicians and patients using other LDL-C lowering therapies may choose not to switch to our product.\nPhysicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective, safe or convenient treatments enter the market. In addition, patients often acclimate to the brand or type of therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due to lack of reimbursement for existing therapies. If physicians or patients are reluctant to switch from existing therapies to the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved, our operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nThe commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet, if approved, depends on the continued availability and use of ezetimibe by the target patient of this combination therapy.\nThe bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet is dependent on the continued availability and use of ezetimibe in the marketplace, and there can be no assurance that the current availability and use of ezetimibe will continue. For example, changes in standard of care or use patterns of ezetimibe could make our bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet therapy obsolete. In addition, ezetimibe could encounter unexpected results in the future and be associated with adverse outcomes during long-term use. Finally, the producers of ezetimibe are under no obligation to continue producing, commercializing or making ezetimibe available to patients, or to continue producing ezetimibe in any particular quantity, which could prevent our ability to obtain ezetimibe. For example, such producers may encounter manufacturing or other production issues and fail to produce enough ezetimibe, and this could cause our commercialization efforts, if the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet is approved, to fail or be significantly delayed.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may adversely affect the FDA's review of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid for LDL-C lowering in patients or the use or commercial viability of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved for any indication or patient population.\nGovernment agencies issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, including guidelines generally relating to therapeutically significant LDL-C levels. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health or science foundations and other organizations involved in the research, treatment and prevention of various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the medical and patient communities. These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage and use of related or competing therapies. For example,\norganizations such as the AHA have made recommendations about therapies in the cardiovascular therapeutics market. In addition, while we reached an agreement with the FDA on the definition of statin intolerance, there is no guarantee that the FDA's view of this definition would not change in the future. We expect that the FDA's view of the standard of care for patients with hypercholesterolemia for LDL-C lowering indications in patients with hypercholesterolemia could impact the evaluation of such NDAs, including how this standard of care evolves in light of guidelines and recommendations in respect of the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. In addition, following any approval, we expect that changes to these existing recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nEven if approved, reimbursement policies could limit our ability to sell the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid.\nMarket acceptance and sales of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for those medications. Cost containment is a primary concern in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere. Government authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid and, if reimbursement is available, the level of such reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly in Canada and European countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost-effectiveness of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid with other available therapies. If reimbursement for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid is unavailable in any country in which we seek reimbursement, if it is limited in scope or amount, if it is conditioned upon our completion of additional clinical studies, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future product development programs for candidates other than the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid may require substantial financial resources and may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nIn addition to the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, we may in the future pursue the development of other early-stage development programs. If we conduct any clinical studies for our future product candidates, there will be a number of FDA requirements that we must satisfy before we can commence such clinical studies. Satisfaction of these requirements will entail substantial time, effort and financial resources. We may never satisfy these requirements. Any time, effort and financial resources we expend on any early-stage development programs that we may pursue may adversely affect our ability to continue development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, and we may never commence clinical studies of such development programs despite expending significant resources in pursuit of their development. If we do commence clinical studies of our other potential product candidates, such product candidates may never be approved by the FDA.\nRecent federal legislation will increase pressure to reduce prices of pharmaceutical products paid for by Medicare, which could materially adversely affect our revenue, if any, and our results of operations.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the scope of coverage and the price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may cause a similar reduction in payments from private payors. This legislation may pose an even greater risk to the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid than some other pharmaceutical products because a significant portion of the target patient population for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid would likely be over 65 years of age and, therefore, many such patients will be covered by Medicare.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, or ACA, became law in the United States. The goal of the PPACA is to reduce the cost of healthcare and substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers.\nThe ACA, among other things, increases minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One such Executive Order directed federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. The loss of the cost share reduction payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA.\nFurther, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year through 2027. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, including eliminating a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the \"individual mandate,\" effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nFurther, the Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. The Trump administration released a \"Blueprint\" to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. In response to the Blueprint, on November 30, 2018, CMS announced a proposed rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. Among other things, the proposed rule changes would allow Medicare Advantage plans to use pre authorization (PA) and step therapy (ST) for six protected classes of drugs, with certain exceptions, permit plans to implement PA and ST in Medicare Part B drugs; changes the definition of \"negotiated prices\" in the regulations, and adds a definition of \"price concession\". It is unclear whether these proposed changes we be accepted, and if so, what effect such changes will have on our business and our ability to receive adequate reimbursement for our future products.\nWe cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022 the demand for any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022 our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;\n\u2022 our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022 the level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nWe expect that changes and challenges to the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies, and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any future approved product.\nFinally, the availability of generic LDL-C lowering treatments may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for branded counterparts or other competitive LDL-C lowering therapies, such as the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid if it is approved for commercial distribution. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nFederal legislation and actions by state governments may permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may face competition for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved, from cheaper LDL-C lowering therapies sourced from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. The MMA contains provisions that may change U.S. importation laws and expand pharmacists' and wholesalers' ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. These changes to U.S. importation laws will not take effect unless and until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has so far declined to approve a reimportation plan. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop, including the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. If we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid if approved. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product's approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid as a therapy for lowering LDL-C levels in statin intolerant patients with elevated LDL-C, the first indication we intend to pursue, physicians may nevertheless prescribe the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, potentially including as a therapy in addition to statins. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur market is subject to intense competition. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, if approved, will be materially adversely affected.\nThe LDL-C lowering therapies market is highly competitive and dynamic and dominated by the sale of inexpensive generic versions of statins. In 2017, generic statins, ezetimibe, and fixed combination drugs accounted for about 93% of U.S. prescriptions within the cholesterol / LDL-C lowering market. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain a share of the market, initially, for patients with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD and/or HeFH, including high cardiovascular risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy, or only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of their statin and are therefore considered to be statin intolerant. Potential competitors in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies. Other pharmaceutical companies may develop LDL-C lowering therapies for patients that compete with the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved, that do not infringe the claims of our patents, pending patent applications or other proprietary rights, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. The FDA has also indicated to us that approval of other therapies could have an impact on their review of our NDAs for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid for our LDL-C lowering programs in these patients.\nLipid lowering therapies currently on the market that would compete with the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid include the following:\n\u2022 Inexpensive generic versions of statins;\n\u2022 Inexpensive generic versions of ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor;\n\u2022 PCSK9 inhibitors such as Praluent\u00ae (alirocumab) and Repatha\u00ae (evolocumab), marketed by Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen Inc. respectively;\n\u2022 Bile acid sequestrants such as Welchol\u00ae (colesevelam), marketed by Daiichi Sankyo Inc.;\n\u2022 MTP inhibitors, such as JUXTAPID\u00ae (lomitapide), marketed by Novelion Therapeutics, Inc.;\n\u2022 Apo B Anti-Sense therapy, such as KYNAMRO\u00ae (mipomersen), marketed by Kastle Therapeutics LLC;\n\u2022 Inexpensive generic versions of combination tablet therapies, such as ezetimibe and simvastatin;\n\u2022 Triglyceride lowering therapy such as Vascepa\u00ae (icosapent ethyl), marketed by Amarin Corporation; and\n\u2022 Other lipid-lowering monotherapies (including cheaper generic versions), such as Tricor\u00ae (fenofibrate) and Niaspan\u00ae (niacin extended release), both of which are marketed by AbbVie, Inc.\nSeveral other pharmaceutical companies have other LDL-C lowering therapies in development that may be approved for marketing in the U.S. or outside of the U.S. Based on publicly available information, we believe the current therapies in development that would compete with the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid include PCSK9 inhibitors in development from Lilly and The Medicines Company/Alnylam.\nMany of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience discovering and developing drug candidates, obtaining FDA and other marketing approvals of products and commercializing those products.\nAccordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors' drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, if approved, and may render the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing it. If approved, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid may also compete with unapproved and off-label LDL-C lowering treatments, and following the expiration of additional patents covering the LDL-C lowering market, we may also face additional competition from the entry of new generic drugs. We anticipate that we will encounter intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and, if claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid in clinical studies and the sale of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved, exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, including as a result of interactions with alcohol or other drugs, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we become subject to product liability claims and cannot successfully defend ourselves against them, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in, among other things:\n\u2022 withdrawal of patients from our clinical studies;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022 decreased demand for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid or any future product candidates following marketing approval, if obtained;\n\u2022 damage to our reputation and exposure to adverse publicity;\n\u2022 increased FDA warnings on product labels;\n\u2022 litigation costs;\n\u2022 distraction of management's attention from our primary business;\n\u2022 loss of revenue; and\n\u2022 the inability to successfully commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid or any future product candidates, if approved.\nWe maintain product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies with a $10.0 million annual aggregate coverage limit, in addition to insurance coverage in specific local jurisdictions. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses, including if insurance coverage becomes increasingly expensive. If and when we obtain marketing approval for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may not be able to obtain this product liability\ninsurance on commercially reasonable terms. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, particularly in light of the size of our business and financial resources. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if we are unsuccessful in defending such a claim or claims and the resulting judgments exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved. Our future arrangements with third-party payors will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022 The federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item, or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\u2022 The federal criminal and civil false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\n\u2022 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters.\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization.\n\u2022 The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n\u2022 The federal transparency requirements under the PPACA require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\n\u2022 Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing.\nEnsuring that our future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations, including anticipated activities to be conducted by our sales team, were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party clinical research organizations and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid could be delayed.\nWe could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the information systems and networks of our company and our vendors, including personal information of our employees and patients, and company and vendor confidential data. In addition, outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our vendors or fraudulently induce our personnel or the personnel of our vendors to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data and/or systems. We may experience threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, phishing and\nother cyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. If a material breach of our information technology systems or those of our vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and our reputation and credibility could be damaged. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. In addition, we could be subject to regulatory actions and/or claims made by individuals and groups in private litigation involving privacy issues related to data collection and use practices and other data privacy laws and regulations, including claims for misuse or inappropriate disclosure of data, as well as unfair or deceptive practices. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. As we outsource more of our information systems to vendors, engage in more electronic transactions with payors and patients, and rely more on cloud-based information systems, the related security risks will increase and we will need to expend additional resources to protect our technology and information systems. In addition, there can be no assurance that our internal information technology systems or those of our third-party contractors, or our consultants' efforts to implement adequate security and control measures, will be sufficient to protect us against breakdowns, service disruption, data deterioration or loss in the event of a system malfunction, or prevent data from being stolen or corrupted in the event of a cyberattack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks or insider threat attacks which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm.\nComprehensive Tax Reform Legislation Could Adversely Affect Our Business And Financial Condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA) that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \"worldwide\" system of taxation to a territorial system. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities have been revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The impact of this tax reform is uncertain and could be adverse.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or maintain issued patents which are sufficient to protect the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, others could compete against us more directly, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our success obtaining and maintaining issued patents and other intellectual property rights in the United States and elsewhere and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our patent estate, including patents we own, on a worldwide basis, included approximately 24 issued United States patents and 12 pending United States patent applications and 19 issued patents and 45 pending patent applications in other foreign jurisdictions. Of our worldwide patent estate, only a subset of our patents and pending patent applications relates to our bempedoic acid program.\nBempedoic acid is claimed in U.S. Patent No. 7,335,799 that is scheduled to expire in December 2025, which includes 711 days of patent term adjustment, and may be eligible for a patent term extension period of up to five years. U.S. Patent Nos. 9,000,041, 8,497,301, 9,624,152 and 10,118,881 claim methods of using bempedoic acid. There are currently six issued patents and one pending application in countries outside the United States that relate to bempedoic acid and its use. Furthermore, of the six granted patents, we have two granted European patents that have been validated in numerous European countries including France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\nIn addition, we have three patent families in which we are pursuing patent protection for our bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid in combination with one or more statins. We have one pending U.S. patent application and 18 pending applications outside the U.S. with claims directed to methods of treatment using the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination. Additionally, we own one pending U.S. patent application and three pending applications outside the U.S. directed to the manufacturing of our bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet. We also have one pending U.S. patent application and 18 pending applications outside the U.S., with claims directed to methods of treatment using a fixed dose combination of bempedoic acid and one or more statins.\nWe may not have identified all patents, published applications or published literature that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our drug candidates, by preventing the patentability of one or more aspects of our drug candidates to us or our licensors or co-owners, or by covering the same or similar technologies that may affect our ability to market our drug candidates. For example, we (or the licensor of a drug candidate to us) may not have conducted a patent clearance search to identify potentially obstructing third party patents. Moreover, patent applications in the United States are maintained in confidence for up to 18 months after their filing. In some cases, however, patent applications remain confidential in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, for the entire time prior to issuance as a U.S. patent. Patent applications filed in countries outside of the United States are not typically published until at least 18 months from their first filing date. Similarly, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. We cannot be certain that we or our licensors or co-owners were the first to invent, or the first to file, patent applications covering our drug candidates. We also may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents.\nOthers may have filed patent applications or received patents that conflict with patents or patent applications that we own, have filed or have licensed, either by claiming the same methods, compounds or uses or by claiming methods, compounds or uses that could dominate those owned by or licensed to us. In addition, we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may affect our ability to make, use or sell any of our drug candidates. Any conflicts resulting from third-party patent applications and patents could affect our ability to obtain the necessary patent protection for our products or processes. If other companies or entities obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms or at all. Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from using discovery-related technology to pursue the development or commercialization of our drug candidates, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our patents have, or that any of our pending patent applications will mature into issued patents that will include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid or any other product candidates. Others have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our approach, and may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that may overlap or conflict with\nour patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or formulations or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the issuance, scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, ex parte reexamination, inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings, supplemental examination and may be challenged in district court. Patents granted in certain other countries may be subjected to revocation, opposition or comparable proceedings lodged in various national and regional patent offices, and national courts. These proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re- examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, supplemental examination, opposition, or revocation proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we may own or exclusively license may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference proceeding can result in a third-party receiving the patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to develop, market or otherwise commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid.\nFurthermore, the issuance of a patent, while presumed valid and enforceable, is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees and current employees. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. If these developments were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our sales.\nFurthermore, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we have or are pursuing patent protection for our product candidates. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, but the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nOur ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It is difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the components that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor's or potential competitor's product. Any litigation to enforce or defend our patent rights, if any, even if we were to prevail, could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If, in any proceeding, a court invalidated or found unenforceable our patents covering the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, our financial position and results of operations would be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, our financial position and results of operations would also be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022 any of our patents, or any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope and patent term sufficient to protect the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid;\n\u2022 any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022 we will be able to successfully commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, if approved, before our relevant patents expire;\n\u2022 we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022 we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022 others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents;\n\u2022 any of our patents will be valid and enforceable;\n\u2022 any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022 we will develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are separately patentable; or\n\u2022 that our commercial activities or products, or those of our licensors, will not infringe upon the patents of others.\nWe rely upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. It is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Further, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific\ncollaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, vendors and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets.\nMoreover, because we acquired certain rights from Pfizer, we must rely on Pfizer's practices, and those of its predecessors, with regard to parties that may have had access to our trade secrets related thereto before our incorporation. Any party with whom we or they have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they disclose such trade secrets, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed, either intentionally or unintentionally, to or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that our business, products and methods do not or will not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may allege that the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid or the use of our technologies infringe patent claims or other intellectual property rights held by them or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. For example, we aware of U.S. patents relating to compositions containing ezetimibe. Although we believe that our bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet would not infringe a claim of such patents, the owner of such patents may disagree and initiate a patent infringement action against us. Patent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and their outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney's fees if we are found to be willfully infringing another party's patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other consideration going forward if we are forced to take a license. In addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us and we could not obtain such a license, we may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court, or redesign our products. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022 cease developing, selling or otherwise commercializing the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid;\n\u2022 pay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022 obtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022 redesign, or rename in the case of trademark claims, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may not be possible and, even if possible, could be costly and time-consuming.\nAny of these risks coming to fruition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nThe United States has enacted the America Invents Act of 2011, which is wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe could become dependent on licensed intellectual property. If we were to lose our rights to licensed intellectual property, we may not be able to continue developing or commercializing the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid or other product candidates, if approved.\nIn the future, we may enter into license(s) to third-party intellectual property that are necessary or useful to our business. Such license agreement(s) will likely impose various obligations upon us, and our licensor(s) may have the right to terminate the license thereunder in the event of a material breach or, in some cases, at will. Future licensor(s) may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them and accordingly seek to terminate our license or decide to terminate our license at will. If successful, this could result in our loss of the right to use the licensed intellectual property, which could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize a product candidate or product, if approved, as well as harm our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nWe do not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some\ncountries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to emerging pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nOur employees have been previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we are not aware of any claims currently pending against us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers of our employees. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying money claims, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, which would materially adversely affect our commercial development efforts.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf a collaborative partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations under an agreement with us, the commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid could be delayed or terminated.\nIn January 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with DSE, pursuant to which DSE will be responsible for the commercialization of, if approved, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid in the DSE Territory. We may also enter into similar arrangements with other partners or collaborators to the commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, outside of the United States and Europe, or to further commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid in the broader cholesterol modifying market in the United States, if approved. If DSE or any of our future\ncollaborative partners does not devote sufficient time and resources to the collaboration arrangement with us, we may not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement, and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, if DSE or any such future collaboration partner were to breach or terminate its arrangements with us, the commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid on our own in such locations.\nPursuant to the collaboration arrangement with DSE, we will receive significant commercial and regulatory milestone payments, as well as tiered fifteen percent (15%) to twenty-five percent (25%) royalties on certain net DSE Territory sales. Similar to this collaboration arrangement, much of the potential revenue from future collaborations may consist of contingent payments, such as payments for achieving regulatory milestones or royalties payable on sales of drugs. The milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive under these collaborations will depend upon our collaborators' ability to successfully introduce, market and sell new products. In addition, collaborators may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize products developed under collaborations using our technologies, which could reduce the milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive, if any. DSE and our future collaboration partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products using our products or technologies because they:\n\u2022 decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite expertise, limited cash resources or specialized equipment limitations, or the belief that other drug development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining marketing approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u2022 decide to pursue other technologies or develop other product candidates, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, to treat the same diseases targeted by our own collaborative programs;\n\u2022 do not have sufficient resources necessary to carry the product candidate through clinical development, marketing approval and commercialization; or\n\u2022 cannot obtain the necessary marketing approvals.\nCompetition may negatively impact a partner's focus on and commitment to the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid and, as a result, could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid outside of the United States or in the broader cholesterol modifying market in the United States. If DSE and our future collaboration partners fail to develop or effectively commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid for any of these reasons, our sales of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, if approved, may be limited, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe will be unable to directly control all aspects of our clinical studies due to our reliance on CROs and other third parties that assist us in conducting clinical studies.\nWe relied on CROs in our prior clinical studies, including our global pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies and our pivotal Phase 3 1002FDC-053 clinical study, and will continue to rely on CROs to conduct our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, as well as any future clinical studies we may undertake. As a result, we will have less direct control over the conduct, timing and completion of these clinical studies and the management of data developed through the clinical studies than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. Communicating with outside parties can also be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities. Outside parties may:\n\u2022 have staffing difficulties;\n\u2022 fail to comply with contractual obligations;\n\u2022 experience regulatory compliance issues;\n\u2022 undergo changes in priorities or become financially distressed; or\n\u2022 form relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors.\nThese factors may materially adversely affect the willingness or ability of third parties to conduct our clinical studies and may subject us to unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control.\nMoreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical studies to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical study participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.\nProblems with the timeliness or quality of the work of any CRO may lead us to seek to terminate our relationship with any such CRO and use an alternative service provider. Making this change may be costly and may delay our clinical studies, and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible to effect. If we must replace any CRO that is conducting our clinical studies, our clinical studies may have to be suspended until we find another CRO that offers comparable services. The time that it takes us to find alternative organizations may cause a delay in the commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid or may cause us to incur significant expenses to replicate data that may be lost. Although we do not believe that any CRO on which we may rely will offer services that are not available elsewhere, it may be difficult to find a replacement organization that can conduct our clinical studies in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost. Any delay in or inability to complete our clinical studies could significantly compromise our ability to secure regulatory approval of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid and preclude our ability to commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, thereby limiting or preventing our ability to generate revenue from its sales.\nWe rely completely on third-party suppliers to manufacture our clinical drug supplies for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid and preclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidate.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to internally manufacture our clinical drug supply of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, or any future product candidates, for use in the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical studies, and we lack the internal resources and the capability to manufacture any product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. In addition, we have no control over the production of ezetimibe for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug for bempedoic acid, or any future product candidates, must be approved by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies pursuant to inspections that would be conducted after submission of our NDA or relevant foreign regulatory submission to the applicable regulatory agency.\nWe do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no direct control over our contract manufacturers' ability to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified\npersonnel. Furthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may affect the regulatory clearance of our contract manufacturers' facilities generally. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would adversely impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates.\nIf we do not establish successful collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid.\nOur drug development programs and commercialization plans for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. We may develop and initially commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid in the United States without a partner. However, in order to pursue the broader cholesterol modifying market in the United States, we may also enter into a partnership or co-promotion arrangement with an established pharmaceutical company that has a larger sales force. In January 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with DSE, pursuant to which DSE will be responsible for the commercialization of, if approved, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid in the DSE Territory. We may enter into additional collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid outside of the United States and the DSE Territory. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and these collaboration agreements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development or delay commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid in certain geographies, reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, reduce the scope of our commercialization plans, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities outside of the United States and the DSE Territory on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRisks Related to General Business, Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe will need to develop and expand our company, and we may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect that we will continue to increase our workforce and the scope of our operations, including as we build our commercial sales capabilities. To manage our anticipated development and expansion, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure; or give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than anticipated, our ability\nto generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain members of our senior management team, and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on members of our senior management team. We have entered into employment agreements with these individuals, but any employee may terminate his or her employment with us. Although we do not have any reason to believe that we will lose the services of these individuals in the foreseeable future, the loss of the services of these individuals might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. We rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions. Failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.\nOur company lacks experience commercializing products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will need to transition from a company with a development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We intend to build a sales force but may be unsuccessful in making such a transition. These are our company's first NDAs and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain marketing approval for or commercialize a product candidate. Therefore, our clinical development and regulatory approval process may involve more inherent risk, take longer, and cost more than it would if we were a company with a more significant operating history and had experience obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing a product candidate.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including violating applicable regulatory standards and requirements or engaging in insider trading, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and applicable non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and applicable non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of, including trading on, information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may be ineffective in controlling unknown or\nunmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIn order to satisfy our obligations as a publicly traded company, we may need to hire qualified accounting and financial personnel with appropriate public company experience.\nAs a public company, we need to establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and our corporate governance practices that we have adopted. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial personnel with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge, and it may be difficult to recruit and maintain such personnel. Even if we are able to hire appropriate personnel, our existing operating expenses and operations will be impacted by the direct costs of their employment and the indirect consequences related to the diversion of management resources from product development efforts.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate product revenue. To date, we have not generated any revenue from sales of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any such revenue. We do not expect to generate significant revenue, other than the revenue derived from the upfront payment in connection with the collaboration arrangement with DSE, unless and until we obtain marketing approval of, and begin to sell, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid. Our ability to generate revenue depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022 successfully complete our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT;\n\u2022 commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid, if approved, by developing a sales force or entering into collaborations with third parties;\n\u2022 realize the intended benefits of the collaboration and license arrangement with DSE; and\n\u2022 achieve market acceptance of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid in the medical community and with third-party payors.\nIn addition, we expect to incur significant sales and marketing costs as we prepare to commercialize the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid. Even if the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet and bempedoic acid are approved for commercial sale, and despite expending these costs, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid may not be commercially successful drugs. We may not achieve profitability soon after generating product sales, if ever. If we are unable to generate product revenue, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe may seek additional cash resources through a combination of collaborations with third parties, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, debt financings, royalty-based financings, private and public equity offerings or through other sources. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, your ownership interest in our company will be diluted. In addition, the terms of any such securities may include liquidation or\nother preferences that materially adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, would increase our fixed payment obligations. Debt or royalty-based financings may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements with third parties, such as the collaboration arrangement with DSE, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet or bempedoic acid, our intellectual property, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had United States federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $539.2 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $526.6 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an \"ownership change\" will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \"5-percent shareholders\" that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. As a result of prior equity issuances and other transactions in our stock, we have previously experienced \"ownership changes\" under section 382 of the Code and comparable state tax laws. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset United States federal and state taxable income is subject to limitations. The effect of the enactment of the TCJA was to reduce our corporate statutory income tax rate from 34% to 21%. This may cause a reduction in the economic benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets available to the Company.\nComplying with public company reporting and other obligations may strain our financial and managerial resources. Additionally, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, but we may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, either of which may harm investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as other rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ, which results in significant continuing legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses. The listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, and the related rules of the SEC that generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 requires an annual management assessment, as well as an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are in the costly and challenging process of evaluating and testing our internal controls for the purpose of providing the reports required by these rules. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the course of our review and testing, we may identify deficiencies and be unable to remediate them before we must provide the\nrequired reports. Furthermore, if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, we are required to timely file accurate quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, as amended. In order to report our results of operations and financial statements on an accurate and timely basis, we depend on CROs to provide timely and accurate notice of their costs to us. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from the NASDAQ Global Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Investment in our Common Stock\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAt December 31, 2018, our executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with certain of our directors beneficially owned approximately 11.4% of our outstanding voting common stock. These stockholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nWe may be at an increased risk of securities class action litigation.\nHistorically, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years.\nFor example, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in January 2016 naming us and certain of our officers as defendants. In December 2016, the federal district court granted our motion to dismiss with prejudice and entered judgment in our favor. In May 2017, the court denied plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend that judgment. On June 19, 2017, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and on September 14, 2017, they filed their opening brief in support of the appeal. The appeal was fully briefed on December 7, 2017, and it was argued before the Sixth Circuit on March 15, 2018. On September 27, 2018, the Sixth Circuit issued an opinion in which it reversed the district court's dismissal and remanded for further proceedings. On October 11, 2018, we filed a petition for rehearing en banc and, on October 23, 2018, the Sixth Circuit of Appeals directed plantiffs to respond to that petition. On December 3, 2018, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals denied our petition for en banc rehearing, and on December 11, 2018, the case was returned to the federal district court by mandate from the Sixth Circuit. On December 26, 2018, we filed our answer to the amended complaint.\nAdditionally, in December 2016, a purported derivative action was filed in Delaware against certain of our directors and officers. In February 2019, our company and defendants filed a motion to dismiss the derivative lawsuit. In May 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed naming us and certain of our officers as defendants. In November 2018, we filed a motion to dismiss and such motion was fully briefed in December 2018. In February 2019, the court granted our motion to dismiss with prejudice and entered judgment in our favor.\nAny lawsuit to which we or our directors or officers are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices. Any of these results could adversely affect our business. In addition, defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management. This proceeding and any others in which we may become involved could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports or publish misleading, inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We only recently started receiving research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the industry analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, or provides more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, even one that may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased them.", "PERMNO": 13954, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ESPR"}
