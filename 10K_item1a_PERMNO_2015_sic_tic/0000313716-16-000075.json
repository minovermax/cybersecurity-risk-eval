Risk Factors.\nRisk Factors That May Impact Future Results\nCurrent and potential shareholders should carefully consider the risks described below. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for shareholders to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and stock price.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nChanges in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.\nOur business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.\nThe following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in capacity at both original equipment manufacturers and job shops;\n\u2022\nThe availability of skilled machinists;\n\u2022\nThe need to replace machines that have reached the end of their useful life;\n\u2022\nThe need to replace older machines with new technology that increases productivity, reduces general manufacturing costs, and machines parts in a new way;\n\u2022\nThe evolution of end-use products requiring machining to more specific tolerances;\n\u2022\nOur customers' use of new materials requiring machining by different processes;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and manufacturing industry expansions and contractions; and\n\u2022\nChanges in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.\nOur business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.\nThe markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies. Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.\nThe greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions. Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage. If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline. There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets. While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.\nOur competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.\nThe machine tool industry is subject to technological change, rapidly evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings, especially with respect to computer-controlled products. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow. Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.\nWe manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world. In 2015, approximately 70% of our products were manufactured in countries outside of North America and approximately 66% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America. In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These factors include:\n\u2022\nA prolonged world-wide economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our principal international markets including Asia and Europe;\n\u2022\nChanges in political, regulatory, legal, or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nRestrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas, customs duties and tariffs, or trade barriers erected by either the United States or other countries where we do business;\n\u2022\nDisruptions of capital and trading markets;\n\u2022\nChanges in import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nTransportation delays;\n\u2022\nCivil disturbances or political instability;\n\u2022\nGeopolitical turmoil, including terrorism or war;\n\u2022\nCurrency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nChanges in labor standards;\n\u2022\nLimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nNationalization and expropriation; and\n\u2022\nChanges in domestic and foreign tax laws.\nPrices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.\nWe manufacture products with a relatively high iron casting or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate. The availability of, and prices for, these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages. In some cases, raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot. If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products. Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.\nSome components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers. Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates. Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely. The present economic environment could also pose the risk of one of these key suppliers going out of business, or cause delays in delivery times of critical components as business conditions rebound and demand increases.\nWe believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers. We support an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide. In 2015, approximately 30% of our sales were through distributors. No distributor accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2015. Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products. Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers. In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period. The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in less densely populated urban areas which, in many cases, may represent a relatively small market for skilled labor force. Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations. If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business. Failure to achieve these objectives would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in commitments of significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.\nWe face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects. We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to certain limitations under the applicable policies. We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability\ndefense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters. Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.\nWe believe, based upon information currently available that, except with respect to the environmental matter concerning the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site as described in Part I Item 1. \"Business - Environmental Matters\", we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation. Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.\nRisks Relating to Our Customers\nOur customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.\nFor many of our customers, the purchase of our machines represents a significant capital expenditure. For others, the purchase of our machines is a part of a larger improvement or expansion of manufacturing capability. For all, the purchase represents a long term commitment of capital raised by incurrence of debt, issuance of equity or use of cash flow from operations. Global economic and financial difficulties across the world in recent years have been well documented. Governments in Europe, Asia and the U.S. subsequently intervened in an effort to improve economic conditions. These interventions may have reduced the overall impact of the crisis, but also created instability, uncertainty and doubt. During this period, many of our customers experienced uncertain cash flows and reduced access to credit and equity markets, all of which made commitment to larger long term capital projects difficult. While global conditions appear to have improved, similar conditions in the future could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.\nWe generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments. Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture. Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us. For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs. The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly. Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, causing our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue. In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business. Order cancellations typically average approximately 2% of sales. Cancellations could vary significantly during times of global economic uncertainty.\nMajor changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.\nIn difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us. Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on customers' ability to pay. We run the risk of bad debt with customers on open account. If we write off\nsignificant parts of our customer accounts receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares. These include:\nStaggered Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of eight members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of two or three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms. This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.\nRemoval of Directors and Filling of Vacancies. Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors. Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from retirement, death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors. Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.\nSupermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations. Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.\nIn addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders. These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the Board of Directors has already designated 250,000 of such shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock) in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.\nOur shareholders may experience further dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.\nIn order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future offer, issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities. Our shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances. Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders.\nIn addition, we have filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing us to offer, from time to time and at any time, up to $100.0 million of equity securities (including common or preferred shares), subject to\nmarket conditions and other factors. The 1.0 million shares sold under the controlled equity offering are the only equity securities sold pursuant to such registration statement thus far. Accordingly, we may, from time to time and at any time, seek to offer and sell our equity securities, including sales of shares of common stock, based upon market conditions and other factors.\nThe announcement that our Board of Directors, together with our management team is exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur announcement that our Board of Directors, together with our management team is exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including, among other things, a possible sale, merger or other form of business combination or strategic transaction, could disrupt our business and create uncertainty about our prospects as a stand-alone entity. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of whether a strategic transaction is completed. These risks to our business include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of significant management time and resources towards the investigation or completion of a strategic transaction;\n\u2022\ndifficulties developing and maintaining relationships with customers and other business partners; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of our ability to attract and retain key personnel and other employees.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance whether or when any strategic transaction will be undertaken or thereafter consummated, and, even if a transaction is consummated, there can be no assurance as to whether or to what degree such a transaction will be successful in maximizing value to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 81620, "SIC": 3541, "TIC": "HDNG"}
