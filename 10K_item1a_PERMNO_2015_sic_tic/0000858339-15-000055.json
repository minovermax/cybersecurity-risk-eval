Risk Factors\nRisk Related to the CEC\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nDue to uncertainties relating to the Noteholder Disputes, there is substantial doubt regarding CEC\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs described more fully in Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d under the heading \u201cNoteholder Disputes,\u201d and in Note 22, \u201cSubsequent Events - Other,\u201d under the heading \u201cDemands for Payment,\u201d we are subject to currently pending or threatened litigation (the \u201cLitigation\u201d) and demands for payment by certain creditors asserting CEC is obligated under the former parent guarantee of certain CEOC defaulted debt (the \u201cDemands\u201d and, together with the Litigation, the \u201cNoteholder Disputes\u201d). The Litigation pending against CEOC, and in certain cases against CEC and its other subsidiaries, have been stayed due to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, however, certain Litigation and the Demands against CEC are continuing outside of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. We believe that the Litigation claims and Demands against CEC are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At the present time, we believe it is not probable that a material loss will result from the outcome of these matters. The Noteholder Disputes are in their very preliminary stages and discovery has begun on the Unsecured Note Lawsuits (as defined in Note 15, \u201cLitigation, Contractual Commitments, and Contingent Liabilities\u201d). We cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of the Noteholder Disputes or of the range of potential losses should the Noteholder Disputes ultimately be resolved against us, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the stage of the related litigation. Should these matters ultimately be resolved through litigation outside of the CEOC Financial Restructuring, and were a court to find in favor of the claimants in any of these Noteholder Disputes, such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Accordingly, we have concluded that the material uncertainty related to certain of the Litigation proceeding against CEC raises substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to the Bankruptcy Proceedings\nCEOC and a substantial majority of its wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings.\nAs a result of CEOC\u2019s highly-leveraged capital structure and the general decline in its gaming results since 2007, on January 15, 2015, CEOC and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cDebtors\u201d) voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. Because CEOC is under the control of the Bankruptcy Court, CEC deconsolidated this subsidiary effective January 15, 2015 (see Note 23, \u201cSubsequent Events - CEOC Bankruptcy and Deconsolidation\u201d).\nWe are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 proceedings, which may lead to potential adverse effects on our liquidity, results of operations, or business prospects. We cannot assure you of the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings. Risks associated with the Chapter 11 proceedings include the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Debtors to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Debtors to obtain bankruptcy court approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 proceedings and the outcomes of bankruptcy court rulings of the proceedings in general;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with involuntary bankruptcy proceedings filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and now pending in the Bankruptcy Court;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Debtors to comply with and to operate under the cash collateral order and any cash management orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe length of time the Debtors will operate under the Chapter 11 proceedings and their ability to successfully emerge, including with respect to obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Debtors to negotiate, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nthe likelihood of Caesars Entertainment losing control over the operation of the Debtors as a result of the restructuring process;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third party motions, proceedings and litigation in the Chapter 11 proceedings, which may interfere with the Debtors\u2019 plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nincreased costs related to the bankruptcy filing and other litigation;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage contracts that are critical to our operation, and to obtain and maintain appropriate credit and other terms with customers, suppliers and service providers;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan;\n\u2022\nwhether our non-Debtor subsidiaries continue to operate their business in the normal course;\n\u2022\nthe disposition or resolution of all pre-petition claims against us and the Debtors; and\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain existing customers and vendor relationships and expand sales to new customers.\nThe Chapter 11 proceedings may disrupt our business and may materially and adversely affect our operations.\nWe have attempted to minimize the adverse effect of the Debtors\u2019 Chapter 11 proceedings on our relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and other parties. Nonetheless, our relationships with our customers, suppliers, and employees may be adversely impacted by negative publicity or otherwise and our operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Chapter 11 proceedings could negatively affect our ability to attract new employees and retain existing high performing employees or executives, which could materially and adversely affect our operations.\nThe Chapter 11 proceedings limit the flexibility of our management team in running the Debtors\u2019 business.\nWhile the Debtors\u2019 operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Court approval is required with respect to the Debtors\u2019 business, and in some cases certain holders of claims in respect of claims under CEOC\u2019s first lien notes and other indebtedness (\u201cConsenting Creditors\u201d) who have entered into a Third Amended and Restated Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement, dated as of January 14, 2015 (the \u201cRSA\u201d) with us and CEOC, prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court, negotiation with various parties-in-interest, including any statutory committees appointed in the Chapter 11 proceedings, and one or more hearings. Such committees and parties-in-interest may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions. This process could delay major transactions and limit the Debtors ability to respond quickly to opportunities and events in the marketplace. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, the Debtors could be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that they believe are beneficial to them.\nAdditionally, the terms of the interim cash collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy Court will limit the Debtors\u2019 ability to undertake certain business initiatives. These limitations may include, among other things, the Debtors\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nsell assets outside the normal course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Debtors\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\ngrant liens;\n\u2022\nincur debt for borrowed money outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nprepay prepetition obligations; and\n\u2022\nfinance the Debtors\u2019 operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in the Debtors\u2019 interests.\nThe RSA is subject to significant conditions and milestones which may be difficult for us to satisfy.\nWe, CEOC and the Consenting Creditors entered into the RSA, pursuant to which, among other things, CEOC agreed to file a plan of reorganization in accordance with the terms of the RSA (the \u201cPlan\u201d). While the Consenting Creditors have agreed to vote in favor of the Plan when properly solicited to do so, there are certain material conditions CEOC must satisfy under the RSA, including the timely satisfaction of milestones in the Chapter 11 proceedings such as obtaining orders from the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the use of cash collateral, approval of the disclosure statement and confirmation of the Plan. The Debtors\u2019 ability to timely complete such milestones is subject to risks and uncertainties that may be beyond our control. If the Consenting Creditors are not required to vote for the Plan, the Plan may not be confirmed, in which case the Debtors would need to develop an alternative plan of reorganization.\nThe Debtors may not be able to obtain Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan or may have to modify the terms of the Plan.\nEven if approved by each class of holders of claims and interests entitled to vote (a \u201cVoting Class\u201d), the Bankruptcy Court may, as a court of equity, exercise substantial discretion and could choose not to confirm the Plan. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129 requires, among other things, a showing that confirmation of the Plan will not be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization for the Debtors, and that the value of distributions to dissenting holders of claims and interests will not be less than the value such holders would receive if the Debtors liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Although we believe that the Plan will satisfy such tests, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion.\nConfirmation of the Plan will also be subject to certain conditions. These conditions may not be met, and there can be no assurance that we and a requisite amount of the Consenting Creditors under the RSA will agree to modify or waive such conditions. Further, changed circumstances may necessitate changes to the Plan. Any such modifications could result in less favorable treatment of any non-accepting class, as well as any classes junior to such non-accepting class, than the treatment that will currently be provided in the Plan in accordance with the RSA. Such less favorable treatment could include a distribution of property (including new securities) to the class affected by the modification of a lesser value than what the RSA contemplates will be provided in the Plan or no distribution of property whatsoever under the Plan. In addition, any changes to the Plan, including any changes that would result in Caesars Entertainment no longer controlling the operations of CEOC, could have an adverse effect on Caesars Entertainment and its remaining operations. Changes to the Plan may also delay the confirmation of the Plan and the Debtors\u2019 emergence from bankruptcy.\nIf the Plan is confirmed, Caesars Entertainment will be required to invest and pay significant amounts of cash in connection with the restructuring of CEOC, which may have a negative impact on Caesars Entertainment\u2019s business and operating condition.\nIf the Bankruptcy Court approves the Plan, in connection with the Debtors\u2019 emergence from Chapter 11, Caesars Entertainment will be required to (i) contribute over $400 million to pay a forbearance fee, for general corporate purposes and to fund sources and uses and (ii) purchase up to approximately $1.0 billion of new equity in the restructured Debtors. As a result of these payments and investments, Caesars Entertainment may have less cash available in future periods for investments and operating expenses and, as a result, the confirmation of the Plan and emergence of the Debtors may have a negative impact on Caesars Entertainment\u2019s business and operating conditions.\nIf the Plan is confirmed, Caesars Entertainment will be required to guarantee the lease payments owed by the restructured operating company to the restructured property companies and, if the restructured operating company is unable to or does not pay amounts due under the leases, Caesars Entertainment will be obligated to pay the full amount.\nIf the Bankruptcy Court approves the Plan, in connection with the Debtors\u2019 emergence from Chapter 11, Caesars Entertainment will guarantee the two leases between the restructured operating company (\u201cOpCo\u201d) and the restructured property companies (\u201cCPLV PropCo\u201d and \"Non-CPLV PropCo\", collectively \"PropCo\"), under which CPLV PropCo and Non-CPLV PropCo will lease properties to OpCo: (1) for the Caesars Palace Las Vegas (\u201cCPLV\u201d) property (the \u201cCPLV Lease\u201d) and (2) for certain properties currently owned by CEOC other than CPLV (the \u201cNon-CPLV PropCo Lease\u201d and, together with the CPLV Lease, the \u201cLeases\u201d). Under the terms of a proposed management lease support agreement, Caesars Entertainment will guarantee the payment and performance of all monetary obligations of OpCo under the Leases. If OpCo is unable to meet its monetary obligations under the Leases, Caesars Entertainment may be subject to significant obligations, which would have a negative impact on Caesars Entertainment\u2019s business and operating conditions.\nThe merger with CAC is subject to various closing conditions, including governmental approvals, and other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\nOn December 21, 2014, Caesars Entertainment entered into the Merger Agreement with CAC, under which CAC will merge with and into Caesars Entertainment, with Caesars Entertainment continuing as the surviving corporation. The consummation of the merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, many of which are not within Caesars Entertainment\u2019s control, and failure to satisfy such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the transaction. These conditions include, among other things, (a) obtaining any necessary licenses, consents or other approvals, including from gaming authorities, to effect the merger, (b) the Plan having been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, (c) minimum cash conditions for each of (i) CGP LLC and its subsidiaries and (ii) Caesars Entertainment and CERP, (d) receipt of certain tax opinions or rulings regarding certain tax aspects of the restructuring of CEOC and (e) a threshold amount of tax costs to Caesars Entertainment related to certain aspects of the restructuring of CEOC. It also is possible that a change, event, fact, effect or circumstance that could lead to a material adverse effect on Caesars Entertainment may occur, which may result in CAC not being obligated to complete the merger. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if an uncertainty resulting in a material adverse effect on Caesars Entertainment may arise. If the merger does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if another event occurs delaying or preventing the merger, such delay or failure to complete the merger may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect Caesars Entertainment\u2019s business, financial performance and operating results and the price per share for Caesar Entertainment\u2019s common stock.\nIn the event that the pending merger with CAC is not completed, the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results may be negatively impacted.\nAs noted above, the conditions to the completion of the merger with CAC may not be satisfied, and even if the Plan is confirmed, under certain circumstances the exchange ratio between shares of CAC Class A common stock and CEC common stock may be adjusted or the merger agreement may be terminated. If the merger with CAC is not completed for any reason, we would still be liable for significant transaction costs and the focus of our management would have been diverted from seeking other potential opportunities without realizing any benefits of the completed merger. If we do not complete the merger, certain litigation against us will remain outstanding and not be released. If we do not complete the merger, the price of our common stock may decline significantly from the current market price, which may reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed.\nCEOC may have insufficient liquidity for its business operations during the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nAlthough we believe that CEOC will have sufficient liquidity to operate its businesses during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings, there can be no assurance that the revenue generated by CEOC\u2019s business operations and cash made available to CEOC under the cash collateral order or otherwise in its restructuring process will be sufficient to fund its operations, especially as we expect CEOC to incur substantial professional and other fees related to its restructuring. CEOC has not made arrangements for financing in the form of a debtor-in-possession credit facility, or DIP facility. In the event that revenue flows and other available cash are not sufficient to meet CEOC\u2019s liquidity requirements, CEOC may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on terms that are acceptable. If, for one or more reasons, CEOC is unable to obtain such additional financing, CEOC could be required to seek a sale of the company or certain of its material assets or its businesses and assets may be subject to liquidation under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and CEOC may cease to continue as a going concern.\nAny plan of reorganization that the Debtors may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by CEOC. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, the Debtors\u2019 plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nAny plan of reorganization that the Debtors may implement could affect both the Debtors\u2019 capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of the Debtors\u2019 businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on CEOC\u2019s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that CEOC considers appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with CEOC\u2019s expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) CEOC\u2019s ability to substantially change the Debtors\u2019 capital structure; (ii) CEOC\u2019s ability to restructure the Debtors as a separate operating company and property company, with a real estate investment trust directly or indirectly owning and controlling the property company, (iii) the ability of the Debtors to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iv) our ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (v) the Debtors\u2019 ability to retain key employees; and (vi) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of the Debtors\u2019 businesses.\nIn addition, any plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), capital expenditures, debt service, and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. The forecasts for the Debtors will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of the Debtors\u2019 capital structure and corporate structure. Accordingly, CEOC expects that its actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what CEOC has anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization implemented by the Debtors will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on the Debtors and their subsidiaries or businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure and our corporate structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. As of the Petition Date, CEOC was deconsolidated from our financial statements. Consequently, our results of operations following the deconsolidation will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur substantial indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of our cash flow is used to make interest payments could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments.\nWe are a highly-leveraged company, primarily resulting from the leverage of CEOC. We had $25.6 billion in consolidated face value of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014, including $18.4 billion outstanding at CEOC, $4.8 billion outstanding at CERP, and $2.4 billion outstanding at CGP LLC. As of December 31, 2014, our consolidated estimated debt service obligation for 2015 is $18.8 billion, consisting of $18.0 billion in principal maturities and $764 million in required interest payments. Of those totals, CEOC\u2019s estimated debt service obligation for 2015 is $18.2 billion, consisting of $18.0 billion in principal maturities and $184 million in required interest payments.\nOur substantial indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing such indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, debt service requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and repayment of our indebtedness thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\u2022\nmake us more highly-leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, developing new gaming facilities, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\naffect our ability to renew gaming and other licenses;\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets; and\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations.\nThere is substantial doubt regarding CEOC\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe do not currently expect that CEOC\u2019s cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay its indebtedness and, accordingly, CEOC has sought a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. CEOC\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, its ability to: (i) develop and successfully implement a restructuring plan within the timeframe of the RSA, (ii) comply with the covenants contained in the cash collateral order, including compliance with the approved budget, and in any post-restructuring financing, (iii) reduce debt and other liabilities through the restructuring process, (iv) return to profitability, (v) generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and (vi) obtain financing sources to meet its future obligations. CEOC\u2019s restructuring plan could result in the separation of its business into a separate operating company and a REIT, with the REIT owning substantially all of its real estate assets. We believe the consummation of a successful restructuring is critical to CEOC\u2019s continued viability and long-term liquidity. While CEOC is working towards achieving these objectives, there can be no certainty that it will be successful in doing so, and we cannot guarantee that its success or failure will not have an impact on our business.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or unable to draw under our senior secured credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. Our operating cash inflows are typically used for operating expenses, debt service costs, working capital needs, and capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Our operating cash flows are consumed by our cash interest payments, which totaled $2.1 billion in 2014. We experienced negative operating cash flows of $735 million in 2014, and we also expect to experience negative operating cash flows in 2015.\nWe may incur significantly more debt, which could adversely affect our ability to pursue certain opportunities.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness at any time, and from time to time, including in the near future. Although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nFor example, as of December 31, 2014, CERP had $90 million of additional borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit facility. CGP LLC had $150 million of additional borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit facility. None of our existing indebtedness limits the amount of debt that may be incurred by Caesars Entertainment.\nOur subsidiary debt agreements allow for one or more future issuances of additional secured notes or loans, which may include, in each case, indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the obligations under CGP LLC or CERP's credit facilities and first lien notes. This indebtedness could be used for a variety of purposes, including financing capital expenditures, refinancing or repurchasing our outstanding indebtedness, including existing unsecured indebtedness, or for general corporate purposes. We have raised and expect to continue to raise debt, including secured debt, to directly or indirectly refinance our outstanding unsecured debt on an opportunistic basis, as well as development and acquisition opportunities.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on the issuer of the debt\u2019s ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nWe have pledged and will pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements. If any of our lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness.\nWe are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios under our debt agreements. See Note 10, \"Debt,\" for further information. Our ability to meet the financial ratios under our debt agreements can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to meet those ratios.\nA failure to comply with the covenants contained in our indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facilities or the existing agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under the indebtedness of CERP or CGP LLC, the lenders thereunder:\n\u2022\nwill not be required to lend any additional amounts to such borrowers;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or\n\u2022\nrequire such borrowers to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.\nSuch actions by the lenders under CERP\u2019s or CGP LLC\u2019s indebtedness could cause cross defaults under the other indebtedness of CERP and CGP LLC, respectively. For instance, if CERP were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under CERP\u2019s credit facilities and the holders of CERP\u2019s secured notes could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nIf the indebtedness under CERP\u2019s or CGP LLC\u2019s credit facilities, or other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that their assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nRepayment of our subsidiaries\u2019 debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries currently own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our other subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our other subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nDuring the second half of 2014, CAC, CGP LLC, Caesars Entertainment, CEOC and CERP received letters from unnamed parties who purport to hold debt issued by CEOC objecting to various transactions undertaken by CEOC and its affiliated entities in 2013 and 2014. In addition, as described in Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings,\" Caesars Entertainment and CEOC were served with the Second Lien Lawsuit, the Unsecured Note Lawsuits, and the First Lien Lawsuit; Caesars Entertainment and CAC were served with the Merger Lawsuit; and Caesars Entertainment was sued in the BOKF Lawsuit. CEOC has also received purported notices of default with respect to certain of its outstanding indebtedness. Although these proceedings pending against CEOC, and in certain cases against CEC and its subsidiaries, have been stayed due to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, certain litigation and demands against CEC are continuing outside the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. If a court were to find in favor of the claimants in any of these disputes, such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and on the ability of lenders and noteholders to recover on claims under our indebtedness.\nAs well, from time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners, Indian tribes and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all legal proceedings, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and in general, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. For example, we may have potential liability arising from a class action lawsuit against Hilton Hotels Corporation relating to employee benefit obligations. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe leadership of our chief executive officer and other executive officers has been a critical element of our success. Our chief executive officer is in the process of transitioning his role to a new chief executive officer. Any unforeseen loss of a chief executive officer\u2019s services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. Our other executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our businesses that we believe will make significant contributions to our growth and success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could also adversely affect us. We do not have key man or similar life insurance policies covering members of our senior management. We have employment agreements with our executive officers, but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us, and there can be no assurance that any such officers will remain with us.\nIf we cannot attract, retain and motivate employees, we may be unable to compete effectively, and lose the ability to improve and expand our businesses.\nOur success and ability to grow depend, in part, on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and expand our business, in many locations around the world. We face intense competition for highly qualified, specialized technical, managerial, and consulting personnel. Recruiting, training, retention and benefit costs place significant demands on our resources. Additionally, our substantial indebtedness and the recent downturn in the gaming, travel and leisure sectors have made recruiting executives to our businesses more difficult, which may become even more difficult as a result of the Debtors\u2019 Chapter 11 proceedings. The inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe may sell or divest different properties or assets as a result of our evaluation of our portfolio of businesses. Such sales or divestitures could affect our costs, revenues, profitability and financial position.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate our properties and our portfolio of businesses and may, as a result, sell or attempt to sell, divest or spin-off different properties or assets. For example, in June 2014 and August 2014, we closed Harrah\u2019s Tunica and Showboat Atlantic City, respectively. In addition, in May 2014, CGP LLC (or one or more of its designated direct or indirect subsidiaries) acquired from CEOC (or one or more of its affiliates) The Cromwell (f/k/a Bill\u2019s Gamblin\u2019 Hall & Saloon), The LINQ Hotel & Casino (f/k/a The Quad Resort & Casino), Bally\u2019s Las Vegas and Harrah\u2019s New Orleans as well as a financial stake in the management fee stream for all of those properties.\nThese sales or divestitures affect our costs, revenues, profitability, financial position, liquidity and our ability to comply with our debt covenants. Divestitures have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions (including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals), the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses, and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. In addition, current economic conditions and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts. Expected costs savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested properties, may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to our fixed cost structure.\nReduction in discretionary consumer spending resulting from the downturn in the national economy over the past few years, the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, adverse changes in the global economy and other factors could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to access financing.\nChanges in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences are driven by factors beyond our control, such as perceived or actual general economic conditions; high energy, fuel and other commodity costs; the cost of travel; the potential for bank failures; a soft job market; an actual or perceived decrease in disposable consumer income and wealth; the recent increase in payroll taxes; increases in gaming taxes or fees; fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy; and terrorist attacks or other global events. Our business is particularly susceptible to any such changes because our casino properties offer a highly discretionary set of entertainment and leisure activities and amenities. Gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures and participation in such activities may decline if discretionary consumer spending declines, including during economic downturns, during which consumers generally earn less disposable income. The economic downturn that began in 2008 and adverse conditions in the local, regional, national and global markets have negatively affected our business and results of operations and may continue to negatively affect our operations in the future. In addition, the Atlantic City gaming market in particular has seen a massive decline. For example, according to the UNLV Center for Gaming Research, reported gaming revenues for Atlantic City properties have declined from $5.2 billion in 2006 to $2.7 billion in 2014. During periods of economic contraction, our revenues may decrease while most of our costs remain fixed and some costs even increase, resulting in decreased earnings. While economic conditions have improved, our revenues may continue to decrease. For example, while the gaming industry has partially recovered from 2006, there are no assurances that the gaming industry will continue to grow as a result of economic downturn or other factors. Any decrease in the gaming industry could adversely affect consumer spending and adversely affect our operations.\nAdditionally, key determinants of our revenues and operating performance include hotel average daily rate (\"ADR\"), number of gaming trips and average spend per trip by our customers. Given that 2007 was the peak year for our financial performance and the gaming industry in the United States in general, we may not attain those financial levels in the near term, or at all. If we fail to increase ADR or any other similar metric in the near term, our revenues may not increase and, as a result, we may not be able to pay down our existing debt, fund our operations, fund planned capital expenditures or achieve expected growth rates, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending in our gaming operations and related facilities, as consumers spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn. Furthermore, other uncertainties, including national and global economic conditions, terrorist attacks or other global events, could adversely affect consumer spending and adversely affect our operations.\nGrowth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings could negatively impact our gaming revenue.\nAlthough recent trends have indicated a growing shift in customer demand for gambling over non-gaming offerings when visiting Las Vegas, there are no assurances that this trend will continue and that demand for non-gaming offerings will not increase. According to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, 41% of Las Vegas visitors in 2013 indicated that their primary reason to visit was for vacation or pleasure as opposed to solely for gambling as the main attraction, up from 39% of visitors in 2008 but down from 51% of visitors in 2010. To the extent the demand for non-gaming offerings replaces demand for gambling, our gaming revenues will decrease, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not realize any or all of our projected cost savings, which would have a negative effect on our financial performance and negatively impact our covenant calculation and could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nWe have undertaken comprehensive cost-reduction efforts to manage expenses with current business levels. While these and other identified new cost saving programs have allowed us and we expect will allow us to realize substantial savings, our continued reduction efforts may fail to achieve similar or continued savings. Although we believe, as of December 31, 2014, once fully implemented, these cost savings programs will produce additional estimated annual cost savings of $220 million (of which $180 million relates to CEOC), we may not realize some or all of these projected savings without impacting our revenues. Our cost savings plans are intended to increase our effectiveness and efficiency in our operations without impacting our revenues and margins and we from time to time implement cost savings plans to help us meet the requirements of our debt agreements. Our cost savings plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual savings may differ materially from what we anticipate. For example, cutting advertising or marketing expenses may have an unintended negative affect on our revenues. In addition, our expected savings from procurement of goods may be affected by unexpected increases in the cost of raw materials.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies, the enforcement of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive gaming regulations and political and regulatory uncertainty. Regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, revenues and income from operations were negatively impacted during July 2006 in Atlantic City by a three-day government-imposed casino shutdown. Furthermore, in many jurisdictions where we operate, licenses are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. For example, in Iowa, our ability to continue our gaming operations is subject to a referendum every eight years or at any time upon petition of the voters in the county in which we operate; the most recent referendum which approved our ability to continue to operate our casinos occurred in November 2010. In Maryland, we will have to reapply for our license in July 2017. There can be no assurance that continued gaming activity will be approved in any referendum in the future. If we do not obtain the requisite approval in any future referendum, we will not be able to operate our gaming operations in Iowa, which would negatively impact our future performance.\nFrom time to time, individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums, such as bans on smoking in casinos and other entertainment and dining facilities, which could adversely impact our operations. For example, the City Council of Atlantic City passed an ordinance in 2007 requiring that we segregate at least 75% of the casino gaming floor as a nonsmoking area, leaving no more than 25% of the casino gaming floor as a smoking area. Illinois also passed the Smoke Free Illinois Act which became effective January 1, 2008, and bans smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants, work places, schools and casinos. The Smoke Free Illinois Act also bans smoking within 15 feet of any entrance, window or air intake area of these public places. In January 2015, the City of New Orleans passed a ban on indoor smoking and use of electronic cigarettes, which will become effective on May 1, 2015. These smoking bans have adversely affected revenues and operating results at our properties. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.\nFurthermore, because we are subject to regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review our compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions, it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that existing or future jurisdictions would not raise similar questions with respect to our suitability arising out of the Bureau\u2019s report, or with respect to matters that may arise in the future, and we cannot assure you that such issues will not adversely affect us or our financial condition.\nOur stockholders are subject to extensive governmental regulation and if a stockholder is found unsuitable by the gaming authority, that stockholder would not be able to beneficially own our common stock directly or indirectly.\nIn many jurisdictions, gaming laws can require any of our stockholders to file an application, be investigated, and qualify or have his, her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable. Subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved, for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities. For additional information on the criteria used in making determinations regarding suitability, see \"Governmental Regulation.\"\nFor example, under Nevada gaming laws, each person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of any voting security, or beneficial or record ownership of any non-voting security or any debt security, in a public corporation which is registered with the Nevada Gaming Commission, or the Gaming Commission, may be required to be found suitable if the Gaming Commission has reason to believe that his or her acquisition of that ownership, or his or her continued ownership in general, would be inconsistent with the declared public policy of Nevada, in the sole discretion of the Gaming Commission. Any person required by the Gaming Commission to be found suitable shall apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Gaming Commission's request that he or she should do so and, together with his or her application for suitability, deposit with the Nevada Gaming Control Board, or the Control Board, a sum of money which, in the sole discretion of the Control Board, will be adequate to pay the anticipated costs and charges incurred in the investigation and processing of that application for suitability, and deposit such additional sums as are required by the Control Board to pay final costs and charges. Additionally, under Ohio law, an institutional investor, which is broadly defined and includes any corporation that holds any amount of our stock, will be required to apply for and obtain a waiver of suitability determination.\nFurthermore, any person required by a gaming authority to be found suitable, who is found unsuitable by the gaming authority, may not hold directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any voting security or the beneficial or record ownership of any nonvoting security or any debt security of any public corporation which is registered with the gaming authority beyond the time prescribed by the gaming authority. A violation of the foregoing may constitute a criminal offense. A finding of unsuitability by a particular gaming authority impacts that person's ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in that particular jurisdiction and could impact the person's ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in other jurisdictions.\nMany jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming authorities, and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for \"institutional investors\" that hold a company's voting securities for investment purposes only. Under Maryland gaming laws, we may not sell or otherwise transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore without the approval of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission, or the Maryland Commission, after the Maryland Commission determines that the transferee is qualified or grants the transferee an institutional investor waiver.\nSome jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest. In Indiana, for example, a person may not have an ownership interest in more than two Indiana riverboat owner's licenses, and in Maryland an individual or business entity may not own an interest in more than one video lottery facility.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors, our profits will decline.\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive and our competitors vary considerably in size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, and geographic diversity. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, and with various other entertainment businesses. Our competitors in each market that we participate may have greater financial, marketing, or other resources than we do, and there can be no assurance that they will not engage in aggressive pricing action to compete with us. Although we believe we are currently able to compete effectively in each of the various markets in which we participate, we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to do so or that we will be capable of maintaining or further increasing our current market share. Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nIn recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those markets. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets, including Las Vegas, our largest market, and competition has increased significantly. For example, CityCenter, a large development of resorts and residences, opened in December 2009, SLS Las Vegas opened in August 2014, and the Genting Group has announced plans to develop a casino called Resorts World Las Vegas, which is expected to open in 2017. Also, in response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. MGM has announced plans for The Park, which includes a new retail and dining development on the land between New York-New York and Monte Carlo, a renovation of the Strip-front facades of both resorts and a new 20,000 seat indoor arena for sporting events and concerts operated by AEG. Construction of The Park and the arena is expected to be complete in 2016. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers, however, there are no details as to when or if these projects will be completed. The expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance in certain markets, including Atlantic City.\nIn particular, our business may be adversely impacted by the additional gaming and room capacity in Nevada. In addition, our operations located in New Jersey may be adversely impacted by the expansion of gaming in Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania, and our operations located in Nevada may be adversely impacted by the expansion of gaming in California.\nTheoretical win rates for our casino operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of game, on average, will win or lose in the long run. In addition to the element of chance, theoretical win rates are also affected by the spread of table limits and factors that are beyond our control, such as a player's skill and experience and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time players spend gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates at the casino may differ from theoretical win rates and could result in the winnings of our gaming customers exceeding those anticipated. The variability of these factors, alone or in combination, have the potential to negatively impact our actual win rates, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face the risk of fraud and cheating.\nOur gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUse of the \"Caesars\" brand name, or any of our other brands, by entities other than us could damage the brands and our operations and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe \"Caesars\" brand remains the most recognized casino brand in the world and our operations benefit from the global recognition and reputation generated by our brands. Generally, we are actively pursuing gaming and non-gaming management, branding, and development opportunities in Asia and other parts of the world where our brands and reputation are already well-recognized assets. In addition, we will continue to expand our World Series of Poker tournaments to international jurisdictions where we believe there is a likelihood of legalization of online gaming, in order to grow the brand\u2019s awareness. In connection with such opportunities, we intend to grant third parties licenses to use our brands. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the management or the enforcement of the \"Caesars\" and the \"World Series of Poker\" brand names, or any of our other brands, by third parties outside of our exclusive control.\nAny failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.\nThe development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and use information that we regard as proprietary and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and our market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe extend credit to a portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players.\nWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis at many of our properties. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. Table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. While gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \"marker,\" and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis and judgments in such jurisdictions on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nThe acquisition, development and construction of new hotels, casinos and gaming and non-gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations due to various factors including delays, cost overruns and other uncertainties.\nWe intend to develop, construct and open or acquire new hotels, casinos and other gaming venues, and develop and manage non-gaming venues, in response to opportunities that may arise. Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third party debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, which could have an adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The development and construction of new hotels, casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones, such as the redevelopment of The Cromwell in Las Vegas, the development and construction of Horseshoe Baltimore, and the redevelopment of The LINQ Hotel & Casino, are susceptible to various risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u2022\nthe existence of acceptable market conditions and demand for the completed project;\n\u2022\ngeneral construction risks, including cost overruns, change orders and plan or specification modification, shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor, labor disputes, unforeseen environmental, engineering or geological problems, work stoppages, fire and other natural disasters, construction scheduling problems, and weather interferences;\n\u2022\nchanges and concessions required by governmental or regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe ability to finance the projects, especially in light of our substantial indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining, or inability to obtain, all licenses, permits and authorizations required to complete and/or operate the project; and\n\u2022\ndisruption of our existing operations and facilities.\nMoreover, our development and expansion projects are sometimes jointly pursued with third parties or by licensing our brands to third parties. These joint development, expansion projects or license agreements are subject to risks, in addition to those disclosed above, as they are dependent on our ability to reach and maintain agreements with third parties.\nOur failure to complete any new development or expansion project, or consummate any joint development, expansion projects or projects where we license our brands, as planned, on schedule, within budget or in a manner that generates anticipated profits, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of current or potential future acquisitions.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the businesses of such acquired company with our businesses. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies, and may not result in the full benefits expected. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\ncoordinating marketing functions;\n\u2022\nundisclosed liabilities; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022\nretaining key employees;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations.\nWe may be unable to realize in whole or in part the benefits anticipated for any current or future acquisitions.\nThe risks associated with our international operations could reduce our profits.\nSome of our properties are located outside the United States, our acquisitions of London Clubs in 2006 and Playtika in 2011 have increased the percentage of our revenue derived from operations outside the United States. International operations are subject to inherent risks including:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nvariation in local economies;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuation;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers; and\n\u2022\nburden of complying with a variety of international laws.\nFor example, the political instability in Egypt due to the uprising in January 2011 has negatively affected our properties there.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar laws and regulations could have a negative impact on us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing business cross-border and in each of the countries in which it transacts business. We are subject to requirements imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their affiliates from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. Policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws (\u201cAML\u201d) or regulations, on which in recent years, governmental authorities have been increasingly focused, with a particular focus on the gaming industry, by any of our resorts could have a negative effect on our results of operations. As an example, a major gaming company recently settled a U.S. Attorney investigation into its AML practices. In October 2013, one of our subsidiaries received a letter from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of the Treasury (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), stating that FinCEN is investigating one of our subsidiaries, Desert Palace, Inc. (the owner of Caesars Palace), for alleged violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) based on a BSA examination of Caesars Palace previously conducted by the Internal Revenue Service to determine whether it is appropriate to assess a civil penalty and/or take additional enforcement action against Caesars Palace. We responded to FinCEN\u2019s letter in January 2014. Additionally, there is an ongoing federal grand jury investigation regarding AML matters. We are cooperating fully with both the FinCEN and grand jury investigations. Based on proceedings to date, we are currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of these matters or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any.\nActs of terrorism, war, natural disasters, severe weather and political, economic and military conditions may impede our ability to operate or may negatively impact our financial results.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties. For example, a substantial number of the customers of our properties in Las Vegas use air travel. As a result of terrorist acts that occurred on September 11, 2001, domestic and international travel was severely disrupted, which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to our properties in Las Vegas. We cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, security alerts or war, uprisings, or hostilities in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan and/or Syria or other countries throughout the world will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results. For example, our operations in Cairo, Egypt were negatively affected from the uprising there in January 2011. As a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, natural and man-made disasters such as major fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and oil spills could also adversely impact our business and operating results. Such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely impacted. Harrah's Atlantic City was closed during a busy summer weekend in August 2011 due to Hurricane Irene and was closed for five days in October and November 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy. Our results of operations were significantly impacted by the closure due to Hurricane Sandy. In addition, Hurricane Sandy substantially impacted tourism in New Jersey, including Atlantic City, and the level of tourism has not yet recovered.\nIn most cases, we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, is out of our control. In some cases, however, we may receive no proceeds from insurance, such as our August 2011 closing and October and November 2012 closings in Atlantic City.\nAdditionally, a natural disaster affecting one or more of our properties may affect the level and cost of insurance coverage we may be able to obtain in the future, which may adversely affect our financial position.\nAs our operations depend in part on our customers' ability to travel, severe or inclement weather can also have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets, which could negatively affect our future profits.\nWe perform our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of EBITDA and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. We also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. Both EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value and buy or sell businesses in our industry.\nWe will also perform an annual impairment assessment of other non-amortizing intangible assets as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We determine the estimated fair value of our non-amortizing intangible assets by primarily using the Relief From Royalty Method and Excess Earnings Method under the income approach.\nWe review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. When performing this assessment, we consider current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic, legal, and regulatory factors.\nWe are dependent upon our properties for future cash flows and our continued success depends on our ability to draw customers to our properties. Significant negative industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business have resulted in impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges may be required in future periods. If we are required to record additional impairment charges, this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may be required to pay our future tax obligation on our deferred cancellation of debt income.\nUnder the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or the ARRA, we received temporary federal tax relief under the Delayed Recognition of Cancellation of Debt Income, or CODI, rules. The ARRA contains a provision that allows for a deferral for tax purposes of CODI for debt reacquired in 2009 and 2010, followed by recognition of CODI ratably from 2014 through 2018. In connection with the debt that we reacquired in 2009 and 2010, we have deferred related CODI of $3.5 billion for tax purposes (net of Original Issue Discount (\"OID\") interest expense, some of which must also be deferred to 2014 through 2018 under the ARRA). We are required to include one-fifth of the deferred CODI, net of deferred and regularly scheduled OID, in taxable income each year from 2014 through 2018. Alternatively, the deferred CODI, net of deferred OID, could be accelerated into taxable income in a year an impairment transaction occurs. To the extent that our federal taxable income exceeds our available federal net operating loss carry forwards in those years, we will have a cash tax obligation.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices which affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues. We may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change directed at up-stream utility providers, as we could experience potentially higher utility, fuel, and transportation costs.\nCGP LLC\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests.\nThe interests of CGP LLC could conflict with our interests. CGP LLC is in a similar business to us and is required to first provide any potential development opportunities to us. However, we may decide to decline the opportunity for the Company\u2019s business and permit CGP LLC to pursue the development opportunity. A committee of our board of directors comprised of disinterested directors will consider potential development opportunities provided to us by CGP LLC. If the committee declines an opportunity, that opportunity will be available to CGP LLC and will not be available to our businesses. As a result, our business and growth prospects could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the consideration of business opportunities may create potential or perceived conflicts of interests between our and CGP LLC's businesses. While we may retain a portion of the financial stake in any management fee to be received in connection with an opportunity provided to CGP LLC, there can be no assurances that such opportunity will be successful or that we will receive the expected fees from any opportunity.\nAlthough certain employees of affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with such affiliates, \"Apollo\") and affiliates of TPG Capital, LP (together with such affiliates, \"TPG\" and, together with Apollo, the \"Sponsors\") are on the boards of directors of Caesars Entertainment and CAC, the certificates of incorporation of both companies provide that neither the Sponsors nor directors have any obligation to present any corporate opportunity to Caesars Entertainment or CAC. Accordingly, the Sponsors may pursue gaming, entertainment or other activities outside of Caesars Entertainment or CAC and have no obligation to present such opportunity to Caesars Entertainment or CAC.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions. The collective bargaining agreements covering most of our Las Vegas union employees expired on May 31, 2013. A new five-year agreement was finalized in January 2014, which includes a no strike provision for the term of the contract. Based on the contract recently agreed upon covering the other Caesars\u2019 Las Vegas properties, we are hopeful that The LINQ Hotel & Casino negotiations produce a new agreement without any work disruptions. However, the possibility of a work stoppage or disruption is always present in such circumstances. Such labor dispute, if it occurred, could have a material impact on our operations.\nLater this year, several collective bargaining agreements covering most of our union employees in Atlantic City will expire. We will begin negotiations for renewal agreements before their expiration and are hopeful that we will be able to reach agreements with the respective unions without any work stoppage. In the event of a strike, it is possible that such actions could have a material impact on our operations. From time to time, we have experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our non-union employees. These efforts have achieved some success to date. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future. The impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our profits.\nWe may be subject to material environmental liability, including as a result of unknown environmental contamination.\nThe casino properties business is subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as emissions to air, discharges to streams and rivers and releases of hazardous substances and pollutants into the environment, as well as handling and disposal from municipal/non-hazardous waste, and which also apply to current and previous owners or operators of real estate generally. Federal examples of these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Certain of these environmental laws may impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused particular contamination or release of hazardous substances. Should unknown contamination be discovered on our property, or should a release of hazardous substances occur on our property, we could be required to investigate and remediate the contamination and could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury or investigation and remediation costs incurred in connection with the contamination or release, which may be substantial. Moreover, such contamination may also impair our ability to use the affected property. Such liability could be joint and several in nature, regardless of fault, and could affect us even if such property is vacated. The potential for substantial costs and an inability to use the property could adversely affect our business.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses we could suffer, and, in the future, our insurance costs may increase significantly or we may be unable to obtain the same level of insurance coverage.\nWe may suffer damage to our property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism) that could severely disrupt our business or subject it to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although we maintain insurance (including property, casualty, terrorism and business interruption), it may be inadequate or unavailable to cover all of the risks to which our business and assets may be exposed. In several cases we maintain extremely high deductibles or self-insure against specific losses. Should an uninsured loss (including a loss which is less than our deductible) or loss in excess of insured limits occur, it could have a significant adverse impact on our operations and revenues.\nWe generally renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of coverage becomes too high, we may need to reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage in order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount. Among other factors, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in the current U.S. statutory requirement that insurance carriers offer coverage for certain acts of terrorism could adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits) and additional exclusions from coverage. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may be unable to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nThe success of third parties adjacent to our properties is important to our ability to generate revenue and operate our business and any deterioration to their success could materially adversely affect our revenue and result of operations.\nIn certain cases, we do not own the businesses and amenities adjacent to our properties. However, the adjacent third-party businesses and amenities stimulate additional traffic through our complexes, including the casinos, which are our largest generators of revenue. Any decrease in the popularity of, or the number of customers visiting, these adjacent businesses and amenities may lead to a corresponding decrease in the traffic through our complexes, which would negatively affect our business and operating results. Further, if newly opening properties, such as The Cromwell, are not as popular as expected, we will not realize the increase in traffic through our properties that we expect as a result of their opening, which would negatively affect our business projections.\nCompromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' personal information could materially harm our reputation and business.\nWe collect and store confidential, personal information relating to our customers for various business purposes, including marketing and financial purposes, and credit card information for processing payments. For example, we handle, collect and store personal information in connection with our customers staying at our hotels and enrolling in our Total Rewards program. We may share this personal and confidential information with vendors or other third parties in connection with processing of transactions, operating certain aspects of our business or for marketing purposes. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws and regulations as well as the applicable laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. Privacy law is an area that changes often and varies significantly by jurisdiction. We may incur significant costs in order to ensure compliance with the various applicable privacy requirements. In addition, privacy laws and regulations may limit our ability to market to our customers.\nWe assess and monitor the security of collection, storage and transmission of customer information on an ongoing basis. We utilize commercially available software and technologies to monitor, assess and secure our network. Further, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not us. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers' confidential personal information, our network and other systems and those of third parties, such as service providers, could be compromised by a third party breach of our system security or that of a third party provider or as a result by purposeful or accidental actions of third parties, our employees or those employees of a third party. Advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach. As a result of any security breach, customer information or other proprietary data may be accessed or transmitted by or to a third party. Despite these measures, there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information.\nAny loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, customers' or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information, which could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur obligation to fund multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us.\nWe contribute to and participate in various multi-employer pension plans for employees represented by certain unions. We are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. We do not administer these plans and, generally, are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans. The Pension Protection Act enacted in 2006, or the PPA, requires under-funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios. Based on the information available to us, some of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are either \"critical\" or \"endangered\" as those terms are defined in the PPA. Specifically, the Pension Plan of the UNITE HERE National Retirement Fund is less than 65% funded. We cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, we may be required to make to these plans. However, plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period. Furthermore, under current law, upon the termination of a multi-employer pension plan, due to the withdrawal of all its contributing employers (a mass withdrawal), or in the event of a withdrawal by us, which we consider from time to time, we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liabilities, that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn January 2015, the Trustees of the National Retirement Fund (\u201cNRF\u201d), a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan, voted to expel the CEC controlled group (\u201cCEC Group\u201d) from the plan. NRF claims that CEOC\u2019s bankruptcy presents an \u201cactuarial risk\u201d to the plan purportedly permitting such expulsion. The CEC affiliates that are included in NRF are Caesars Atlantic City, Bally\u2019s Atlantic City, Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City, Harrah\u2019s Philadelphia and the Las Vegas laundry. NRF has advised the CEC Group that its expulsion has triggered withdrawal liability with a present value of approximately $360 million, payable in 80 quarterly payments of about $6 million.\nThe CEC Group disputes NRF\u2019s authority to take such action. Prior to NRF\u2019s vote, the CEC Group reiterated its commitment to remain in the plan and not seek rejection of any collective bargaining agreement in which the obligation to contribute to NRF exists. CEOC is current with respect to pension contributions. The CEC Group is pursuing several litigation strategies to challenge NRF\u2019s action. There can be no assurance that our strategies will have a successful outcome, and the CEC Group may become liable for the withdrawal liability, which would have an adverse impact on us.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls that existed at December 31, 2014. If the material weaknesses are not remediated promptly, our ability to both timely and accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, each year we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting, our management is required to assess and issue assertions concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs of December 31, 2014, management identified material weaknesses as described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d within this report. Accordingly, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are not effective as of December 31, 2014.\nThe existence of these material weaknesses could have an adverse effect on management\u2019s ability to prevent or detect material errors on a timely basis. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business and our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nAlthough we believe we are taking appropriate actions to remediate the material weaknesses we identified to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we have taken measures to ensure the accuracy of our financial statements to date and will continue such measures in the future until we have remediated the material weaknesses as described in Item 9A.\nThe implementation of CES contemplated activities may be subject to regulatory and other approvals in certain jurisdictions, which may be delayed or which we may not receive.\nIn May 2014, we, together with CEOC, CERP and CGPH formed CES, a services joint venture. CES manages certain enterprise assets and the other assets it owns, licenses or controls and employs the corresponding employees and other employees who provide services to CEOC, CERP and CGP LLC, their affiliates and their respective properties and systems under each property's corresponding property management agreement. CES manages certain enterprise-wide assets of ours, including the intellectual property that CEOC and its affiliates currently license to CGP LLC and other subsidiaries of CEC. In addition, certain of CEOC\u2019s subsidiaries' property management agreements have been assigned to CES and others may be assigned in the future. While CES has attained certain key regulatory approvals, before CES can commence all activities in all jurisdictions, it may be required to\nobtain additional regulatory approvals in certain jurisdictions. For example, employees employed by CES are, in the limited purpose of the services they provide to properties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri and Ontario, Canada, employed jointly by CES and CEOC in respect of such services and will be so jointly employed until CES obtains the necessary regulatory approvals in each of the aforementioned jurisdictions. CES intends to file for all regulatory approvals in jurisdictions in which such approval is required, but we cannot be sure when, or if, we will receive such approvals or that CES will be able to be implemented in all intended jurisdictions.\nDue to the participation of CEOC, CGPH, and CERP in CES, we may not control CES and our interests may not align with the interests of the other members of CES.\nCEOC, CGPH, and CERP are members of CES, and each relies on CES to provide it and its subsidiaries with intellectual property licenses and property management services, among other services. CEOC, CGPH and CERP are each required to contribute as necessary to fund CES\u2019s operating costs and capital requirements in proportion to their respective ownership interest in CES. The members of CES are required to fund its capital expenditures in agreed portions on an annual basis. The amount each member will be required to fund in future years will be subject to the review and approval of the CES steering committee. CEOC, CGPH and CERP, together, control CES through the CES steering committee, which is comprised of one representative from each of CEOC, CGPH and CERP. Conflicts of interest may arise between Caesars Entertainments\u2019 subsidiaries. Most decisions by CES require the consent of two of the three steering committee members. To the extent we are unable to control the consent of at least two of the three steering committee members, we will be unable to cause CES to take actions that our in our interest. In addition, certain decisions by CES may not be made without unanimous consent of the members, including consent by CGPH, which we do not control. These actions include any decision with respect to liquidation or dissolution of CES, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all the assets of CES, usage of CES assets in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of CES, material amendment to CES\u2019s operating agreement, admission of new investors to CES and filing of any bankruptcy or similar action by CES. Thus, CGPH may block certain actions by CES that are in our interest.\nWe are controlled by the Sponsors, whose interests may not be aligned with ours.\nHamlet Holdings, the members of which are comprised of individuals affiliated with each of the Sponsors, as of December 31, 2014, controls approximately 61% of our common stock, and controls us, pursuant to an irrevocable proxy providing Hamlet Holdings with sole voting and sole dispositive power over those shares. As a result, the Sponsors have the power to elect all of our directors. Moreover, Hamlet Holdings has the ability to vote on any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, Hamlet Holdings is in a position to exert a significant influence over us, and the direction of our business and results of operations. The interests of the Sponsors could conflict with or differ from the interests of other holders of our securities. For example, the concentration of ownership held by the Sponsors could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of us or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination which another stockholder may otherwise view favorably. Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies they hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. One or both of the Sponsors may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. A sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by funds affiliated with the Sponsors or their co-investors could cause our stock price to decline. So long as Hamlet Holdings continues to hold the irrevocable proxy, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.\nIn addition, we have an executive committee that serves at the discretion of our board of directors and is authorized to take such actions as it reasonably determines appropriate. Currently, the executive committee may act by a majority of its members, provided that at least one member affiliated with TPG and Apollo must approve any action of the executive committee.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock, including in connection with the merger with CAC, may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nAs of March 1, 2015, there were 145 million shares outstanding, all of which are the same class of voting common stock. All of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be eligible for resale under Rule 144 or Rule 701 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"), subject to volume limitations, applicable holding period requirements or other contractual restrictions. The Sponsors have the ability to cause us to register the resale of its shares, and our management members who hold shares will have the ability to include their shares in such registration.\nWe sold 7 million shares of our common stock in 2014 and 11 million shares in 2013. In connection with the merger with CAC, we expect to issue a significant number of shares of our common stock. In addition, we may issue shares of common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments or for any other reason that our board of directors deems advisable. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or other securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock or other securities, including future sales by the Sponsors, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares of common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent a holder of our common stock from being able to sell their shares. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects, along with that of CGP LLC;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, together with those of CGP LLC, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in government and environmental regulation, including gaming taxes;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\narrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or members of our management team;\n\u2022\nissuance of common stock in connection with the merger with CAC;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lockup agreements; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the gaming, lodging, hospitality and entertainment industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nBecause we have not paid dividends since being acquired by the Sponsors in 2008 and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, holders of our common stock should not expect to receive dividends on shares of our common stock.\nWe have no present plans to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and, for the foreseeable future, intend to retain all of our earnings for use in our business. The declaration of any future dividends by us is within the discretion of our Board and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, as well as any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nHamlet Holdings controls a majority of our voting common stock. As a result, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under the NASDAQ rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company\" and we have elected not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees.\nAs a result of these exemptions, we do not have a majority of independent directors nor do our nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors and we are not required to have an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees. Accordingly, a holder of our common stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nOur bylaws and certificate of incorporation contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of our bylaws and our certificate of incorporation may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablishing limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\npermitting only an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Board to fix the number of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nempowering only the board of directors to fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent if less than 50.1% of our outstanding common stock is controlled by the Sponsors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting amendments to the bylaws without the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the board of directors or the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the total voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote;\n\u2022\nprohibiting amendments to the certificate of incorporation relating to stockholder meetings, amendments to the bylaws or certificate of incorporation, or the election or classification of the board of directors without the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote on any matter; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of us. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.\nTogether, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant common stock controlled by Hamlet Holdings, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nPRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\nThis Form 10-K contains or may contain \"forward-looking statements\" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events. Further, statements that include words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"project,\" \"might,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"present,\" \"preserve,\" or \"pursue,\" or the negative of these words or other words or expressions of similar meaning may identify forward-looking statements.
