RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider and carefully read all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report and in our other public filings. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your original investment. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Relating to Macroeconomic Conditions and Our Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we expect this adverse impact to continue.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our business and financial performance, particularly in fiscal year 2020, and we expect this adverse impact to continue. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and any resurgences of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, we temporarily closed a significant number of our stores globally. While most of our stores have reopened, we may face new or longer term store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives and vaccine mandates, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In addition, many of our customers, including significant customers in our wholesale and franchise distribution channels, have closed many of their stores, either temporarily or permanently, which has adversely impacted our revenues from these customers and franchisees. As a result, we expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, consumer fears about becoming ill with the disease may continue, which has and is likely to continue to adversely affect foot traffic to our and our customers' stores. Consumer spending generally has and may in the future also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession or inflationary pressures, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales in our stores and our e-commerce channel and may cause our wholesale customers to purchase fewer products from us. Furthermore, if sales do not meet expectations because of unexpected effects on consumer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting surplus inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned gross margins. Any continued significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, our and our customers' stores, caused by COVID-19, and any continued decreased spending at stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, would result in a loss of sales and profits and, as a result, adversely impact our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. Current vessel, container and other transportation shortages, labor shortages and port congestion globally have delayed and are expected to continue to delay inventory orders and, in turn, deliveries to our wholesale customers and availability in our company-operated stores and e-commerce sites. These supply chain and logistics disruptions have impacted our inventory levels and net revenues, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2021, and could impact our sales volumes in future periods. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, such supply chain disruptions resulted in lost revenues of an estimated $50 million. We have also incurred in the fourth quarter of 2021, higher freight and other distribution costs, including air freight, to mitigate these delays. We are also seeing negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event we increase prices of our products, there can be no assurance that consumers will accept such increases, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or requirements, we also closed many of our corporate office and other facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, and implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees. Although we recently reopened our corporate offices and other facilities and have implemented a hybrid work policy for our corporate employees, we may face future closure requirements and other\noperational restrictions due to, among other factors, evolving governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies, social distancing requirements or vaccine mandates. This hybrid policy may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business. Longer term, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also threaten the health of our employees and adversely impact our health care costs.\nWe continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating, financial and tax planning projections, including assumptions regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and the global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic. However, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operations, and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments. In particular, we believe the ultimate impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on, among other things, the further spread and duration of COVID-19, including the impact of variants and resurgences, the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness, the availability, widespread distribution, and acceptance of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic, including recent inflationary pressures. Even in those regions where we have experienced business recovery, should those regions fail to fully contain COVID-19 or suffer a COVID-19 relapse, those markets may not recover as quickly or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The pandemic may also affect our business, operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks.\nGlobal economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:\n\u2022Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past and in the future may result in reduced demand for our products, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, and lower gross margins.\n\u2022In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.\n\u2022We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.\n\u2022Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton) and related inflationary pressures could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.\n\u2022If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or have trouble obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\n\u2022If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.\nIn uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe are a global company with significant revenues and earnings generated internationally, which exposes us to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as political and economic risks.\nA significant portion of our revenues and earnings are generated internationally. In addition, a substantial amount of our products comes from sources outside the country of distribution. As a result, we are both directly and indirectly (through our suppliers) subject to the risks of doing business outside the United States, including:\n\u2022currency fluctuations, which have impacted our results of operations significantly in recent years;\n\u2022political, economic and social instability;\n\u2022changes in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022inflationary pressures;\n\u2022regulatory restrictions on our ability to operate in our preferred manner;\n\u2022rapidly changing regulatory restrictions and requirements, including in the areas of data privacy, sustainability and responses to climate change, which could result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; and\n\u2022less protective foreign laws relating to intellectual property.\nThe functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, including debt, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Foreign governmental policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. Given the unpredictability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, ongoing or unusual volatility may adversely impact our business and financial conditions.\nFurthermore, due to our global operations, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations affecting our business, such as those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, antitrust and competition, environmental protection, consumer protection, privacy, and anti-corruption, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we have put into place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, subcontractors, and agents could take actions that violate these requirements. Violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.\nWe extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. The ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, particularly for retailers, could also have an effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition.\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, manufacturers, customers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters, and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past temporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our vendors, manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, manufacturers, customers, distribution centers or vendors are located, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties' computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. In addition, a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending, any of which could in turn result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise. Further, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which may affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our third-party vendors and other suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. In addition, the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in\nchanges in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe believe the diversity of locations in which we operate, our operational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services position us well, but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could still experience operational challenges, depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or regarding particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel. For example, our global headquarters is located in California near major geologic faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past. Further, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services, or supply systems, we could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers. These events could result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brands.\nOur success depends in large part on the value, overall health and reputation of our brands, which are integral to our business and the implementation of our \"Brand Led\" strategy for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brands will depend largely on the success of our marketing, design and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality products supported by engaging marketing campaigns. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences. Our brands and reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives if we fail to deliver high-quality products acceptable to our customers and consumers or if we face or mishandle a product recall.\nOur brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our brands, corporate integrity and culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us or our products, the production methods or locations of any of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, consumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation, sales and brand image, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative claims or publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims or publicity. In addition, we or our senior executives may from time to time take positions or make statements on social issues that may be unpopular with some consumers or customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such consumers or customers, and which could adversely impact our results in certain locations. Adverse publicity could undermine consumer confidence in our brands and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if such publicity is unfounded. Any harm to our brands and reputation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe appeal of our brand may also depend on the success of our ESG initiatives, which require company-wide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage risks and costs to us, our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing fossil fuel and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal welfare, and land use. These risks may also include increased pressure to expand our disclosures in these areas, make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. The metrics we disclose, such as emissions and water usage, whether they be based on the standards we set for ourselves or those set by others, may influence our reputation and the value of our brand. In addition, as we work to align with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\u201cSASB\u201d), we may expand our disclosures in these areas. This transparency is consistent with our commitment to executing on a strategy that reflects the economic, social, and environmental impact we have on the world while advancing and complementing our business strategy. Our failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our business, financial performance, and growth. By electing to set and share publicly these metrics and expand upon our disclosures, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG activities. As a result, we could damage our reputation and the value of our brand if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report. Any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics, expanding our disclosure or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics or disclosures could adversely affect our business, financial performance, and growth.\nFailure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products, or actions taken by our endorsers, could harm our business.\nWe establish relationships with artists, designers, musicians and other public figures to develop, evaluate and promote our products. If we are unable to recruit endorsers with consumer appeal or endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken or statements made by our endorsers, associated with our products or brand or otherwise, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to forecast and respond timely to consumer demand and market conditions and offer on-trend and new and updated products at attractive price points.\nThe global apparel industry is characterized by ever-changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication, and by the rapid replication of new products by competitors. The apparel industry is also impacted by changing consumer preferences regarding spending categories generally, including shifts away from traditional consumer spending and towards \"experiential\" spending and sustainable products. As a result, our success depends in large part on our ability to develop, market and deliver innovative and stylish products at a pace, intensity, and price competitive with other brands in the markets in which we sell our products. In addition, we must create products at a range of price points that appeal to the consumers of both our wholesale customers and our dedicated retail stores and e-commerce sites situated in each of our diverse geographic regions. Our development and production cycles take place prior to full visibility into all of these factors for the coming seasons. Failure on our part to forecast and respond timely to consumer demand and market conditions and to regularly and rapidly develop innovative and stylish products and update core products could limit sales growth, adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and negatively impact the consumer traffic in our dedicated retail stores. In addition, if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels, which may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices. This could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and could adversely affect our gross margins. For example, if sales do not meet expectations because of unexpected effects on inventory supply and consumer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products, including as a result of a surge in consumer demand in places where the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic decrease, we may experience inventory shortages, which could delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. Moreover, our newer products may not produce as high a gross margin as our traditional products and thus may have an adverse effect on our overall margins and profitability.\nWe depend on a group of key wholesale customers for a significant portion of our revenues. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer's performance or financial position could harm our business and financial condition.\nSales to our top ten wholesale customers accounted for 32%, 29% and 26% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No single customer represented 10% or more of our net revenues in any of these years. While we have long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers, we do not have long-term contracts with them. As a result, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis, and the relationship, as well as particular orders, can generally be terminated by either party at any time. If any major wholesale customer decreases or ceases its purchases from us, cancels its orders, delays or defaults on its payment obligations to us, reduces the floor space, assortments, fixtures or advertising for our products or changes its manner of doing business with us for any reason, such as due to store closures, decreased foot traffic, inflationary pressures or recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, such actions are expected to adversely affect our business and financial condition. Furthermore, certain of our major wholesale customers may seek to distribute our products globally in a manner or at prices that impact the positioning that we seek to promote in our other channels of distribution. In addition, a decline in the performance or financial condition of a major wholesale customer- including bankruptcy or liquidation- could result in the adverse impact on revenues and cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to our receivables from that customer or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer. Permanent store closures and other developments in these proceedings have adversely affected our sales to these customers. We expect additional closures and other developments in these proceedings will likely adversely affect our sales to these customers in the future, even if they continue operations. In addition, store closures, decreased foot traffic, inflationary pressures and recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect the performance and will likely adversely affect the financial condition of many of these customers. The foregoing may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur efforts to expand our retail business may not be successful, which could impact our operating results.\nOne of our key strategic priorities is our \u201cDTC First\u201d strategy, which includes our plan to become a leading world-class omni-channel retailer by expanding our consumer reach in brand-dedicated stores globally, including making selective\ninvestments in company-operated stores and e-commerce sites, and other brand-dedicated store models. In many locations, we face major, established retail competitors that may be able to better attract consumers and execute their retail strategies. In addition, a retail operating model involves substantial investments in equipment and property, information systems, inventory and personnel. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with these investments, a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of stores, including the closure of stores and decreased foot traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant costs and impacts to our margins. Our ability to grow our retail channel also depends on the availability and cost of real estate that meets our criteria for foot traffic, square footage, demographics and other factors. Failure to identify and secure adequate new locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of the fleet of stores, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems, data science and artificial intelligence initiatives, and significant operational changes. Our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nIf the technology-based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base, could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, consumers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors, and to do comparison shopping, as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, secure, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, as use of our digital platforms continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers' needs. If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline. Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase our sales through our third-party distribution channels.\nIn addition to our brand-dedicated company-operated retail stores and e-commerce sites, our third-party distribution channels include department stores, specialty retailers, mass channel retailers, franchised or other brand-dedicated stores, and shop-in-shops.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase sales of our products through these distribution channels for several reasons, including the following:\n\u2022the retailers in these channels maintain- and seek to grow- substantial private-label and exclusive offerings as they strive to differentiate the brands and products they offer from those of their competitors;\n\u2022the retailers change their apparel strategies in a way that shifts focus away from our typical consumer or that otherwise results in a reduction of sales of our products generally, such as a reduction of fixture spaces devoted to our products or a shift to other brands;\n\u2022other channels, including vertically-integrated specialty stores and e-commerce sites, account for a substantial portion of jeanswear and casual wear sales. In some of our mature markets, these stores and sites have placed competitive pressure on our primary distribution channels, and many of these stores and sites are now looking to our developing markets to grow their business; and\n\u2022shrinking points of distribution, including fewer doors at our customer locations, store closures and decreased foot traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or bankruptcy or financial difficulties of a customer.\nFurther success by retailer private-labels, vertically-integrated specialty stores and e-commerce sites may continue to adversely affect the sales of our products across all channels, as well as the profitability of our brand-dedicated stores.\nAdditionally, our ability to secure or maintain retail floor space, product display prominence, market share and sales in these channels depends on our ability to offer differentiated products, to increase retailer profitability on our products and the strength of our brands, and such efforts could have an adverse impact on our margins.\nIn addition, the retail industry in the United States has experienced substantial consolidation over the last decade, and further consolidation may occur. Consolidation in the retail industry has typically resulted in store closures, centralized purchasing decisions and increased emphasis by retailers on inventory management and productivity, which could result in fewer stores carrying our products or reduced demand by retailers for our products. In addition, we and other suppliers may experience increased customer leverage over us and greater exposure to credit risk as a result of industry consolidation. Furthermore, consolidation may be partly due to consumers continuing to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers, which in turn exposes our products to increased competition. Any of the foregoing results can impact, and have adversely impacted in the past, our net revenues, margins and ability to operate efficiently.\nIf we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on both company-owned and third-party distribution facilities to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce consumers throughout the world. As part of the pursuit for improved organizational agility and marketplace responsiveness, we have consolidated the number of distribution facilities we rely upon and continue to look for opportunities for further consolidation in certain regions. Such consolidation may make our operations more vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages or disruption (including as a consequence of public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures imposed by governments), labor disputes, worker shortages, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the impacts of climate change, earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting these distribution centers. In addition, distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from their distribution facilities, which also may be adversely affected by work stoppages or disruption, labor disputes and pandemics. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, whether company-owned or third-party, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected.\nUnexpected obstacles in new markets and in our existing markets may limit our expansion opportunities and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends in part on our continued expansion efforts in existing markets and in new markets where we may have limited familiarity and experience with regulatory environments and market practices. In particular, one of our key strategies is to further diversify our portfolio and grow market share across geographies, categories, genders and channels. We may not be able to expand or successfully operate in those markets, categories and channels as a result of unfamiliarity or other unexpected barriers to expansion or entry. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired Beyond Yoga\u00ae, a premium athletic and lifestyle apparel brand. In connection with our expansion efforts, we may encounter obstacles, including new competitors, cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, economic or governmental instability, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and differences in consumer tastes and preferences. Our failure to develop our business in new markets or disappointing growth in existing markets that we may experience could harm our business and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions of and investments in new businesses, including the Beyond Yoga\u00ae acquisition, could harm our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire or invest in businesses or partnerships that we believe could complement our business or offer growth opportunities. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired Beyond Yoga\u00ae, a premium athletic and lifestyle apparel brand. The expected synergies between Levi Strauss & Co. and Beyond Yoga\u00ae, such as those related to our entry into the activewear category, complementing our growing women\u2019s business and enabling the allocation of global resources and infrastructure to significantly expand Beyond Yoga\u00ae, building on its largely digital ecosystem, may not materialize. Our management team has limited experience in addressing the challenges of integrating management teams, strategies, cultures and organizations of two companies. The acquisition may not be well received by the customers or employees of either company, and this could hurt our brand and result in the loss of key employees. The pursuit and integration of such acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses, regardless of whether the acquisition or investment is ultimately completed. In addition, acquisitions and investments may not perform as expected or cause us to assume unrecognized or underestimated liabilities. Further, if we are able to successfully identify and acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel or operations, effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition, or the acquired business may have inadequate or ineffective controls and procedures, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may, from time to time, evaluate and pursue other strategic investments or acquisitions. These involve various inherent risks and the benefits sought may not be realized. The acquisition of Beyond Yoga\u00ae or other strategic investments or acquisitions may not create value and may harm our brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face risks arising from restructuring of our operations and uncertainty with respect to our ability to achieve any anticipated cost savings associated with such restructuring.\nWe continuously assess opportunities to streamline operations and fuel long-term profitable growth. Future charges related to such actions may harm our profitability in the periods incurred.\nIn 2020, we announced and implemented a restructuring initiative, which involved a reduction in workforce in response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and included realignment of our top level organization to support our new strategies, which realignment became effective in 2021. The initiative included the elimination of approximately 15% of our global non-retail and non-manufacturing employee population. The final phase of the initiative, which included reorganization of the underlying operations and employees to support the top level organization was completed in 2021.\nWe have incurred $98.7 million of restructuring charges related to this restructuring initiative. Unexpected charges in the future may harm our profitability in the periods incurred.\nImplementation of this reduction in workforce, or any similar future restructuring program actions, presents a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service levels to customers and consumers;\n\u2022potential adverse effects on our internal control environment and inability to preserve adequate internal controls relating to our general and administrative functions in connection with the decision to outsource certain business service activities;\n\u2022actual or perceived disruption to suppliers, distribution networks and other important operational relationships and the inability to resolve potential conflicts in a timely manner;\n\u2022difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality from our contract manufacturers;\n\u2022diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and strategic objectives; and\n\u2022failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees.\nBecause of these and other factors, we cannot predict whether we will fully realize the purpose and anticipated operational benefits or cost savings of any global productivity actions and, if we do not, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, there may be a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the reduction in workforce, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. Furthermore, additional restructuring or reorganization activities may be required in the future.\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in our third and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in our first and second fiscal quarters. In addition, our customers and consumers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules, or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic, social or political unrest, general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, including the effects of climate change, the availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and data to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, compromise or interruption of that technology or data could lead to adverse consequences, including harm to our ability to effectively operate our business, claims that we breached our data privacy security obligations, harm to our reputation and a loss of customers or sales.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, store, use, transmit, disclose or otherwise process proprietary confidential and sensitive data, including personal information, intellectual property, and trade secrets. We rely upon third parties (such as service providers) for our data processing-related activities.\nWe are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, third-party services and artificial intelligence, across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting\npurposes, retail operations and other business activities. These information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these systems.\nOver the last several years, we have been and continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. For example, over the next several years, we plan to continue the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system across the company.\nOur work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and we will continue to invest in these efforts. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or information loss. Cyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase. In addition to traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states and nation-state supported actors now engage in attacks. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social engineering, such as phishing, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions and large-scale, complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states and nation-state supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments.\nAny breach of our or our service providers' networks, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers', users' or employees' personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation, resulting in lost sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits and inspections) or significant legal and remediation expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach.\nThe failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of the threats described above as well as a result of natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the increased use of employee-owned devices for communications as well as work-from-home arrangements, such as those implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, present additional operational risks to our information technology systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyber-attacks. Our software or information technology systems, or that of third parties upon who we rely to operate our business, may have material vulnerabilities and, despite our efforts to identify and remediate these vulnerabilities, our efforts may not be successful or we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities. It may be expensive and time-consuming to remediate material vulnerabilities, and our operations, reputation, sales and financial performance may be adversely impacted if we are not able to successfully and promptly remediate such vulnerabilities. Further, like other companies in the retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of our third party software service providers, was subject to a data security incident and, in 2021, a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache log4j was identified as affecting large amounts of systems worldwide. We completed investigations of these incidents and concluded that they resulted in no material adverse impact to us. However, we cannot provide assurance that these and other attacks will not have an impact in the future.\nWe also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If these systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on information technology systems and personal information collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors, and consumers. Any interruption in\ninformation technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.\nAs we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions. Disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations.\nAs part of our long-term profitable growth strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. For example, we currently outsource a significant portion of our information technology, finance, customer relations and customer service functions to Wipro Limited and third-party service providers are also relied upon to design, program, maintain and service our ERP systems. While we believe we conduct appropriate diligence before entering into agreements with any outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more of such entities to meet our performance standards and expectations, including with respect to data security, compliance with data protection and privacy laws, providing services on a timely basis or providing services at the prices we expect, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For example, our outsourcing entities and other third-party service providers may experience difficulties, disruptions, delays, or failures in their ability to deliver services to us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We could face increased costs or disruption associated with finding replacement vendors or hiring new employees in order to return these services in-house, which may have a significant impact on the cost and timing of receipt of inventory for future seasons. Any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business. We may outsource other functions in the future, which would increase our reliance on third parties.\nWe currently rely on contract manufacturing of our products. Our inability to secure production sources meeting our quality, cost, social and environmental risk mitigation and other requirements, or failures by our contract manufacturers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we sourced approximately 99% of our products from independent contract manufacturers that purchase fabric and make our products and may also provide us with design and development services. As a result, we must locate and secure production capacity. We depend on contract manufacturers to maintain adequate financial resources, including access to sufficient credit, to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, and maintain sufficient development and manufacturing capacity in an environment characterized by continuing cost pressure and demands for product innovation and speed-to-market. In addition, we currently do not have any material long-term contracts with any of our contract manufacturers. Under our current arrangements with our contract manufacturers, these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time. While we have historically worked with numerous manufacturers, in recent years we have begun consolidating the number of contract manufacturers from which we source our products. In addition, some of our contract manufacturers have merged. Reliance on a fewer number of contract manufacturers involves risk, and any difficulties or failures to perform by our contract manufacturers could cause delays in product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations. If our contract manufacturers, or any raw material vendors or suppliers on which our contract manufacturers rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product on a timely basis could be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Also, we have certain minimum inventory purchase commitments, including fabric commitments, with suppliers that secure a portion of material needs for future seasons. If we do not satisfy the minimum purchase commitments, due to conditions such as decreased demand, we may be charged for estimated adverse purchase commitments.\nA contract manufacturer's failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards, or interference with our ability to receive shipments due to factors such as port or transportation conditions or security incidents, could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers. Failing to make timely deliveries may cause our customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries, impose non-compliance charges, demand reduced prices, or reduce future orders, any of which could harm our sales and margins. If we need to replace any contract manufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional contract manufacturers on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate additional contract manufacturers with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner.\nWe require contract manufacturers to make progress toward our sustainability goals and meet our standards and policies in terms of working conditions, environmental protection, raw materials, facility safety, security and other matters before we are willing to place business with them. As such, we may not be able to obtain the lowest-cost production. We also may need to move our production to the extent that we determine our contract manufacturers are not in compliance with our standards or applicable government standards, sanctions or other restrictions. We may also encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our contract manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. In addition, the labor and business practices of apparel manufacturers and their suppliers, including raw material suppliers, have received increased attention from the media, non-governmental organizations, consumers and governmental agencies in recent years. Any failure by our contract manufacturers or their suppliers to adhere to the LS&Co. code of conduct, labor or other\nlaws, appropriate labor or business practices, safety, structural or environmental standards, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could harm our business and reputation.\nOur suppliers may be impacted by economic conditions and cycles and changing laws and regulatory requirements which could impact their ability to do business with us or cause us to terminate our relationship with them and require us to find replacements, which we may have difficulty doing.\nOur suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, including related to inflationary pressures, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, regulatory developments such as reporting requirements on the use of \"conflict\" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, or compliance with the recent sanctions and customs trade orders issued by the U.S. government related to raw materials, entities and individuals who are connected to a region of China, could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. We have been and may continue to be subject to costs associated with regulations, including for the diligence pertaining to these matters and the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The impact of such regulations may result in a limited pool of acceptable suppliers, and we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face regulatory challenges in complying with applicable sanctions and trade regulations and reputational challenges with our consumers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the material used in the products we sell.\nThe global apparel industry is subject to intense cost and pricing pressure.\nThe apparel industry is characterized by low barriers to entry for both suppliers and marketers, global sourcing through suppliers located throughout the world, trade liberalization, continuing movement of product sourcing to lower cost countries, regular promotional activity, and the ongoing emergence of new competitors with widely varying strategies and resources. These factors have contributed, and we expect them to continue to contribute in the future, to intense pricing pressure and uncertainty throughout the supply chain. Pricing pressure has been exacerbated by the variability and availability of raw materials in recent months, combined with labor and cost inflation and uncertainty throughout the supply chain. This pressure could have adverse effects on our business and financial condition, including:\n\u2022reduced gross margins across our product lines and distribution channels;\n\u2022increased retailer demands for allowances, incentives, and other forms of economic support;\n\u2022unfavorable consumer reactions to price increases; and\n\u2022increased pressure on us to reduce our production costs and operating expenses.\nIncreases in the price or availability of raw materials could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.\nThe majority of our products are made of cotton, where the remaining balance are made of synthetics, cotton/synthetic blends, and viscose. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation, sanctions and policy, economic climates, market speculation compliance with our working condition, environmental protection, and other standards, and other unpredictable factors. For example, compliance with the recent sanctions and trade orders issued by the U.S. government related to raw materials, entities and individuals who are connected to a region of China could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials, including cotton, used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. Any and all of these factors may be exacerbated by global climate change. Cotton prices have begun to increase and previously suffered from unprecedented variability and uncertainty. They may fluctuate significantly again in the future. In the event of a significant disruption or unavailability in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. In addition, prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in the regions where our contract manufacturers are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. Fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs. Increases in raw material costs or wage rates, unless sufficiently offset by our pricing actions, may cause a\ndecrease in our profitability, and negatively impact our sales volume. These factors may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas, as well as risks associated with potential tariffs, transportation disruptions or a global trade war.\nWe import materials and finished garments into all of our operating regions. Our ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes and work stoppages, political unrest, security incidents, severe weather, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to our customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transportation costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition, specifically our gross margin and overall profitability.\nSubstantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations, and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the failure by us or our suppliers to comply with trade regulations or similar laws, could harm our business. In this regard, the increasingly protectionist trade policy in the United States has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations.\nChanges in tax policy or trade regulations or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn 2018, the U.S. government announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imported into the United States, which has resulted in reciprocal tariffs from the European Union on goods, including denim products, imported from the United States. Because we manufacture most of our products outside the United States, these reciprocal tariffs are not expected to have a material impact on our business. The U.S government also imposed tariffs on goods imported from China in connection with China\u2019s intellectual property practices and forced technology transfer, which have not been lifted or changed by the Biden Administration. Currently, of the products that we sell in the United States, less than 1% are manufactured in China. If the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative follows through on the next proposed tranche of China tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States or other countries in connection with a global trade war, the cost of our products manufactured in China or other countries and imported into the United States or other countries could increase, which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe loss of high-quality employees, including members of our executive management and other key employees, or the failure to attract and retain key personnel or maintain our workplace culture could harm our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continued service of our high-quality employees, including our executive management team and other key employees, and the loss of the services of any key individual, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our future success also depends, in part, on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our employees sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for experienced and well-qualified employees in our industry is particularly intense in many of the places where we do business, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future office environments, adoption of new work models, and our business requirements and/or expectations about when or how often for employees to work either on-site or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees. As certain jobs and employers increasingly operate remotely, traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that cannot be fully predicted at this time. If our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies\u2019 policies, it could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. Moreover, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. We believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining, and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees.\nMost of the employees in our production and distribution facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and any material job actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn North America, most of our distribution employees are covered by various collective bargaining agreements. Outside North America, most of our production and distribution employees are covered by either industry-sponsored and/or government-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms. Any work stoppages or other job actions by these employees could harm our business and reputation.\nWe have substantial liabilities and cash requirements associated with our postretirement benefits, pension, and deferred compensation plans.\nOur postretirement benefits, pension and deferred compensation plans result in substantial liabilities on our balance sheet. These plans and activities have generated, and will generate, substantial cash requirements for us, and these requirements may increase beyond our expectations in future years based on changing market conditions. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Many variables, such as changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, investment returns and/or the market value of plan assets, can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. Plan liabilities may impair our liquidity, have an unfavorable impact on our ability to obtain financing and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who do not have such liabilities and cash requirements.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Issues and Changes\nWe are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our employees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in one jurisdiction may result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines, or penalties, or enter settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environmental, competition, privacy, and other regulatory matters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\nChanges to trade policy, including tariff and customs regulations, or failure to comply with such regulations may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing trade, manufacturing, development, and investment in the countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations to adapt to or comply with any such changes.\nChanges or proposed changes in U.S. or other countries\u2019 trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. Tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. Further, any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the United States or in other countries could affect the trade environment. We, like many other multinational corporations, conduct a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the United States and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations, our industry, and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nWe periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products.\nThe actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.\nWe may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, manufacturing, use, importation and/or sale of certain products.\nWe take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractual measures such as entering non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, innovations, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely, inadvertently, or improperly used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property rights, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions.\nIn addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe enactment of tax reform legislation, including legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals may pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows.\nWe utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. These rulings and agreements expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm and other adverse business consequences.\nIn addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we handle transactional and personal information, including without limitation personal information about our customers, consumers, and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement.\nAs a result of our processing activities, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting laws, regulatory standards, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of business and personal data by us and on our behalf. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cEU GDPR\u201d), the United Kingdom\u2019s GDPR (the \u201cUK GDPR\u201d) and California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (the \"CCPA\") impose obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. In addition, it is\nanticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. Furthermore, other states in the United States have enacted data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which become effective in 2023. Additionally, laws in certain jurisdictions require data localization and impose restrictions on the transfer of personal information across border. For example, the EU GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA without appropriate safeguards or other measures. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border privacy and security transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe or elsewhere.\nIn addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose in the future, standards with which we are legally or contractually bound to comply. For example, we are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d). The PCI DSS requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information, and noncompliance with PCI-DSS can result in penalties ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per month by credit card companies, litigation, damage to our reputation and revenue losses.\nCompliance with existing and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and may require changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal information on our behalf. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with obligations related to data privacy and security, we could face significant consequences, including, but not limited to, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities (e.g. investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections) or other entities or individuals, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight bans, damage to our reputation and credibility, or inability to process data or operate in certain jurisdictions, any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions around the world. The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies, as well as their officers, directors, employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents, from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable for corrupt or other illegal activities, even if we do not explicitly authorize them. While we have policies and procedures and internal controls to address compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that all of our employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies and laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. To the extent that we learn that any of our employees or third-party intermediaries, business partners or agents do not adhere to our policies, procedures, or internal controls, we are committed to taking appropriate remedial action. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our directors, officers, employees or third-party intermediaries, agents or business partners have or may have violated such laws, we may be required to investigate or to have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. Any violation of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, and criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, and fines, any of which may could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur licensees and franchisees may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, social, environmental, marketing, and other requirements, which could negatively affect our reputation and business.\nWe license our trademarks to third parties for manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of various products. While we enter into comprehensive agreements with our licensees covering product design, product quality, sourcing, manufacturing, marketing and other requirements, our licensees may not comply fully with those agreements. Non-compliance could include marketing products under our brand names that do not meet our quality and other requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet our sustainability standards and policies including our supplier code of conduct or applicable government restrictions and regulations. These activities could harm our brand equity, our reputation, and our business.\nIn addition, we enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in certain circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. While the agreements we have entered and plan to enter in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their businesses, including their stores or websites in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or\nany other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nOur current and future products may experience quality problems from time to time that could result in negative publicity, litigation, product recalls and warranty claims, which could result in decreased revenues and harm to our brands.\nThere can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent or fix all defects that may affect our products. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Such problems could hurt the image of our brands, which is critical to maintaining and expanding our business. Any negative publicity or lawsuits filed against us related to the perceived quality of our products could harm our brand and decrease demand for our products.\nRisks Relating to Securities, Investment and Liquidity\nIf one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us, we may incur significant losses.\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. We also have entered into the Credit Agreement Amendment with several financial institutions that provides us with additional credit availability. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. This risk may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty\u2019s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have debt and interest payment requirements at a level that may restrict our future operations.\nAs of November 28, 2021, we had $1.0 billion of debt, all of which was unsecured, and we had $794.3 million of additional borrowing capacity under our credit facility. The credit facility is secured by domestic inventories, accounts receivable, and other assets such as the Levi\u2019s\u00ae trademarks in the U.S. Our debt requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which reduces funds available for other business purposes and results in us having lower net income (or greater net loss) than we otherwise would have had. This dedicated use of cash could impact our ability to successfully compete by, for example:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including any adverse economic and industry conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as store closures, decreased foot traffic and recession or inflationary pressures;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nA substantial portion of our debt is Euro-denominated senior notes. In addition, borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates and a portion of those borrowings may be in Canadian Dollars. As a result, increases in market interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates could require a greater portion of our cash flow to be used to pay interest, which could further hinder our operations. Increases in market interest rates may also affect the trading price of our debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate. Our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, certain loans made by us and financing extended to us are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate, and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is currently calculated and published for various currencies and periods by the benchmark\u2019s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\"IBA\"), which is regulated for such purposes by the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"). On March 5, 2021, the IBA confirmed that it would cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (overnight and 12 months) immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023.\nAccordingly, in the near future LIBOR will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate. The current and any future reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past,\nincluding during the transition period. The Credit Agreement Amendment contemplates a procedure for transitioning from LIBOR upon the occurrence of specified events. Nevertheless, the consequences of these market developments cannot be entirely predicted and a transition from LIBOR, even if administered consistent with the credit facility\u2019s provisions, could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nBoth New York State and federal legislation in the U.S. is under consideration that if enacted could result, upon the unavailability of LIBOR, in the replacement of certain fallback provisions in LIBOR-based financing agreements. Under the proposed legislation, some of these existing fallback provisions would be replaced by a provision specifying that the replacement rate and related adjustments recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), the committee in the United States convened to ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, would be used to establish the interest-rate on the financing. The legislation would also require the use of the benchmark replacement rate and related adjustments recommended by the AARC in the event that there are no fallback provisions in a financing. The legislation would not impact credit agreements that already include fallbacks to the changes recommended by the ARRC. Any such legislation adopted in New York State would have applicability only to agreements governed by New York law. There can be no assurance as to the final form of any such New York or federal legislation or as to whether any such legislation will be adopted.\nIn the event that one or more LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives are entered into to hedge variable rate indebtedness, the LIBOR rate specified therein will be determined from time to time by reference to a publication page specified in the relevant definitions of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\u201cISDA\u201d). However, if such rate does not appear on the relevant page, and the above-referenced legislation is not adopted that would address the replacement of LIBOR under such derivatives, LIBOR will be determined in accordance with dealer polls conducted by the calculation agent under the agreement governing the derivative. This dealer polling mechanism may not be successful in arriving at a replacement interest rate for LIBOR. Even if the dealer polling mechanism successfully arrives at a replacement interest rate for derivatives, that rate could differ significantly from the interest rates used for our variable-rate indebtedness.\nRestrictions in our notes, indentures and credit facility may limit our activities, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nOur credit facility and certain of the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain restrictions, including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make acquisitions and other investments, prepay specified debt, consolidate, merge or acquire other businesses or engage in other fundamental changes, sell assets, pay dividends and other distributions, repurchase stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into capital leases or certain leases not in the ordinary course of business, enter into certain derivatives, grant negative pledges on our assets, make loans or other investments, guarantee third-party obligations, engage in sale leasebacks and make changes in our corporate structure. These restrictions, in combination with our leveraged condition, may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, grow our business or compete with companies not similarly restricted.\nIf our foreign subsidiaries are unable to distribute cash to us when needed, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations under our debt securities, which could force us to sell assets or use cash that we were planning to use elsewhere in our business.\nWe conduct our international operations through foreign subsidiaries and we only receive the cash that remains after our foreign subsidiaries satisfy their obligations. We may depend upon funds from our foreign subsidiaries for a portion of the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations. Any agreements our foreign subsidiaries enter into with other parties, as well as applicable laws and regulations limiting the right and ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates to pay dividends and remit cash to affiliated companies, may restrict the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. If those subsidiaries are unable to transfer the amount of cash that we need, we may be unable to make payments on our debt obligations, which could force us to sell assets or use cash that we were planning on using elsewhere in our business, which could hinder our operations.\nChanges in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\nOur long-term debt is currently rated BB+ by S&P Global Ratings, Ba1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc and BB+ by Fitch Ratings, Inc. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. In addition, macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing debt on terms that would be acceptable to us.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenues or other operating results;\n\u2022variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022any forward-looking financial or operating information we may provide to the public or securities analysts, any changes in this information or our failure to meet expectations based on this information;\n\u2022actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022whether investors or securities analysts view our stock structure unfavorably, particularly our dual-class structure;\n\u2022additional shares of Class A common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, divestitures or other dispositions;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of companies in our industry, including our vendors and competitors;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of general economic trends, including inflationary pressures;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or events that negatively impact our reputation;\n\u2022developments in new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, industrial accidents, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or responses to these events.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many retail companies\u2019 stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the respective companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and seriously harm our business.\nMoreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenues or earnings forecasts that we may provide.\nAn active trading market for our Class A common stock may not be sustained.\nOur Class A common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"LEVI.\" However, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our Class A common stock will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the likelihood that an active trading market for our Class A common stock will be maintained, the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of Class A common stock when desired or the prices that you may obtain for your shares.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders, including employees, who obtain equity, sell or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. As\nof January 20, 2022 we had outstanding a total of 98,205,835 shares of Class A common stock and 299,815,032 shares of Class B common stock. Of these shares, only the shares of Class A common stock are currently freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), except for any shares held by persons who are not our \u201caffiliates\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act and who have complied with the holding period requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nSales of a substantial number of such shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our stock price to decline or make it more difficult for the holders of our Class A common stock to sell at a time and price that they deem appropriate.\nHolders of more than 90% of our Class B common stock have contractual rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of their Class B common stock, or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with descendants of the family of Levi Strauss, who have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class B common stock, which is entitled to ten votes per share, is primarily owned by descendants of the family of our founder, Levi Strauss, and their relatives and trusts established for their behalf. Collectively, these persons have the ability to control the outcome of stockholder votes, including the election of our board of directors and the approval or rejection of a merger, change of control or other significant corporate transaction. In addition, so long as any shares of Class B common stock remain outstanding, the approval of the holders of a majority of our then-outstanding Class B common stock (or, in certain cases, a majority of our then-outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single class) will be required in order for us to take certain actions.\nThis control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have recently announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500. These changes exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to such indices. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices and may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe believe having a long-term-focused, committed and engaged stockholder base provides us with an important strategic advantage, particularly in our business, where our more than 165-year history contributes to the iconic reputations of our brands. However, the interests of these stockholders may not always be aligned with each other or with the interests of our other stockholders. By exercising their control, these stockholders could cause our company to take actions that are at odds with the investment goals or interests of institutional, short-term or other non-controlling investors, or that have a negative effect on our stock price. Further, because these stockholders control the majority of our Class B common stock, we might be a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our Class A common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nFuture securities issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders and impair the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture issuances of our Class A common stock or the conversion of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock, or the perception that these issuances or conversions may occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and result in dilution to existing holders of our Class A common stock. Also, to the extent stock-based awards\nare issued or become vested, there will be further dilution. The amount of dilution could be substantial depending upon the size of the issuances or exercises. Furthermore, we may issue additional equity securities that could have rights senior to those of our Class A common stock. As a result, purchasers of Class A common stock bear the risk that future issuances of debt or equity securities may reduce the value of such shares and further dilute their ownership interest.\nAs of November 28, 2021, there were 7,775,666 shares of Class A common stock and 7,798,702 shares of Class B common stock issuable pursuant to restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance restricted stock units (\"PRSUs\") and stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\") that may be settled in shares of our Class A or Class B common stock. All of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise or settlement of such awards, or upon the conversion of shares of Class B common stock issuable upon exercise or settlement of such awards, are registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, and subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.\nHolders of more than 90% of our Class B common stock have contractual rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of their Class B common stock, or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, result in more litigation and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company we are subject to the additional reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Complying with these rules and regulations involves significant legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and puts significant demand on our systems and resources. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nThese new rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and, in the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nBy disclosing information in the various filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If those claims are successful, our business could be seriously harmed. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources needed to resolve them could divert our management\u2019s resources and seriously harm our business.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. In particular, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors so that not all members are elected at one time;\n\u2022permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware or to Federal court;\n\u2022reflect the dual class structure of our common stock; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws together designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nIn addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 18424, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "LEVI"}
