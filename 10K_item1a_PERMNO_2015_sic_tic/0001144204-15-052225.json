{"cik": "730464", "company": "DEVRY EDUCATION GROUP INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nDeVry Group\u2019s business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Investors should carefully consider the risk factors described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision with respect to DeVry Group\u2019s common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, DeVry Group\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and as a result, the price of DeVry Group\u2019s common stock could be materially and adversely impacted. Because of their very nature, management cannot predict all the possible risks and uncertainties that may arise. Risks and uncertainties that may affect DeVry Group\u2019s business include, but are not limited to:\nRisks Related to DeVry Group\u2019s Highly Regulated Industry\nIf any regulatory audit, investigation or other proceeding finds us not in compliance with the numerous laws and regulations applicable to the postsecondary education industry, we may not be able to successfully challenge such finding and our business could suffer.\nDue to the highly regulated nature of the proprietary postsecondary institutions, we are subject to audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, complaints, investigations, claims of non-compliance and lawsuits by federal and state governmental agencies, regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, present and former students and employees, shareholders and other third parties, any of whom may allege violations of any of the regulatory requirements applicable to us. If the results of any such claims or actions are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay monetary fines or penalties, be required to repay funds received under Title IV programs or state financial aid programs, have restrictions placed on or terminate our schools\u2019 or programs\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or state financial aid programs, have limitations placed on or terminate our schools\u2019 operations or ability to grant degrees and certificates, have our schools\u2019 accreditations restricted or revoked, or be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Any one of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nA coordinated regulatory and enforcement effort aimed at for-profit institutions of higher education could be a catalyst for legislative or regulatory restrictions, investigations, enforcement actions, and claims that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nThe industry is experiencing broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of coordinated investigations and enforcement actions. In October 2014, the U.S. Department of Education (\u201cED\u201d) announced it will be leading an interagency task force (the \u201cTask Force\u201d), formalizing a task force that had been operating for over a year in connection with several investigations. The Task Force is comprised of ED, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), the U.S. Departments of Justice, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), and numerous state attorneys general. The stated purpose of the Task Force is to \u201ccoordinate \u2026 activities and promote information sharing to protect students from unfair, deceptive, and abusive policies and practices.\u201d Various federal agencies, including the CFPB, the SEC, and the FTC, are actively investigating or suing members of the sector, and at least 30 state attorneys general have joined an examination of potential abuses within the for-profit education industry.\nAs described in Part I, Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d the FTC and state attorneys general from Illinois, New York and Massachusetts have initiated inquiries into the practices of our institutions. The coordinated scrutiny facing the industry could directly or indirectly influence the disposition of these existing inquiries or lead to the initiation of other inquiries or claims, which could, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nAdverse publicity arising from investigations, claims or actions brought against us or other proprietary higher education institutions may negatively affect our reputation, business or stock price, or attract additional investigations, lawsuits or regulatory action, which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nAdverse publicity regarding any pending or future investigations, claims and/or actions against us or other proprietary institutions could negatively affect our reputation, business and/or the market price of our common stock. Unresolved investigations, claims and actions, or adverse resolutions thereof, could also result in additional lawsuits, increased scrutiny, the withholding of authorizations and/or the imposition of other sanctions by state education and professional licensing authorities, taxing authorities, our accreditors and other regulatory agencies governing us, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties have initiated, and could initiate additional investigations, claims or actions against us, which could require us to pay monetary damages, halt certain business practices or receive other sanctions. The defense and resolution of these matters could require us to expend significant resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nAs described in Part I, Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d the FTC and state attorneys general from Illinois, New York and Massachusetts have initiated inquiries into the practices of our institutions. Due to the coordinated regulatory and enforcement efforts directed at us and other for-profit higher education institutions and adverse publicity arising from such efforts, we may face additional government and regulatory investigations and actions as well as lawsuits from private plaintiffs. We may incur significant costs and other expenses in connection with our response to, and defense and resolution of, investigations, claims or actions, or group of related investigations, claims or actions, which, individually or in the aggregate, could be outside the scope of, or in excess of, our existing insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As part of our resolution of any such matter, or group of related matters, we may be required to comply with certain injunctive relief, including altering certain business practices or requiring us to pay substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and/or penalties. In addition, findings or claims or settlements thereof could serve as a basis for additional lawsuits or governmental inquiries or enforcement actions. Such actions, individually or combined with other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, an adverse allegation, finding or outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain, obtain or renew licenses, approvals or accreditation and maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or serve as a basis for ED to discharge certain Title IV student loans and seek recovery for some or all of its resulting losses from us, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nWe are subject to risks relating to regulatory matters. If we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our operations, we could face fines and penalties, including loss of access to federal and state student financial aid for our students as well as significant civil liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nAs a provider of higher education, we are subject to extensive regulation. These regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases and aspects of our U.S. postsecondary operations, including educational program offerings, facilities, civil rights, safety, privacy, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, payment of refunds to students who withdraw, acquisitions or openings of new schools or programs, addition of new educational programs and changes in our corporate structure and ownership.\nIn particular, in the United States, the Higher Education Act, as amended and reauthorized (the \u201cHigher Education Act\u201d), subjects our U.S. degree granting institutions (DeVry University, Chamberlain College of Nursing and Carrington College) and all other higher education institutions, including our Ross University School of Medicine, Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine and American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine, that participate in the various federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (\u201cTitle IV\u201d) to significant regulatory scrutiny.\nTo participate in Title IV financial aid programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the ED, and be certified by ED as an eligible institution, which ultimately is accomplished through the execution of a Program Participation Agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d).\nOur institutions that participate in Title IV programs each do so pursuant to a PPA that, among other things, includes commitments to abide by all applicable laws and regulations, such as the Incentive Compensation, Substantial Misrepresentation, and Gainful Employment (\u201cGE\u201d) regulations. Alleged violations of such laws or regulations may form the basis of civil actions for violation of state and/or federal false claims statutes predicated on violations of a PPA, including pursuant to qui tam actions, that have the potential to generate very significant damages linked to our receipt of Title IV funding from the government over a period of several years.\nOn October 31, 2014, the ED published new GE regulations impacting programs required to prepare graduates for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Almost all academic programs offered by Title IV-participating private sector institutions of higher education must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The new GE regulations were effective July 1, 2015.\nThe new GE regulations have a framework with three components:\nCertification: Institutions must certify that each of their gainful employment programs meet state and federal licensure, certification, and accreditation requirements.\nAccountability Measures: To maintain Title IV eligibility, gainful employment programs will be required to meet minimum standards for the debt burden versus the earnings of their graduates.\nPass: Programs whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden of less than 8% of total earnings or less than 20% of discretionary earnings.\nZone: Programs whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden between 8% and 12% of total earnings or between 20% and 30% of discretionary earnings.\nFail: Programs whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden greater than 12% of total earnings and greater than 30% of discretionary earnings.\nPrograms that fail in two out of any three consecutive years or are in the Zone for four consecutive years will be disqualified from participation in the Title IV programs.\nTransparency: Institutions will be required to make public disclosures regarding the performance and outcomes of their gainful employment programs. The disclosures will include information such as costs, earnings, debt and completion rates.\nThe accountability measures will typically weigh a calculated debt burden from graduates who completed their studies three and four years prior to the measuring academic year and earnings from the most recent calendar year prior to the conclusion of the measuring academic year. Thus for the 2014-2015 academic year (the first measurement year under these regulations), the cohort will include graduates from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years and earnings for these graduates from calendar year 2014, which are not available at this time. Debt burdens for students enrolled in programs that require an internship or residency prior to licensure, such as the medical doctor degrees offered by AUC and RUSM, are calculated from cohorts who completed their studies six and seven years prior to the measuring academic year. Draft measures for the 2014-2015 academic year are expected to be released to the institutions in Summer 2016 and final measures released publicly in early 2017.\nBecause the information necessary to determine how its programs will fare under the accountability measures is not available at this time, we are unable to fully predict accurately the impact of the new GE regulations in the future when they do become effective. The regulations contemplate a transition period in the first several years to afford institutions the opportunity to make changes to their programs and retain Title IV eligibility. We are using currently-available data to evaluate whether certain of our programs are at risk to fail the new requirements, or fall into the Zone, and concurrently evaluating available options to bring at-risk programs into compliance.\nUnder this framework, we believe that less than 10% of the 2014-2015 academic year programs across DeVry University and Carrington are at risk of falling into the Fail category. In addition, there are a number of programs that are at risk of falling into the Zone category, including the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine\u2019s Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Program. Management expects that certain programs will be able to avoid falling into the Zone or Fail categories through adjustments to program price, including through scholarships, or, if appropriate and consistent with programmatic standards, the duration of programs. If such adjustments are necessary, we estimate the cost would be in the $5 million range for fiscal year 2016. For programs where such adjustments are not feasible, we may discontinue such programs or seek to establish relationships with third-party lenders to support student tuition and other expenses. These adjustments could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nOn August 20, 2015, the ED announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations (collectively, the \u201cDebt Forgiveness Regulations\u201d) for determining the criteria and procedures ED will use for determining which Title IV borrower obligations to forgive, and standards and processes to be applied in determining whether institutions whose acts serve as the basis of such debt forgiveness are liable. The committee will also propose rules to determine the effect of borrower defenses to loan repayment may have on ED\u2019s assessment of institutional capability assessments. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this rulemaking process or how any such resulting rules would be enforced. Should ED adopt rules proposed by the negotiated rulemaking committee, or rules in furtherance of the objectives of the rulemaking committee, they may include rules that serve as a basis for recovery of losses arising from loan forgiveness from Title IV participating institutions. Depending on the processes and standards adopted by ED in the Debt Forgiveness Regulations, which we cannot predict at this time, in addition to the outcome from any legal proceeding instituted by a private party or governmental authority, facts asserted in pending or future lawsuits or the outcome of any pending or future governmental inquiry, lawsuit or enforcement action could collaterally serve as the basis for claim by ED under the Debt Forgiveness Regulations or the termination of eligibility to participate in the Title IV program based on ED\u2019s institutional capability assessment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nThe U.S. Congress may change laws governing federal financial aid programs in ways that could materially impact our financial condition, operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nAction by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing the federal student financial aid programs or reduce funding for those programs could reduce DeVry Group\u2019s student enrollments and/or increase its costs of operation. Political and budgetary concerns significantly affect Title IV Programs. The U.S. Congress enacted the Higher Education Act to be reauthorized on a periodic basis, which most recently occurred in August 2008. The 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act made significant changes to the requirements governing the Title IV Programs, including changes that, among other things:\n\u00b7 Regulated non-federal, private education loans;\n\u00b7 Regulated the relationship between institutions and lenders that make education loans;\n\u00b7 Revised the calculation of the student default rate attributed to an institution and the threshold rate at which sanctions will be imposed against an institution (as discussed above);\n\u00b7 Adjusted the types of revenue that an institution is deemed to have derived from Title IV Programs and the sanctions imposed on an institution that derives too much revenue from Title IV Programs;\n\u00b7 Increased the types and amount of information that an institution must disclose to current and prospective students and the public; and\n\u00b7 Increased the types of policies and practices that an institution must adopt and follow.\nThe reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (\u201cHEA\u201d) is scheduled to expire at the end of September 2015. Committee leadership of both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have begun reauthorization hearings. Existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change in this process. Additionally, funding for the student financial assistance programs may be impacted during appropriations and budget actions.\nThe U.S. Congress can change the laws affecting Title IV Programs in the annual federal appropriations bills and other laws it enacts between the HEA reauthorizations. At this time, DeVry Group cannot predict all of the changes that the U.S. Congress will ultimately make. Since a significant percentage of DeVry Group\u2019s revenue is indirectly derived from Title IV Programs, any action by the U.S. Congress that significantly reduces Title IV Program funding or the ability of DeVry Group\u2019s degree granting institutions or students to participate in Title IV Programs could have a material adverse effect on DeVry Group\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Recently proposed legislation that, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our business includes:\n\u00b7 Inclusion of sources of federal student assistance or funding other than Title IV aid in the 90/10 formula and increasing the 10% requirement to 15%,\n\u00b7 Limitations on the enrollment of U. S. citizens in foreign medical schools,\n\u00b7 Sharing of cost of defaulted federal student loans,\n\u00b7 Extending Title IV eligibility to low-cost, non-traditional, non-accredited programs.\nOur ability to comply with some of regulations of the Department of Education is affected by economic forces affecting our students and graduates that are not entirely within our control.\nOur ability to comply with several regulations of ED is not entirely within our control. In particular, our ability to participate in federal Title IV programs is dependent on the ability of our past students to avoid default on student loans, obtain gainful employment, and to pay for a portion of their education with private funds. These measurements are heavily influenced by broader economic drivers, including the personal or family wealth of our students, the overall employment outlook for their area of study and the availability of private financing sources. An economic downturn, or a worsening economic outlook, could impact these measurements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nDepartment of Education rules prohibiting \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d are very broad. As a result, we face increased exposure to litigation arising from student and prospective student complaints and enforcement actions by the Department of Education that could restrict or eliminate our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nThe ED rules and internal guidance impose liability for \"substantial misrepresentation\" that, among other things, subject us to sanctions for statements containing inadvertent errors made to non-students, including any member of the public, impose vicarious liability on us for the conduct of others, and expose us to liability even when no actual harm occurs. It is possible that despite our efforts to prevent such misrepresentations, our employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. As a result, we may face complaints from students and prospective students over statements made by us and our agents throughout the enrollment, admissions and financial aid process, as well as throughout attendance at any of our U.S. degree granting schools, which would expose us to increased risk of enforcement action and applicable sanctions or other penalties and increased risk of private qui tam actions under the Federal False Claims Act. If ED determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may discharge students\u2019 debt and hold the institution liable for the discharged debt, revoke an institution\u2019s agreement to participate in Title IV programs, impose limitations on the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs, deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters, or initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If ED determines that statements made by us or on our behalf are in violation of the regulations, we could be subject to sanctions and other liability, which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nRegulations governing the eligibility of our U.S. degree-granting institutions to participate in Title IV programs preclude us from compensating any employee or third-party involved in student recruitment, admissions or finance based on their success in those areas. These regulations could limit our ability to attract and retain highly-qualified employees, to sustain and grow our business, or to develop or acquire businesses that would not otherwise be subject to such regulations.\nAn educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. Our limited ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. The regulations may also impair our ability to sustain and grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, guidance from ED indicates that these regulations would apply to services that we may provide to enable other educational institutions to offer online educational programs. These restrictions could materially restrict our ability to provide services competitive with other companies that provide, or will provide, online services to educational institutions without restrictions on incentive compensation.\nA failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nAll Title IV participating institutions are subject to meeting financial and administrative standards. These standards are assessed through annual compliance audits, quadrennial renewal of institutional program participation agreements, periodic program reviews and ad hoc events which may lead ED to evaluate an institution\u2019s capacities. If ED determines that we have failed to demonstrate either financial responsibility or administrative capability, we could be subject to sanctions including; a requirement to post a letter of credit, fines, suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, any of, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nStudent loan defaults could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nOur U.S. degree-granting institutions may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their student loan default rates are greater than standards set by ED. An educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs, if, for three consecutive federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant federal fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next two federal fiscal years. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if its default rate for a federal fiscal year was greater than 40%. If any of our U.S. degree granting institutions lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because of high student loan default rates, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nOur schools could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs were too high.\nOur U.S. degree granting institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, on a cash basis, the percentage of the institution\u2019s revenue derived from Title IV programs for two consecutive fiscal years is greater than 90%. If any of our U.S. degree granting institutions lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because it is unable to comply with ED\u2019s 90/10 Rule, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nOur failure to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s credit hour rule could result in sanctions and other liability.\nIn 2009 and 2010, ED\u2019s Office of Inspector General criticized three accreditors, including the Higher Learning Commission, which is the accreditor for DeVry University and Chamberlain College of Nursing, for deficiency in their oversight of institutions\u2019 credit hour allocations. In June 2010 the House Education and Labor Committee held a hearing concerning accrediting agencies\u2019 standards for assessing institutions\u2019 credit hour policies. The 2010 Program Integrity Regulations defined the term \u201ccredit hour\u201d for the first time and require accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution\u2019s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor does not comply with this requirement, its recognition by ED could be jeopardized. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution\u2019s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If ED determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, ED could impose liabilities or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nIf we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation or if our institutional accrediting body loses recognition by the Department of Education, we would lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nThe loss of accreditation by any of our schools would leave the affected school ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. In addition, an adverse action by any of our accreditors, other than loss of accreditation, such as issuance of a warning, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Increased scrutiny of accreditors by the Secretary of Education in connection with ED\u2019s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accreditors or have other consequences.\nIf we fail to maintain any of our state authorizations, we would lose our ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs there.\nInstitutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution is located. Campuses of our U.S. degree-granting institutions are authorized to operate and to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates by the applicable education agency of the state where each such campus is located. We are in a time period where many states are reevaluating and revising their authorization regulations, especially as applied to distance education. The loss of state authorization would, among other things, render the affected school ineligible to participate in Title IV programs at least at those state campus locations, limit that school\u2019s ability to operate in that state. Loss of authorization in one or more states could increase the likelihood of additional scrutiny and potential loss of operating and/or degree granting authority in other states in which we operate, which would further impact our business. If these pressures and uncertainty continue in the future, or if one or more of our institutions are unable to offer programs in one or more states, it could have a material adverse impact on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nOur ability to place our medical schools students in hospitals in the U.S. may be limited by efforts of certain state government regulatory bodies, which may limit the growth potential of our medical schools, put our medical schools at a competitive disadvantage to other medical schools, or force our medical schools to substantially reduce their class sizes.\nEach of American University School of the Caribbean and Ross University School of Medicine enter into affiliation agreements with hospitals across the U.S. to place their third and fourth year students in clinical programs at such hospitals. Certain states with regulatory programs that require state approval of clinical education programs clinical education programs have in recent years precluded, limited or imposed onerous requirements on DeVry Group\u2019s entry into affiliation agreements with hospitals in their states. If these or other states continue to limit access to affiliation arrangements, our medical schools may be at a competitive disadvantage to other medical schools and our medical schools may be required to substantially restrict their enrollments due to limited clinical opportunities for enrolled students. The impact on enrollment, and the potential for enrollment growth, of such restrictions on our medical schools\u2019 clinical placements could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial conditions, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nBudget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce the amount of such financial aid that is available to our students, which could reduce our enrollment and adversely affect our 90/10 Rule percentage.\nSome states are experiencing budget deficits and constraints. Some of these states have reduced or eliminated various student financial assistance programs or established minimum performance measures as a condition of participation, and additional states may do so in the future. If our students who receive this type of assistance cannot secure alternate sources of funding, they may be forced to withdraw, reduce the rate at which they seek to complete their education, or replace the source with more expensive forms of funding such as private loans which will have a negative impact on debt measurements such as the Gainful Employment disclosures and the cohort default rate. Other students who would otherwise have been eligible for state financial assistance may not be able to enroll without such aid. This reduced funding could decrease our enrollment and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the reduction or elimination of these non-Title IV sources of student funding may adversely affect our 90/10 measurement.\nWe are subject to sanctions if we fail to calculate accurately and make timely payment of refunds of Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nThe Higher Education Act and ED regulations require us to calculate refunds of unearned Title IV program funds disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational program. If refunds are not properly calculated or timely paid, we may be required to post a letter of credit with ED or be subject to sanctions or other adverse actions by ED, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nA failure of our vendors to comply with applicable regulations in the servicing of our students and institutions could subject us to fines or restrictions on or loss of our ability to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect our enrollment, revenue and results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nWe contract with unaffiliated entities for student software systems and services related to the administration of portions of our Title IV and institutional loan programs. Because each of our schools is jointly and severally liable for the actions of third-party servicers and vendors, failure of such servicers to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our schools, including fines and the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, revenue and results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. If any of the third party servicers discontinue providing such services to us, we may not be able to replace them in a timely, cost-efficient, or effective manner, or at all, and we could lose our ability to comply with collection, lending and Title IV requirements, which could have a material adverse effect our enrollment, revenue and results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nWe provide financing programs to assist some of our students in affording our educational offerings. These programs are subject to various federal and state rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge loans and other injunctive requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nIf we, or one of the companies that service our loans, do not comply with laws applicable to the financing programs that assist our students in affording our educational offerings, including Truth in Lending and Fair Debt Collections Practices laws and the Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, we could be subject to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge loans and other injunctive requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, an adverse allegation, finding or outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain, obtain or renew licenses, approvals or accreditation and maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or serve as a basis for ED to discharge certain Title IV student loans and seek recovery for some or all of its resulting losses from us, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate..\nRelease of confidential information could subject us to civil penalties or cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nAs an educational institution participating in federal and state student assistance programs and collecting financial receipts from enrollees or their sponsors, we collect and retain certain confidential information. Such information is subject to federal and state privacy and security rules, including the Family Education Right to Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. Release or failure to secure confidential information or other non-compliance with these rules could subject us to fines, loss of our capacity to conduct electronic commerce and loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nWe are subject to sanctions if we fail to accurately and timely report sponsored students\u2019 tuition, fees and enrollments to the sponsoring agency.\nA significant portion of our enrollment is sponsored through various federal and state supported agencies and programs, including the U. S. Departments of Defense, Labor and Veterans Administration. We are required to periodically report tuition, fees and enrollment to the sponsoring agencies. As a recipient of funds, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits. Inaccurate or untimely reporting could result in suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in these federal and state programs and have a material adverse impact on enrollments and revenues.\nDeVry Group\u2019s enrollment may be adversely affected by presentations of data that are not representative of actual educational costs for our prospective students.\nED and other public policy organizations are concerned with the escalating costs of higher education and have developed various tools and resources to help students find low-cost educational alternatives. These resources primarily rely on and present data for first-time, full-time residential students, which is not representative of most prospective DeVry Group students. These presentations may influence some prospective students to exclude DeVry Group institutions from their consideration.\nRestrictions or limitations on the government-supported student loan and scholarship programs in Brazil could have a material and adverse impact on DeVry Brasil\u2019s ability to attract and retain students and execute its plans for organic and inorganic growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nDeVry Brasil students are eligible for loans under Brazil\u2019s FIES public loan program (\u201cFundo de Financiamento Estudantil\u201d or \u201cStudents Financing Fund\u201d), which is financed by the Brazilian government. DeVry Brasil also participates in PROUNI (\u201cPrograma Universidade para Todos\u201d or \u201cUniversity for All Program\u201d), a Brazilian governmental program which provides scholarships to a portion of its undergraduate students under certain conditions. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 40% of DeVry Brasil\u2019s students financed their education under the FIES program while approximately 11% have obtained scholarships under the PROUNI program. Without prior notice, during fiscal year 2015, the Brazilian government enacted changes to the FIES regulations limiting student eligibility for FIES funding and extending the government\u2019s time to disburse funding to participating institutions. Restrictions or limitations on the FIES public loan program or student scholarships under PROUNI program, could have a material and adverse impact on DeVry Brasil\u2019s ability to attract and retain students and execute its plans for organic and inorganic growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nRisks Related to DeVry Group\u2019s Business\nStudent enrollment at our schools is affected by legislative, regulatory and economic factors that may change in ways we cannot predict. These factors outside our control limit our ability to assess our future enrollments effectively.\nDeVry Group\u2019s future revenue and growth depends on a number of factors, including many of the regulatory risks discussed above and business risks discussed below. DeVry University and Carrington College have experienced reduced new student enrollments in recent periods. Despite ongoing efforts to provide more scholarships to prospective students, and to increase quality and build our reputation, negative perceptions of the value of a college degree, increased reluctance to take on debt and the resulting lower student consumer confidence may continue to impact enrollment in the future. In addition, technological innovations in the delivery of low-cost education alternatives and increased competition continue to negatively affect enrollments. Until legislative, regulatory, and market uncertainty are resolved, it may be difficult to assess whether and to what extent there is an impact on our long-term revenue and growth prospects.\nDeVry Group is subject to risks relating to enrollment of students. If DeVry Group is not able to continue to successfully recruit and retain its students, it will not be able to sustain or grow revenues.\nDeVry Group\u2019s undergraduate and graduate educational programs are concentrated in selected areas of technology, healthcare, law and business. If applicant career interests shift away from these fields, and we do not anticipate or adequately respond to that trend, future enrollment and revenue may decline.\nIf our graduates are unable to find appropriate employment opportunities, we may not be able to recruit new students.\nIf employment opportunities for DeVry Group graduates in fields related to their educational programs decline, future enrollment and revenue may decline as potential applicants choose to enroll at other educational institutions or providers offering different courses of study.\nWe face heightened competition in the postsecondary education market from both public and private educational institutions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nPostsecondary education in our existing and new market areas is highly competitive and is becoming increasingly so. We compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges, other proprietary schools and alternatives to higher education. Some of our competitors, both public and private, have greater financial and nonfinancial resources than we have. Some of our competitors, both public and private, are able to offer programs similar to ours at a lower tuition level for a variety of reasons, including the availability of direct and indirect government subsidies, government and foundation grants, large endowments, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources not available to proprietary institutions, or by providing fewer student services or larger class sizes. An increasing number of traditional colleges and community colleges are offering distance learning and other online education programs, including programs that are geared towards the needs of working adults. This trend has been accelerated by private companies that provide and/or manage online learning platforms for traditional colleges and community colleges. As the proportion of traditional colleges providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increasing competition for students from traditional colleges, including colleges with well-established reputations for excellence. As the online and distance learning segment of the postsecondary education market matures, we believe that the intensity of the competition we face will continue to increase. This intense competition could make it more challenging for us to enroll students who are likely to succeed in our educational programs, which could adversely affect our enrollment levels and student persistence and put downward pressure on our tuition rates, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our colleagues in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Confidential information also may become available to third parties inadvertently when we integrate or convert computer networks into our network following an acquisition of a school or in connection with upgrades from time to time.\nDue to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks, such as students\u2019 grades, our networks may be targeted by hackers. Anyone who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. We cannot assure that a breach, loss or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by federal or state authorities and private litigants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA failure in our computer network or information systems could severely impact our ability to serve our existing students and attract new students.\nThe performance and reliability of our computer networks and system applications, especially online educational platforms and student operational and financial aid packaging applications, are critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. System errors and/or failures could adversely impact DeVry Group\u2019s delivery of educational content to its online students. In addition, system errors could result in delays and/or errors in processing student financial aid and related disbursements. There is no assurance that we would be able to enhance/expand our computer networks and system applications to meet increased demand and future information requirements.\nGovernment regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to grow.\nThe use of the internet and other online services has led to and may lead to further adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the U.S. or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, value-added taxes, withholding taxes, allocation and apportionment of income amongst various state, local and foreign jurisdictions, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNatural disasters or other extraordinary events or political disruptions outside the United States may cause us to close some of our schools.\nDeVry Group may experience business interruptions resulting from natural disasters, inclement weather, transit disruptions, political disruptions or other events in one or more of the geographic areas in which it operates, particularly in the West Coast and Gulf States of the U.S., in the Caribbean and in Brazil. These events could cause DeVry Group to close schools - temporarily or permanently - and could affect student recruiting opportunities in those locations, causing enrollment and revenues to decline.\nDeVry Group\u2019s ability to open new campuses, offer new programs, and add capacity is dependent on regulatory approvals and requires financial and human resources.\nAs part of its strategy, DeVry Group intends to open new campuses, offer new educational programs and add capacity to some existing locations. Such actions require DeVry Group to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals. In addition, adding new locations, programs and capacity may require significant financial investments and human resource capabilities. The failure to obtain appropriate approvals or not properly allocate financial and human capital would adversely impact DeVry Group\u2019s future growth.\nDeVry Group\u2019s ability to consolidate and close campuses and reduce programs may be dependent on regulatory approvals and requires financial and human resources.\nAs part of its strategy, DeVry Group may consolidate or close DeVry University campuses, or reduce educational programs at some of its campuses. Such actions may require DeVry Group to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals. In addition, consolidating locations and programs may require significant financial and human capital investments to teach out current students. The failure to obtain appropriate approvals or not properly allocate financial and human capital would adversely impact DeVry Group\u2019s ability to align its cost structure with enrollment levels.\nWe may not be able to attract, retain and develop key employees necessary for our operations and the successful execution of our strategic plans.\nDeVry Group may be unable to attract, retain and develop key employees with appropriate educational qualifications and experience. In addition, DeVry Group may be unable to effectively plan and prepare for changes in key employees. Such matters may cause DeVry Group to incur higher wage expense and/or provide less student support and customer service which could adversely affect enrollment, revenues and expense. A significant amount of our compensation for key employees is tied to our financial performance. Recent financial results have resulted in lower compensation payments under our Management Incentive Plan and lower returns on grants under our Long Term Incentive Plan for many of our key employees, which may make it more difficult for DeVry Group to retain such employees. We may require new employees in order to execute some of our strategic plans. Uncertainty regarding our future financial performance may limit our ability to attract new employees with competitive compensation or increase our cost of recruiting and retaining such new employees.\nDeVry Group may not be able to successfully identify, pursue or integrate acquisitions.\nAs part of its strategy, DeVry Group is actively considering acquisition opportunities in the U.S. and worldwide. DeVry Group has acquired and expects to acquire additional educational institutions or education related businesses that complement our strategic direction, some of which could be material to our operations. Any acquisition involves significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 Inability to successfully integrate the acquired operations into our institutions and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u00b7 Issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including commitments and/or contingencies; and\n\u00b7 Financial commitments, investments in foreign countries, and compliance with debt covenants and ED financial responsibility scores.\nProposed changes in, or lapses of, U.S. tax laws regarding earnings from international operations could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur effective tax rate could be subject to volatility or adversely impacted by changes to federal tax laws governing the taxation of foreign earnings of U.S. based companies. DeVry Group\u2019s effective income tax rate reflects benefits derived from operations outside the United States. Earnings of DeVry Group\u2019s international operations are not subject to U.S. federal income taxes as described in Note 11, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If such federal tax laws were changed and some of DeVry Group\u2019s international earnings were subject to federal income tax, or if certain of DeVry Group\u2019s U.S. expenses were not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, DeVry Group\u2019s effective income tax rate would increase and its earnings and cash flows would be adversely impacted. In addition, DeVry Group has benefitted from the ability to enter into international intercompany arrangements without incurring U.S. taxation due to a law, which expired in fiscal year 2015, deferring U.S. taxation of \u201cforeign personal holding company income\u201d such as foreign income from dividends, interest, rents and royalties. If this law is not extended, or a similar law adopted, our consolidated tax provision, beginning in our fiscal year 2016, would be impacted and we may not be able to allocate international capital optimally without realizing U.S. income taxes, which would increase our effective income tax rate and adversely impact our earnings and cash flows.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by: earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in various tax provisions; by tax effects of stock-based compensation; by costs related to intercompany or other restructurings; or by changes in tax rates, laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we have accrued tax and related interest for potential adjustments to tax liabilities for prior years, there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have a material effect, either positive or negative, on our business, financial condition and results of operation\nDeVry Group may experience movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs DeVry Group expands internationally, DeVry Group will conduct more transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The volume of transactions in the various foreign currencies could continue to increase, thus increasing DeVry Group\u2019s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The financial position and results of operations of DeVry Group\u2019s investment in DeVry Brasil are measured using the Brazilian Real as the functional currency. Brazilian-based assets constitute a material portion of DeVry Group\u2019s overall assets, and its Brazilian liabilities constitute a material portion of our overall liabilities. Significant devaluations in the Brazilian Real will result in a significant devaluation in relation to the U.S. dollar. In fiscal year 2015, changes in exchange rates resulted in a $60.6 million charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss over that time period. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nExpansion into new international markets will subject DeVry Group to risks inherent in international operations.\nAs part of its strategy, DeVry Group has acquired and intends to acquire or establish additional educational operations outside of the United States. To the extent that DeVry Group expands internationally, DeVry Group will face risks that are inherent in international operations including:\n\u00b7 Compliance with foreign regulatory environments;\n\u00b7 Management of internal operations;\n\u00b7 Currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 Monetary policy risks, such as inflation, hyperinflation and deflation;\n\u00b7 Price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies;\n\u00b7 Political and economic instability in the countries in which DeVry Group operates;\n\u00b7 Potential unionization of employees under local labor laws;\n\u00b7 Multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws;\n\u00b7 Inability to repatriate cash balances; and\n\u00b7 Compliance with United States regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nDeVry Group\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets could potentially be impaired if our business results and financial condition were materially and adversely impacted by the risks and uncertainties.\nAt June 30, 2015, intangible assets from business combinations totaled $323.7 million, and goodwill totaled $552.3 million. Together, these assets equaled approximately 42% of total assets as of such date. If DeVry Group\u2019s business results and financial condition were materially and adversely impacted, then such goodwill and intangible assets could be impaired, requiring possible write-off of up to $323.7 million of intangible assets and up to $552.3 million of goodwill.", "PERMNO": 76708, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "ATGE"}
