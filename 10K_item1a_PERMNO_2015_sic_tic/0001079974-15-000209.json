{"cik": "890821", "company": "SPATIALIZER AUDIO LABORATORIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe Company Has No Means to Generate Revenue\nWe have no source of revenue. Our cash balance has been diminished by general and administrative expenses. We do not expect to generate any revenues until, and we will only potentially generate revenues if, we enter into a new business. We believe that we may need additional financing to pay accounting and professional fees and other expenses to fulfill our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") until we commence business operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the stockholders. In addition, our failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay the accounting and other fees required in order to continue to fulfill our reporting obligations and pursue our business plan. We do not have any arrangements with any bank or financial institution to secure additional financing and there can be no assurance that any such arrangement would be available at all or on terms acceptable to us.\n- 2 -\nThe Market For Our Stock Is Not Liquid And The Stock Price Is Subject To Volatility\nOur stock is quoted on the OTCQB of the OTC Marketplace under the symbol of \"SPZR\", where low trading volume and high volatility is often experienced. While a few firms make a market in our stock, the historically low trading volume and relatively few market makers of our stock make it more likely that a severe fluctuation in volume, either up or down, will significantly impact the stock price. There can be no assurance that these market makers will continue to quote our stock and a reduction in such market makers would negatively impact trading liquidity. Further, with our constrained resources and increased cost and time associated with implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley, it may not be possible for us to remain listed on the OTC Bulletin Board in the future as a fully reporting company. Lastly, the uncertainty of the future of the Company may limit the liquidity of our stock. This and the existing limited market and volume in the trading of our stock, may result in our stockholders having difficulty selling our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations due to the uncertainty of the future of the Company, general market fluctuations and other events and factors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nOur management will have broad discretion in connection with the selection of a business combination.\nAny person who invests in our securities will do so without an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any potential business combination in which we may engage. As a result, investors will be entirely dependent on the broad discretion and judgment of management in connection with the selection of a business combination. There can be no assurance that determinations made by the acting management will permit us to achieve our business objectives.\nSince we have not yet selected a particular industry or any target business with which to complete our business combination, stockholders will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate.\nThere is no basis for stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of potential business combinations or the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate. To the extent that we effect a business combination with a financially unstable entity or an entity that is in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of revenues or income, we will become subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of such entity. In addition, to the extent that we effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high degree of risk, we will become subject to the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. A high level of risk frequently characterizes certain industries that experience rapid growth. Although management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular new prospective business or industry, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all such risks or that subsequent events may not alter the risks that we perceive at the time of the consummation of a business combination.\nWe currently do not have any agreements nor any minimum requirements for a business combination.\nThe Company has no current arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a business combination with a specific entity. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying and evaluating or in concluding a business combination. No particular industry or specific business within an industry has been selected for a target company. The Company has not established a specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings, assets, net worth or other criteria that it will require a target company to have achieved, or without which the Company would not consider a business combination with such business entity. Accordingly, the Company may enter into a business combination with a business entity having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential for immediate earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative characteristics. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate a business combination on terms favorable to the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that a business combination will benefit stockholders or prove to be more favorable to stockholders than any other investment that may be made by stockholders and investors.\n- 3 -\nWe may have only limited ability to evaluate the management of the target business.\nWe may have only limited ability to evaluate the management of the target business. Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business in connection with evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of management will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company and the securities laws, which could increase the time and resources we must expend to assist them in becoming familiar with the complex disclosure and financial reporting requirements imposed on U.S. public companies, including the requirement to maintain an effective system of internal controls. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues that may adversely affect the price of our stock.\nReporting requirements may delay or preclude the consummation of a business combination.\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, the Company is required to provide certain information about significant acquisitions including audited financial statements of the acquired company. These audited financial statements must be furnished within 4 days following the effective date of a business combination. Obtaining audited financial statements are the economic responsibility of the target company. The additional time and costs that may be incurred by some potential target companies to prepare such financial statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the Company. Acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable.\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may vote their shares in a manner that is not in the best interest of other stockholders.\nOur principal stockholders control over 50% of the voting power represented by our outstanding shares of Common Stock and if these stockholders act together, they will be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs requiring stockholder approval, including approval of a business combination. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all our stockholders.\nOur officers and directors will allocate some portion of their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs.\nOur management is not required to commit its full time to our affairs. As a result, pursuing business combinations may require a greater period of time than if it would devote its full time to our affairs. Management is not precluded from serving as officers or directors of any other entity that is engaged in business activities similar to those of the Company. In the future, management may become associated or affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct. In such event, management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business combination should be presented. In cases where our management has multiple business affiliations, they may have similar legal obligations to present certain business opportunities to multiple entities. If several business opportunities or operating entities approach management with respect to a business combination, management will consider a number of factors, including preferences of the management of the operating company and availability of resources of the acquiring company. However, management will act in what it believes will be in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company and other respective public companies.\n- 4 -\nBecause of significant competition for business combination opportunities, including numerous companies with a business plan similar to ours, it may be more difficult for us to complete a business combination.\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our potential business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies and operating businesses seeking acquisitions. Many of these entities may be well established and may have extensive experience in identifying prospective business combinations. Many of these competitors may possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and there can be no assurance that we will have the ability to compete successfully. While we believe there are numerous potential target businesses with which we could enter into a business combination with, our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources.\nThere may be state blue-sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our securities.\nThe holders of our shares of common stock and those persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop should be aware that there may be state blue-sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our securities. Accordingly, investors should consider the secondary market for the Registrant's securities to be a limited one.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future because we have no revenues. The payment of dividends will be contingent upon our future revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and overall financial condition. The payment of any future dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors. It is our expectation that after the consummation of a business combination that future management will determine to retain any earnings for use in business operations and, accordingly, we do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThere may be a change in control and management of the Company in connection with a business combination.\nIn conjunction with completion of a business combination, it is anticipated that the Company will issue an amount of the Company's authorized but unissued common stock that represents a majority of the voting power and total capital stock of the Company, which will, in all likelihood, result in stockholders of a target company obtaining a controlling interest in the Company. As a condition of the business combination agreement, the current controlling stockholders of the Company may agree to sell or transfer all or a portion of the Company's common stock they own so as to provide the target company with all or majority control. The resulting change in control of the Company will likely result in removal of the present officer and directors of the Company and a corresponding reduction in or elimination of their participation in the future affairs of the Company.\nIssuance of additional shares of common stock in connection with a business combination may result in dilution of our common stock.\nA business combination normally will involve the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of common stock. Depending upon the value of the assets acquired in such business combination, the per share trading value of the Company's common stock may increase or decrease, perhaps significantly.\n- 5 -\nIt is possible that our business combination may not meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties may not obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets.\nFederal and state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be major considerations in any business combination that the Company may undertake. Currently, such transactions may be structured so as to result in tax-free treatment to both companies, pursuant to various federal and state tax provisions. The Company intends to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both the Company and the target entity; however, there can be no assurance that such business combination will meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes, which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction.\nIf we locate a suitable target business outside of the United States, we would be subject to all the inherent risks of doing business in that foreign country.\nAlthough we intend to focus our search on target businesses located within the United States, we are not limited to this geographical region. It is possible that prospective target businesses could be introduced to us in this and other areas. If we locate a suitable target business outside of the United States, we would be subject to all the inherent risks of doing business in that foreign country. For instance, many countries have had economic difficulties and political instability. If we were to complete a business combination with a target business located in another country, our operations and profitability could be negatively affected by that country's response to these and other issues. In addition, we cannot assure you that management of the target business will be familiar with United States securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with our laws, it may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.", "PERMNO": 82215, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AMRH"}
