In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the risks described below.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Substantial Indebtedness\n\u2022\nOur substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide on the indebtedness of the Bellagio BREIT Venture and the MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations.\n\u2022\nCurrent and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures.\n\u2022\nThe agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth initiatives, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\n\u2022\nAlthough all of our properties are open to the public, they are operating without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, and we are unable to predict the length of time it will take for our open properties to return to normal operations or if such properties will be required to close again due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022\nWe have undertaken aggressive actions to reduce costs and improve efficiencies to mitigate losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could negatively impact guest loyalty and our ability to attract and retain employees.\n\u2022\nWe face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside.\n\u2022\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives, including those associated with our MGM 2020 Plan.\n\u2022\nThe anticipated benefits of our asset light strategy, including the Bellagio sale-leaseback transaction and MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.\n\u2022\nOur ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements.\n\u2022\nNearly all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\n\u2022\nPaul Salem, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and Corey Sanders, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at MGP.\n\u2022\nDespite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions\ninvolving consideration in excess of $25 million, must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives.\n\u2022\nWe have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China.\n\u2022\nThe Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nMGM Grand Paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in Macau.\n\u2022\nThe future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to risks related to climate change.\n\u2022\nBecause a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified.\n\u2022\nWe extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables.\n\u2022\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits.\n\u2022\nLeisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases.\n\u2022\nCo-investing in our properties, including our investments in CityCenter and BetMGM, decreases our ability to manage risk.\n\u2022\nAny of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects.\n\u2022\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future.\n\u2022\nAny failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\n\u2022\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.\n\u2022\nWe face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us.\n\u2022\nA significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\u2022\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\n\u2022\nThe failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.\n\u2022\nWe may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful.\n\u2022\nIf the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nConflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, the holding company for MGM Grand Paradise which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below.\nRisks Relating to Our Substantial Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of the Bellagio BREIT Venture and the MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $12.5 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis, including $4.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and $2.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness of MGM China. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. We do not guarantee MGM China\u2019s or the Operating Partnership\u2019s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to the extent MGM China or the Operating Partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility.\nIn addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.\nWe currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the $3.01 billion and $3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of the Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture, respectively. The terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation, which amount may be material, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand, we may need to raise capital, including incurring additional indebtedness, in order to satisfy our obligation. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us, or, if available, will be on terms that are satisfactory to us.\nMoreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. Our leases with MGP, the Bellagio BREIT Venture, and the MGP BREIT Venture have fixed rental payments (with annual escalators) and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties. Such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in Japan, strategic initiatives, including positioning BetMGM as a leader in online sports betting and iGaming, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, our senior credit facility calculates interest on outstanding balances using the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\") announced it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. Although our senior credit facility includes LIBOR replacement provisions that contemplate an alternate benchmark rate to be mutually agreed upon by us and the administrative agent, if necessary, any such changes may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made if LIBOR was available in its current form. As a result, there can be no assurance that discontinuation of LIBOR will not result in significant increases in benchmark interest rates, substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing, any of which could have an adverse effect on us.\nCurrent and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures. Our ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness and other significant financial commitments, including the rent payments under our leases, and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates (including CityCenter) and subsidiaries (including MGM China and the Operating Partnership), and borrow under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant deterioration to regional, national and international economic conditions, which has resulted in substantial declines in our revenues from our operations and expected distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries. We expect that the pandemic will continue to impact consumer spending levels in 2021 and potentially thereafter, and if we fail to generate cash sufficient to fund our liquidity\nneeds or satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt and lease instruments, we cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional debt on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nIn addition, we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2022, and thereafter. Our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis, we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements or leases.\nThe agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations. Covenants governing our senior credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nincur liens on assets;\n\u2022\nsell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nallow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions.\nOur ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In April of 2020 we entered into an amendment to our senior secured credit facility to waive the rent adjusted net leverage and interest coverage covenants through (but excluding) the second quarter of 2021 and adjust the required leverage and interest coverage levels for the covenant when it is reimposed at the end of the waiver period. In February 2021, we further amended the senior secured credit facility to extend the covenant relief period through (but excluding) the second quarter of 2022 and adjust the required leverage and interest coverage levels for the covenant when it is reimposed at the end of the waiver period. Any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial commitments.\nIn addition, each of MGM China and the Operating Partnership has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities, all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower\u2019s ability to engage in certain transactions, require them to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or sell assets.\nWe are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth initiatives, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes. As of December 31, 2020 we are required to make annual rent payments of $828 million under the master lease with MGP, annual rent payments of $250 million under the lease with Bellagio BREIT Venture, and annual rent payments of $292 million under the lease with MGP BREIT Venture, which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The leases also require us to spend a certain amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties. In addition, the leases governing the Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, and Mandalay Bay properties require us to comply with certain financial covenants which, if not met, will require us to deposit cash collateral or issue letters of credit for the benefit of the applicable landlord equal to one year of rent under the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay lease and two years of rent under the Bellagio lease. As a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure obligations, our ability to fund our operations, raise capital, make acquisitions, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the leases may:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, pay dividends, repurchase shares and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and\n\u2022\ncause us to lose our rights with respect to the applicable leased properties if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise default on the leases.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time. The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has been, and continues to be, complex and rapidly evolving, with governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms and other casino resort amenities, which has had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and which we expect to impact our consolidated results of operations during 2021 and potentially thereafter. In particular, although all of our properties are open to the public, they were all required to be fully closed for some periods of time during 2020 pursuant to various state and local government regulations, which had a negative impact on our results of operations during this period. In addition, in light of the recent significant increases in reported cases of COVID-19 across the country, as well as the emergence of variant strains, additional restrictions have been imposed in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including setting curfews and imposing restrictions on hotel and restaurant operations. In light of the continued impact of the pandemic on midweek visitation, the Company determined to temporarily close the hotel tower operations at Mandalay Bay and Park MGM midweek and determined to temporarily close The Mirage midweek, which are expected to resume full week operations on March 3, 2021. Further, our properties are continuing to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, and we are unable to predict the length of time it will take for our properties to return to normal operations or if our properties or portions of our properties will be required to close again due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of variant strains of the virus. See \u201c-Although all of our properties have re-opened to the public, they are operating without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, and we are unable to predict the length of time it will take for our properties to return to normal operations or if such properties will be required to close again due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nFollowing a temporary closure of MGM China\u2019s properties in Macau on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain health safeguards, such as limiting the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars, temperature checks, mask protection and the need to present negative COVID-19 test results and health declarations submitted through the Macau Health Code system which remain in effect. Effective July 15, 2020, all guests entering our casinos were required to provide a negative nucleic acid test result with a valid \u2018green\u2019 Macau Health Code. Although the issuance of tourist visas (including the IVS) for residents of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province and all other provinces in mainland China to travel to Macau resumed on August 12, 2020, August 26, 2020 and September 23, 2020, respectively, several travel and entry restrictions in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China remain in place (including the temporary suspension of ferry services from Hong Kong to Macau, the nucleic acid test result certificate and mandatory quarantine requirements for visitors from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and bans on entry or enhanced quarantine requirements on other visitors into Macau). As a result of the foregoing, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on MGM China\u2019s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and will likely continue to negatively impact MGM China\u2019s results of operations in 2021 given the uncertainty of the length of time of the pandemic, the emergence of variant strains of the virus and the continuation of operating restrictions and other limitations on visitation.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic (and whether there is a, or multiple, resurgences in the future); the availability of a vaccine and the efficacy of the vaccine against existing and new variants of the COVID-19 virus; the ability to effectively and efficiently distribute any vaccines domestically and internationally to allow travel to resume to pre-pandemic levels; the negative impact the pandemic has on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demand for travel, transient and group business, and levels of consumer confidence even after travel advisories and restrictions are lifted; the ability of us and our business partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; actions governments, businesses and individuals take\nin response to the pandemic (including the rise of variant strains of the virus), such as limiting or banning travel and limiting or banning leisure, casino and entertainment (including sporting events) activities; and how quickly economies, travel activity, and demand for gaming, entertainment and leisure activities recovers after the pandemic subsides. We may also face unforeseen liability or be subject to additional obligations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of claims alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connection with our operations or facilities or to the extent we are subject to a governmental enforcement action as a result of health and safety compliance. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in this section or in any other filings with the SEC. As a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration and impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, but it will continue to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and stock price.\nIn addition, while we expect to benefit from certain payroll tax and income tax relief provided under the CARES Act, we have not applied for any of the other available benefits, although we may do so in the future to the extent such benefits remain available or new benefits become available. If we were to apply for such benefits, we cannot predict the manner in which such benefits would be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you that we will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all. Certain of the benefits we may seek to access under the CARES Act have not previously been administered on the present scale or at all. Government or third party program administrators may be unable to cope with the volume of applications in the near term and any benefits we receive may not be as extensive as those for which we may apply, may impose additional conditions and restrictions on our operations or may otherwise provide less relief than we contemplate. If the U.S. government or any other governmental authority agrees to provide crisis relief assistance that we accept, it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid, including restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment of debt, limitations on debt and other similar restrictions that will apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full. We cannot assure you that any such government crisis relief assistance will not significantly limit our corporate activities or be on terms that are favorable to us. Such restrictions and terms could adversely impact our business and operations.\nAlthough all of our properties are open to the public, they are operating without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, and we are unable to predict the length of time it will take for our properties to return to normal operations or if such properties will be required to close again due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the date of this filing, all of our properties are open or expected to be open to the public, but are operating without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, including midweek hotel tower closures at Mandalay Bay and Park MGM and the full midweek closure of The Mirage, which are expected to resume full week operations on March 3, 2021. Accordingly, although our properties are open, they are generating revenues that are significantly lower than historical results. In addition, our properties may be subject to temporary, complete or partial shutdowns in the future due to COVID-19 related concerns. We have also implemented certain measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including limits on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and on the number of seats at each table game, as well as slot machine spacing, temperature checks, mask protection, limitations on restaurant capacity, entertainment events and conventions and other measures to enforce social distancing. While we engaged in aggressive cost reduction efforts to minimize cash outflows while our properties were closed, and have continued to engage in such efforts as our properties have re-opened, we still have significant fixed and variable expenses, which will adversely affect our profitability. In addition, we have seen, and continue to expect to see, weakened demand at our properties as a result of continued domestic and international travel restrictions or warnings, restrictions on amenity use, such as gaming, restaurant and pool capacity limitations, consumer fears and reduced consumer discretionary spending, general economic uncertainty and increased rates of unemployment. We also lease certain of our outlets to third parties that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic and there can be no assurance that these third parties will be able to pay rent or other obligations owed to us or continue to operate at our properties when we return to normalized operations. If we provide financial relief to existing tenants to assist them with continuing operations, fail to relet these properties, or if we are able to relet these properties on terms which are not as favorable to us as in our previous leases, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. In light of the foregoing, we are unable to determine when our properties will return to pre-pandemic demand or pricing, but the impact had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2020 and we expect that it will continue to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2021 and potentially thereafter.\nWe have undertaken aggressive actions to reduce costs and improve efficiencies to mitigate losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could negatively impact guest loyalty and our ability to attract and retain employees. As a result of the temporary closures of all of our domestic properties, the continued limitations on amenities offered at the properties and the continued uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of this pandemic, we have taken steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies, including substantial furloughs (which have resulted in a number of employees being separated from the Company) and headcount reductions. Such steps, and further changes we may make in the future to reduce costs, may negatively impact guest loyalty or our ability to attract and retain employees, and our reputation may suffer as a result. We may also face demands or requests from labor unions that represent our employees, whether in the course of our periodic renegotiation of our collective bargaining agreements, through effects bargaining relating to the shut down and/or reopening of our operations, or otherwise, for additional compensation, healthcare benefits or other terms as a result of COVID-19 that could increase costs, and we could experience labor disputes or disruptions as we continue to implement our COVID-19 mitigation plans.\nWe face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The hotel, resort, entertainment, and casino industries are highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming operations in other states or countries, as well as the increased availability of online sports betting and iGaming, could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. For instance, recently local referendums were passed to allow gaming in Virginia and Nebraska, with active lobbying occurring in additional states. While we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peer inventory sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners. We expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business.\nWe have also seen significant expansion across the United States in legalized forms of iGaming and online sports betting and expect additional jurisdictions will likely legalize iGaming and online sports betting in the future. We participate in the domestic iGaming and online sports betting market through our joint venture, BetMGM which faces significant competition from other industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment industries. If BetMGM is unable to sustain or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able to gain the scale necessary to successfully compete in the growing market and, as a result, we may not receive the anticipated benefits from our investment. In addition, the expansion of iGaming, online sports betting, and other types of gaming may further compete with our land-based operations by reducing customer visitation and spend at our properties.\nIn addition, competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the United States and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos. For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near Asia, certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) may legalize casino gaming (or iGaming) in the future. Furthermore, currently MGM Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau. If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities, we would face increased competition.\nMost jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses. Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise.\nIn addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate. Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces in which we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, our iGaming and online sports betting initiatives may be particularly subject to risks related to potential changes in the regulatory environment as a result of the continued development of regulations in this industry. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a \u201csporting event or contest\u201d fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (\u201cWire Act\u201d). The DOJ\u2019s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ\u2019s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated DOJ\u2019s new\nopinion. DOJ has appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. An adverse ruling in the Court of Appeals or other disposition of the case may impact our ability to engage in iGaming in the future. For a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see \u201cRegulation and Licensing\u201d and Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFurther, our directors, officers, key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities. If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Certain public and private issuances of securities, borrowings under credit agreements, guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities.\nMacau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China\u2019s interpretation, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, MGM China\u2019s activities in Macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies. We cannot assure you that MGM China will be able to obtain all necessary approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.\nIn addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. For instance, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Energy Policy Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Renewable Portfolio Standards, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and many others. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, smoking in casinos in Macau, including MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, is only permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or VIP areas. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonly known as the \u201cBank Secrecy Act\u201d, which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) any currency transactions in excess of $10,000 that occur within a 24-hour gaming day, including identification of the individual(s) involved in the currency transaction. We are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose. In addition, under the Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread. See \u201c-The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\u201d In addition to the pandemic-related restrictions that resulted in the temporary closures of our properties during 2020, governmental or other COVID-19-related restrictions may be extended, or new restrictions may be imposed in the future.\nOur business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside. Our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions, trade shows and business development. Economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. In addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable job market, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other acts of violence. Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the\npreferences of consumers and timely react to these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas may be affected by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United States, and California in particular. A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nFor example, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic as a result of its spread, and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of the outbreak, including the temporary suspension of gaming operations in Macau in February 2020, and the temporary closures of all of our domestic properties at times during 2020. As of the date hereof, while all of our properties are open to the public, they are operating without all amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, and accordingly, continue to generate revenues that are significantly lower than historical results. The full extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. See \u201c-The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\u201d\nIn addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai (and, to a lesser extent, our domestic properties) from mainland China, general economic, regulatory and market conditions in China could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China\u2019s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements, including continued market impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and market impacts resulting from China\u2019s recent anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and other ATM limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government), could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland China and/or the amounts they are willing to spend at our properties. Most recently, in July 2017, the Chinese government, along with Macau authorities, implemented new facial recognition technology on ATM machines in Macau to strictly enforce the \u201cknow your customer\u201d regulations for mainland Chinese bank cardholders and in November 2017 new rules were adopted to control the cross-border transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments. It is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.\nFurthermore, our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of the opening of new developments in Macau. While we seek employees from outside of Macau to adequately staff our resorts, certain Macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hire Macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase (including limitations on our ability to import labor as a result of temporary travel restrictions adopted as part of the COVID-19 mitigation efforts). Finally, because additional casino projects have commenced operations and other projects are under construction, the existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations at our developments in Macau, could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives, including those associated with our MGM 2020 Plan. As part of our MGM 2020 Plan, we undertook several initiatives to reduce costs and further position us for growth by the end of 2020. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented several additional cost savings initiatives in 2020 to improve our operating model. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all, that we will ultimately be able to realize the expected benefits of these or any other cost savings initiatives, or that any new additional costs or increases in existing expenses will not offset any cost savings. If we fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of any current or future cost savings initiatives, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business continues to evolve, we may need to adjust or expand our cost savings initiatives, which could have the effect of exacerbating the risks described above.\nThe anticipated benefits of our asset light strategy, including the Bellagio sale-leaseback transaction and MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Our current growth strategy is to pursue and execute on an asset-light business model, which involves a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to determine whether those assets can be monetized efficiently to allow unlocked capital to be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements, new growth opportunities and to return value to our shareholders. Our ability to execute on this strategy will depend on our ability to identify accretive transactions that optimize the value of our remaining assets. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to monetize our remaining real property assets on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any anticipated benefits from any such potential transactions will be realized.\nOur ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements. As part of our cost savings initiatives during the pandemic, we significantly reduced our historic dividend rate. Although we intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock; our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement, and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries ability to generate the cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock is be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, which has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to us is subject to any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us, and compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, future dividend payments may be further reduced or eliminated in their entirety. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nNearly all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Nearly all of our properties are subject to triple-net leases that, in addition to rent, require us to pay: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities. Furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation.\nIn addition, under the master lease with MGP, if some of our facilities should prove to be unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations, or if we should otherwise decide to exit a particular property, we would remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations even if we decided to cease operations at those locations unless we are able to transfer the rights with respect to a particular property in accordance with the requirements of the MGP master lease. Furthermore, our ability to transfer our obligations under the MGP master lease to a third-party with respect to individual properties, should we decide to withdraw from a particular location, is limited to non-Las Vegas properties and no more than two Las Vegas gaming properties, and is subject to identifying a willing third-party who meets the requirements for a transferee set forth in the MGP master lease, which we may be unable to find. In addition, we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including sublease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPaul Salem, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and Corey Sanders, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at MGP. Paul Salem serves as our Chairman and as the Chairman of MGP. In addition, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, is also a director of MGP, and Corey Sanders and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, are also directors of MGP. While we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to MGP contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) to any MGP shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law, these overlapping positions could nonetheless create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or MGP\u2019s management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as potential acquisition targets, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and MGP. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and MGP (or its subsidiaries) regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship, between us and MGP, such as under the master lease. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and MGP enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future.\nDespite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions involving consideration in excess of $25 million, must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives. We own the single outstanding Class B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from\noperations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP, and which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP\u2019s shares so long as the holder of the Class B share and its controlled affiliates\u2019 (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. We, therefore, have the ability to exercise significant control over MGP\u2019s affairs, including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to MGP\u2019s shareholders for approval. MGP\u2019s operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by MGP\u2019s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to MGP if it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of \u201cindependent\u201d directors (which MGP refers to as \u201cSpecial Approval\u201d) (such independence determined in accordance with the NYSE\u2019s listing standards, the standards established by the Exchange Act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by MGP\u2019s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to MGP or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP\u2019s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates). Furthermore, MGP\u2019s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value, individually or in the aggregate, over $25 million between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand (any such transaction (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries) under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of MGP\u2019s formation transactions), a \u201cThreshold Transaction\u201d), shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP\u2019s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates). As a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could have significant benefit to us may require Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. The failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.\nWe have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China. As a result of the extension of the Macau gaming subconcession, we entered into a First Renewed Deed of Non-Compete Undertakings with MGM China and Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (\u201cMs. Ho\u201d), pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China. While gaming is currently prohibited in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) the date MGM China\u2019s ordinary shares cease to be listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited or (ii) the date when our ownership of MGM China shares is less than 20% of the then-issued share capital of MGM China.\nThe Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental non-compliance by MGM Grand Paradise with applicable Macau laws or MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s basic obligations under the subconcession contract. MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the Macau government. Upon such termination, all of MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s casino area premises and gaming-related equipment would be transferred automatically to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.\nFurthermore, under the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau government might promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our Macau businesses. If any disagreement arises between MGM Grand Paradise and the Macau government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s compliance with, a provision of the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the Macau government. During any consultation or negotiation, MGM Grand Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macau government. Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the Macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. The loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in Macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the subconcession contract expires on June 26, 2022. Unless the subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, all of MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s casino premises and gaming-related equipment will automatically be transferred to the Macau government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract\nby providing us at least one year\u2019s prior notice. In the event the Macau government exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the convention and exhibition facilities, during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, depreciation and amortization, multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. We also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, the compensation paid to MGM Grand Paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.\nMGM Grand Paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in Macau. Gaming promoters, who promote gaming and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s gaming revenues in Macau. With the rise in gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operated by licensed gaming promoters, the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased. While MGM Grand Paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain, or grow, relationships with gaming promoters. In addition, continued reductions in, and new regulations governing, the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure of additional VIP rooms in Macau, including VIP rooms at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters, or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our high-end customers (or if, as a result of recent market conditions in Macau, gaming promoters encounter difficulties attracting patrons to come to Macau or experience decreased liquidity limiting their ability to grant credit to patrons), MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered. Furthermore, if existing VIP rooms at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai are closed there can be no assurance that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such VIP rooms in the future in a timely manner, or at all.\nIn addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses. While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom MGM Grand Paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon. If a gaming promoter falls below MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s standards, MGM Grand Paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations.\nWe also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans.\nThe future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods. We currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxes attributable to potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods, including the recapture of overall domestic losses to the extent of U.S. taxable income. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. This evaluation is based on all available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change.\nWe are subject to risks related to climate change. Extreme weather conditions, potentially exacerbated by climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business, which could harm our business and results of operations. Certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, tornados and winter storms in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations or the operations of critical suppliers, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations or the operations of critical suppliers could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate or source critical supplies could adversely affect our business. Although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may result in reduced availability or increased price volatility of certain critical supplies, may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties, and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period.\nBecause a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified. Given that a significant number of our major resorts are\nconcentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand, as a result of limitations on travel imposed to address the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.\nWe extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables. We conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. In addition, MGM Grand Paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nWhile gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nFurthermore, we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent MGM China gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM China may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM China may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. Moreover, under applicable law, MGM China remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers.\nEven where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits. We review our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be required in future periods. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nLeisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases. We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of our customers travel by air to our Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the outbreak of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, has severely disrupted, and is expected to continue to disrupt, domestic and international travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs. Although all of our properties are open to the public, we are still subject to capacity limitations on the size of gatherings in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which has had a significant impact on the willingness of our customers to come to our properties for conventions. Even when those restrictions are removed, consumer willingness to attend large scale conferences may be impacted for the foreseeable future due to continued concerns over safety and social distancing. See \u201c-The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\u201d\nFurthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.\nCo-investing in our properties, including our investments in CityCenter and BetMGM, decreases our ability to manage risk. In addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, in properties or businesses as a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. Therefore, the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition, investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject the properties or businesses owned by such entities to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors, or our co-investors could take actions binding on the property without our consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.\nFor instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support future funding requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us. In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter\u2019s indebtedness subject CityCenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, make distributions to us, make certain investments, consummate certain asset sales, enter into transactions with affiliates (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. The CityCenter credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require CityCenter to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in CityCenter\u2019s credit facility) for each quarter, which covenants are subject to a waiver through the maturity date of its revolving credit facility in April 2022. We cannot be sure that CityCenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test.\nIn addition, we share control of BetMGM with Entain with all major operating, investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both members. Disagreements between us and Entain could arise in the future, including with respect to the amount and timing of capital contributions. If we and Entain are unable to support the future funding of BetMGM, then BetMGM may not have the resources to execute on the development or implementation of its strategies, including funding efforts to increase its market share, which could result in us not receiving the anticipated benefits from our investment.\nAny of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects.\nAny of our future construction, development or expansion projects, such as our proposed integrated resort in Japan, will be subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;\n\u2022\nchanges to plans and specifications;\n\u2022\nengineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;\n\u2022\nshortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, residential, real estate development or construction projects;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or work stoppages;\n\u2022\navailability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\ndisputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\npersonal injuries to workers and other persons;\n\u2022\nenvironmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;\n\u2022\nweather interferences or delays;\n\u2022\nfires, typhoons and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ngeological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.\nThe occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake. In addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties, including revenue lost while rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future. Although we have \u201call risk\u201d property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism or other acts of violence), each policy has certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.\nIn addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event. Furthermore, the leases we entered into in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction and the Bellagio sale-leaseback transaction require us to maintain specified insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of insurance coverage required by these leases and, to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all, then we would need to obtain amendments to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease, which could have material adverse effect on our business.\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nAny failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business. The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks. We file applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs. In particular, the risks associated with the operation of MGM China or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in non-United States government programs;\n\u2022\npossible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent labor regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in environmental, health and safety laws;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of diseases or epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;\n\u2022\neconomic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the United States dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us. Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Please see the further discussion in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nA significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 24,000 (excluding approximately 10,000 furloughed employees) of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations, and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To the extent that our non-union employees seek union representation or elect union representation, we would have exposure to risks associated with representation proceedings, labor negotiations and/or economic impacts of newly negotiated labor agreements. Furthermore, we may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered,\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. For instance, Borgata\u2019s most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of the UNITE HERE Retirement Fund, which has been listed in \u201ccritical status\u201d and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in\nan amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such additional costs may be significant.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results. We are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.\nThe failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data. We collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, and others for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by the various states, the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent (or conflict) between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, the European Union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the General Data Protection Regulation, which became fully enforceable in May 2018, that includes operational and compliance requirements with significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, California has enacted a new privacy law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the United States.\nCompliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including, but not limited to, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks by third parties. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient.\nWe also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations. For instance, there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and data, including those we maintain with our third-party service providers, have been subject to cyber security breaches in the past and may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties\u2019 information security operations. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation. Many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance factors and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas including diversity and inclusion, community engagement and philanthropy, environmental sustainability, climate change, responsible gaming, supply chain management, workplace conduct, human rights and many others, some of which may be unforeseen. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses, properties or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties, including MGP. Acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:\n\u2022\nspending cash and incurring debt;\n\u2022\nassuming contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022\nretaining key employees; and\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, even if we are able to identify any such opportunities and complete transactions, we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of our acquisitions or that they will be accretive to our results of operations. Our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitions could materially change, including as a result of factors beyond our control, and could delay, decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions. In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs, competitive responses, loss or customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention, and the expansion of our operations in general, whether through acquisition, development or internal growth, could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting fees.\nIn addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected. State and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees, including taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase taxes, including gaming taxes or fees, depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nConflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, the holding company for MGM Grand Paradise which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. As a result of the initial public offering of shares of MGM China common stock in 2011, MGM China has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of MGM China may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of MGM China. Decisions that could have different implications for us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM China, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.", "PERMNO": 11891, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "MGM"}
