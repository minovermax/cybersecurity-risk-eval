{"cik": "721447", "company": "CCA INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nConcentration of Risk.\nThe Company relies on mass merchandisers and major food and drug chains for the sales of its products. The loss of any one of those accounts or substantial reduction of sales revenues realized from their business could have a material negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations. All of the Company\u2019s products have independent and substantial competition and must be able to effectively compete in order to maintain the Company's position on the retail merchandisers\u2019 shelves. (See Business-General, Item 1 (c) Marketing.)\nWe are Dependent on Independent Contract Manufacturers.\nThe Company does not manufacture any of its products. All of the products are manufactured for the Company by independent contract manufacturers. There can be no assurance that these independent contract manufacturers will manufacture our products in the time, in accordance with our specifications or at the level of quality expected. There can be no assurance that the failure of a supplier to deliver the products ordered by the Company, when requested, will not cause burdensome delays in the Company\u2019s shipments to its customers. The Company does constantly seek alternative suppliers should a major supplier fail to deliver as contracted. A failure of the Company to ship as ordered by its customers could cause penalties and/or cancellations of our customers\u2019 orders. In addition, an unanticipated need to transition to a new supplier could result in delays that could impact timely distribution of our products. Any of the foregoing events, depending upon the timing and particular circumstances, could have a material adverse impact on our relationships with our customers and our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nThere is No Assurance That The Business Will Be Able to Operate Profitably.\nIn fiscal 2015, net sales were $24,753,950 with a net loss from continuing operations of $3,256,632 and a net gain from discontinued operations of $12,421, for a total net loss of $3,244,211. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s products will be successful or that its future operations will be profitable.\nWe may experience periods of declines in sales, especially during periods of economic downturn, and any material reduction in our sales could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nAdditional risk factors for consideration:\nWe continue to execute our turnaround strategy and there is no assurance that our sales trends and operating results may not take longer to recover than planned, which would impact our future operating results and cash flows.\nOur operating plan contemplates improvement in our operating results for 2016 and beyond. We are in a turnaround, our initiatives designed to improve our sales and operating results are still in the early stages which adds challenges and uncertainty, and we incurred a significant operating loss in fiscal 2014 and 2015. There can be no assurance that our past sales trends and operating results may not continue longer than we expect or may take longer to recover than we have planned or that we will achieve our operating plan, which would negatively impact revenues, operating results and cash flows. There is no assurance that our cash from operations and credit from external sources will at all times be sufficient for all of our operating requirements and other cash requirements. If this were to occur, we would closely monitor our operating performance and our liquidity and take actions designed to improve our liquidity and mitigate any shortfall and potentially seek other or additional financing and seek to take other actions, although there can be no assurance that any of these actions would be successful or that any such additional liquidity, if needed, would be available or obtainable on sufficient or favorable terms, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results, liquidity, financial position and business.\nWe depend on our existing credit facility, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory.\nOn December 4, 2015 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), CCA Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), entered into the Credit and Security Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with SCM Specialty Finance Opportunities Funds, L.P., an affiliate of CNH Finance, L.P (together \"SCM\"). The Credit Agreement provides for a line of credit up to a maximum of $5,500,000 (the \u201cRevolving Loan\u201d). The Revolving Loan and all other amounts due and owing under the Credit Agreement and related documents are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in, and lien on, substantially all of the assets of the Company. Amounts available for borrowing under the Line of Credit equal the lesser of the Borrowing Base (as defined below), and $5,500,000, in each case, as the same is reduced by the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Line of Credit. \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d under the Loan Agreement means, generally, the amount equal to (i) 85% of the Company\u2019s eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) 65% of the value of eligible inventory, less (iii) certain reserves. If the Company does not have sufficient eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement may be reduced. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants on the part of the Company, including a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement imposes an early termination fee and also provides for events of default, including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, SCM may elect to declare the entire unpaid principal balance of the term loan and line of credit to be immediately due and payable, together with interest and all costs incurred by SCM under the loan agreement. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and development efforts will depend on our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our outsourcing and restructuring plan and our ability to generate cash in the future from our operations which cannot be assured. These items, to a certain extent, are dependent upon industry conditions, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe Company is Dependent on Outsourced Core Function Vendors\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2014, management approved and began implementing the Company's outsourcing agreements with the Emerson Group, which includes sales, customer service, accounts receivable collection functions, warehousing and shipping functions. While there are other vendors that provide these services, which could be sought as alternative vendors, any disruption in our sales, shipments, collections or any other core outsourced function, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and business.\nThe Fast Moving Consumer Goods Segment is Highly Competitive.\nThe market for cosmetics and perfumes, and health-and-beauty aids products in general, including patent medicines, is characterized by vigorous competition among producers, many of whom have substantially greater financial, technological and marketing resources than the Company. Major competitors such as Revlon, L\u2019Oreal, Colgate-Palmolive, Coty, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble have the broadest-based public recognition of their products and are significantly larger than the Company. Moreover, a substantial number of other health-and-beauty aids manufacturers and distributors may also have greater resources than the Company and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on research and development, advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. Our inability to successfully compete with our competitors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operation and business.\nOur Class A Shareholders Retain Control of Board of Directors.\nClass A Shareholder, Capital Preservation Holdings, LLC has the right to elect four members to the Board of Directors. Capital Preservation Holdings, LLC is controlled by Lance Funston, the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and as a result, able to exert significant influence over our business. The holders of Common Stock have the right to elect three members to the Board of Directors.\nFuture Success Depends on Continued Success of the Company\u2019s Current Products and New Product Development.\nThe Company is not financially as strong as the major companies against whom it competes. The ability to successfully introduce new niche products and increase the growth and profitability of its current and new niche brand products will affect the business and prospects of the future of the Company and this ability is dependent upon the creativity and marketing skills of management and its advisors and business partners.\nAll of the Company\u2019s product must be in compliance with all FDA and state regulations and all products which are being manufactured for the Company by outside suppliers must conform to the FDA\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practices requirements. It is the Company\u2019s responsibility to ascertain that the suppliers conform with these requirements. Damage could be caused to our reputation and our relationships with our customers and consumers if our products do not comply with such legal requirements, or with consumer expectations, which could result in diminished sales or liability claims, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nThe Company Relies On A Few Large Customers For A Significant Portion Of Its Sales.\nIn fiscal 2015, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. represented 34.6% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company\u2019s five largest customers accounted for 65.5% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company has no agreements with any of its customers to stock its products. The Company\u2019s business would suffer materially if it lost Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as a customer. The loss of any significant reduction in sales to any of the Company\u2019s five top customers could likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Price of the Company\u2019s Stock May Be Volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock could fluctuate substantially. There is a limited float of shares tradable. There are factors beyond the Company\u2019s control which may cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate significantly, including but not limited to the volatility of small cap stocks in general, general stock market conditions, and general economic variations. In addition, variations in the Company\u2019s operating revenues and profits and the timing of advertising commitments also may have an effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nClimate Change Effects.\nThe Company continues to monitor climate changes for any potential impact on its business. At this time, the Company does not anticipate that any climate change or climate change regulations will have a material impact on its operations or business.\nThe Company May Experience Interruptions to Its Business Operations Due to Events Beyond Its Control\nA catastrophic event beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as a natural disaster, health pandemic, cyber attack, adverse weather event or act of terrorism, that results in the destruction or disruption of any of the Company\u2019s critical business systems or operations could harm its ability to conduct normal business operations and its operating results.\nWe Depend on Key Personnel.\nOur employees are key to the growth and success of our business. This depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including our executive officers and key management personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe Future Growth of the Company Depends on an Effective Marketing Program.\nAn effective marketing program includes media advertising, in-store merchandising and enhancing distribution, co-operative advertising with our retail partners and product promotions that increase product availability, awareness, and help generate increased sales for our customers. Our inability to develop and implement effective advertising campaign, marketing or promotional programs, that will succeed in a difficult economic environment and highly competitive marketplace, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Sell to International Accounts.\nIn fiscal 2015, international sales accounted for approximately 13.2% of our total net sales with shipments to our Canadian distributor accounting for approximately 1.6% of our total net sales. Our international sales expose the Company to additional risks associated with political or regulatory conditions, the dependence on other economies and foreign currency fluctuations which may diminish demand for U.S. goods and subject us to adverse translation impact. A terrorist attack, the threat of a terrorist attack or foreign military operations or other catastrophic event beyond the Company's control could prevent us from shipping to our international accounts. A loss of or material reduction in our international sales would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Purchase Some Raw Materials or Components from International Suppliers.\nSome of the components used in our products are sourced from international suppliers either by the Company directly or through our outside contract manufacturers. This exposes the Company to an additional risk of increased costs if the foreign currency exchange rates change unfavorably. A terrorist attack, the threat of a terrorist attack or foreign military operations or other catastrophic event beyond the Company's control could prevent the international suppliers from delivering their goods to the Company or contract manufacturers. The interruption of the supply could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Have Entered into Employment and Change of Control Agreements that would Require Us to Make Substantial Payments in connection with a Change of Control of the Company.\nThe Company has entered into Employment Agreements with Stephen A. Heit, the Company's Chief Financial Officer (\"the Executive\") and one other employee. The Employment Agreements may, in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances or a change of control of the Company, result in a lump sum payment equal to three times the Executive\u2019s base annual salary and prior year bonus plus other benefits. As a result, if the Company was required to make a substantial payment to the Executives under these agreements, there would be a significant impact on the Company\u2019s cash reserves and earnings. For further information, see Part III, Section 11, Executive Compensation.\nThe Company May Not be Able to Fully Realize its Deferred Tax Assets.\nThe amounts recognized in the deferred tax asset are management's best estimate of the amount more likely than not to be realized and the actual results could differ from those estimates. In determining the amount more likely than not to be realized, management considered available information and determined the negative objective evidence, primarily recent losses offset by positive objective evidence, including the effects of current year restructuring expenses that will not recur, the savings of the related payroll and rent expense resulting from the restructuring and forecasts for future profitability. Future profitability in this competitive industry depends on the successful execution of management's initiatives designed to obtain sales levels and improve operating results. The inability to successfully execute these initiatives could reduce estimates of future profitability, which could affect the Company's ability to realize the deferred tax assets.", "PERMNO": 21785, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "CAWW"}
