{"cik": "1316644", "company": "AeroGrow International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, future performance and forward-looking statements are affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions in the United States, Canada and worldwide, competition, interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other events. The following items are representative of the risks, uncertainties and other conditions that may impact our business.\nRisks Related to our Business, Products and Markets\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since inception and may never achieve profitability.\nSince we commenced operations in 2002, and through March 31, 2015, we incurred substantial losses, including a net loss of $191,000 for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2015. As of March 31, 2015, our losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $82.4 million. The future success of our business will depend on our ability to use the Scotts Miracle-Gro partnership to: (i) profitably expand sales of our AeroGarden indoor garden systems, seed pod kits and accessory products; (ii) develop new product extensions and applications; and (iii) efficiently spend marketing dollars to gain customer acceptance.\nOur financial condition may limit our ability to borrow funds or to raise additional equity as may be required to fund our future operations.\nOur ability to borrow funds or raise additional equity may be limited by our financial condition. In addition, a failure to obtain additional funding to support our working capital and operating requirements could prevent us from making expenditures that are needed to allow us to grow our operations. In the event we cannot raise additional funding to fulfill working capital needs, we will have to scale back on our operating plans for the current and future fiscal years. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the additional capital in an amount and in time to support all of our operating plans.\nAs we grow our sales into the retail channel and increase sales through individual retailers, the loss or significant reductions in orders from our top retail customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn Fiscal 2015, our net sales to two retail customers, Amazon.com, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, totaled 75.5% of our total net sales to retailers and 47.1% of our total net sales. The loss of these significant customers, or a significant decline in orders could materially affect our sales of indoor garden systems, seed pod kits and accessories, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe do not have long-term sales agreements with, or other contractual assurances as to future sales to, any of our current or planned major retail customers. In addition, our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailers, such as payment terms, shelf space limitations, price demands and other conditions.\nOur future success is completely dependent on our ability to market our indoor garden systems, seed pod kits and accessory products and generate consumer acceptance on a broader scale.\nWe have introduced our indoor garden systems and seed pod kits as new products to consumer markets unfamiliar with their use and benefits. Although we believe that we have penetrated only a small portion of the potential market for our products, our marketing efforts may not generate widespread consumer adoption. If our marketing strategies fail to attract customers, our product sales may not produce future revenue sufficient to meet our operating expenses or fund our future operations. Our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to recruit, train and retain key personnel necessary to operate our business, our ability to successfully manage our business and develop and market our products may be harmed.\nTo maintain our business position, we will need to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled design, development, management, accounting, sales, merchandising, marketing, and customer service personnel. Competition for many of these types of personnel can be intense, depending on general economic conditions, alternative employment options, and job location. As a result, we may be unable to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel. Additionally, any of our officers or employees can terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of any key employee, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA worsening of the economy, particularly in the United States and Canada, could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business operations depends significantly on consumer confidence and discretionary spending, which deteriorated during the recent worldwide economic downturn. A re-occurrence of the economic downturn and the consequent impact on consumer spending, particularly in the United States and Canada, could adversely impact our revenue, ability to market our products, build customer loyalty, or otherwise implement our business strategy. In such a scenario, we would experience a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur revenue and level of business activity are highly seasonal, requiring us to staff our operations, incur overhead and marketing costs, purchase and manufacture inventory, and incur other operating costs in advance of having firm customer orders for our products. A material variance in actual orders relative to anticipated orders could have an adverse impact on our business.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, approximately 70.5% of our total net sales occurred during four consecutive calendar months (October through January). We must therefore estimate sales in advance of the anticipated peak months and operate our business during the balance of the year in such a way as to insure that we can meet the demand for our products during the peak months. This requires us to incur significant operating, marketing, and overhead expenses, and to utilize cash and other capital resources to invest in inventory in advance of having certainty as to the ultimate level of demand for our product during the peak months. Shortfalls in the supply of our products could result in a significant loss of revenue due to lack of adequate product inventory. For example, the cobranding of our product with the \u201cMiracle-Gro AeroGarden\u201d trade name caused a delay in available inventory during the first six months of Fiscal 2014. Additionally, during the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2013, a labor strike in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach delayed the delivery of AeroGarden inventory during the critical pre-Christmas season and caused a decline in sales during that time period. Alternatively, a shortfall in actual demand for our products, relative to forecast, during peak months could cause us to liquidate excess inventory at a loss or at substantially lower margins. In any of these cases, we may not generate enough revenue to cover expenses incurred throughout the balance of the year. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur current or future manufacturers could fail to fulfill our orders for indoor garden systems, which would disrupt our business, increase our costs, and could potentially cause us to lose our market.\nWe currently depend on four contract manufacturers in China to produce our indoor garden systems. These manufacturers could fail to produce the indoor garden system to our specifications or in a workmanlike manner and may not deliver the systems on a timely basis. Our manufacturers must also obtain inventories of the necessary parts and tools for production. Although we own the tools and dies used by our manufacturers, our manufacturers operate in China. As a result, our manufacturers may be subject to business risks that fall outside our control, including but not limited to, political, currency, regulatory and shipping/transportation risks, each of which may affect the manufacturer\u2019s ability to fulfill our orders for indoor garden systems. As discussed in the preceding risk factor, the December 2012 labor strike in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach (delayed the delivery of AeroGarden inventory during the critical pre-Christmas season and caused a decline in sales during the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2013. In addition, port congestion in October 2014 backed up deliveries and delayed ground transportation during the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. Weather or natural disasters in China could disrupt our supply of product. Any change in manufacturers could disrupt or delay our ability to fulfill orders for indoor garden systems while we search for alternative supply sources, provide specifications, and test initial production. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur current AeroGarden manufacturers are located in China and therefore our product costs may be subject to fluctuations in the value of the dollar against the Chinese currency and increases in Chinese labor rates.\nAlthough we purchase our AeroGarden products in U.S. dollars, the prices charged by our factories are predicated upon their cost for components, labor and overhead. Therefore, increases in Chinese labor rates and changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Chinese currency may cause our manufacturers to raise prices of our products, which could reduce our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly reliant upon a single distribution and assembly facility. Any material disruption to the operation of this facility could adversely affect our business.\nAll of our North American fulfillment and distribution operations, and the entirety of our seed pod kit assembly operations are located in a third-party-managed facility based in Mexico, Missouri. Any material disruption to the operation of this facility, whether caused by internal or external factors could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party providers in our manufacturing, warehouse, distribution, order processing, and fulfillment operations. If these parties are unwilling to continue providing services to us, or are unable to adequately perform such services for us on a cost effective basis, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe engage third parties to perform certain critical functions supporting our business operations. Any disruption in our relationship with any of our vendors could cause significant disruption to our business and we may not be able to locate another party that can provide comparable services in a manner that is timely, consistent with our business plan, or on acceptable commercial terms. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may face significant competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our sales may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our complete indoor garden systems offer significant benefits over traditional hydroponic industry products. However, there are companies in a variety of related markets, including but not limited to, consumer electronics, commercial hydroponics, gardening wholesale, and soil-based gardening that are larger, better funded, and have experience in our channels of distribution. These companies may decide to develop products to compete with our products. These companies could use hydroponic technologies, and could achieve better consumer acceptance. The success of any competing products may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in energy prices, resulting from general economic conditions, or other factors, may raise our cost of goods sold and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEnergy costs, especially gasoline and fuel costs, are significant expenses in the delivery of our products. Increased costs resulting from general economic conditions, war, acts of nature, or other factors, may result in declining margins and operating results if market conditions prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases on our products. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our indoor garden systems fail to perform properly, our business could incur increased warranty-related costs and reduced income.\nFrom our inception through March 31, 2015, we have sold approximately 1.3 million AeroGardens and have provided a limited warranty with each garden sold. In addition, our indoor garden systems are \u201cguaranteed to grow.\u201d We therefore may be required to replace or repair products or refund the purchase price to consumers. Failure of our products to meet expectations could damage our reputation, decrease sales, increase costs related to returns and repairs, delay market acceptance of our products, result in unpaid accounts receivable, and divert our resources to remedy the malfunctions. The occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to litigation that, if decided adversely to us, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters, in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to such litigation. Although we do not believe that any current litigation poses a material threat to our business, defense of any lawsuits or proceedings, even if successful, may require management to spend a substantial time and attention on the part of our management personnel that otherwise would be spent on other aspects of our business, and may require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of lawsuits also may result in significant payments and modifications to our operations. In addition, we also may be subject to adverse publicity as a result of litigation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Market for our Securities\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate greatly. Investors in AeroGrow common stock bear the risk that they will not recover their investment.\nOur common stock, like that of many emerging growth companies, is typically subject to price and volume volatility. Trading in our common stock is limited, and the price per share is likely to be influenced by the price at which and the amount of shares that selling security holders are attempting to sell at any time. A number of large stockholders, including Scotts Miracle-Gro and its affiliates, have held their investment in our common stock for a substantial period of time and may desire to sell their shares, which could drive down the price of our common stock. Our common stock may also be subject to the activities of persons engaged in short selling securities, which generally has the effect of driving the price down. The price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely. A full and stable trading market for our common stock may never develop and, as a result, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at the time they elect, if at all.\nWe can issue debt securities and shares of preferred stock without approval of common stockholders, which could adversely affect your rights and undermine the value of your shares.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allow our Board of Directors to approve the terms and conditions of debt securities and preferred stock for issuance by the Company, including but not limited to voting rights, conversion privileges and liquidation preferences, without the approval of common stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be adversely impacted as a result of the rights that could potentially be granted to holders of debt securities or preferred stock that we may issue. As a result, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by future issuances of debt or preferred stock.\nFor example, in April 2013 (during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014), we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with SMG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Scotts Miracle-Gro. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, SMG acquired 2,649,007 shares of the Company\u2019s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d), and (ii) a warrant to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cWarrant\u201d). The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into 2,649,007 shares of common stock ($4.0 million divided by a conversion price of $1.51 per share). The Warrant entitles, but does not obligate, Scotts Miracle-Gro to purchase a number of shares of common stock that, on a \u201cfully diluted basis,\u201d constitute 80% of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock (when added to all other shares owned), as calculated as of the date or dates of exercise. The Warrant can be exercised at any time and from time to time for a period of five years between April 22, 2016 and April 22, 2021.\nUnder the Securities Purchase Agreement, our Board of Directors is required to consist of five members. While the Warrant is outstanding, SMG is entitled to elect one director and have one additional Board observer. As a result of this transaction, your rights as a common stockholder could be adversely affected. Because the holder of Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an \u201cas-converted\u201d basis with the common stock, SMG controls approximately 31% of the voting power of our outstanding equity. If SMG exercises the Warrant, its voting power will increase. Please see Note 3 \u201cScotts Miracle-Gro Transactions - Convertible Preferred Stock, Warrants and Other Transactions\u201d to our financial statements for more detailed disclosure regarding the strategic relationship with Scotts Miracle-Gro and the terms of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the Warrant and other transactions. In addition, we entered into a $4.5 million Term Loan Agreement with Scotts Miracle-Gro in July 2014. Interest was charged at the stated rate of 10% per annum, and was paid in April 2015 in the form of 136,895 shares of AeroGrow common stock, valued at a price per share equal to the conversion price of the Series B Preferred Conversion Price on the date the Term Loan.\nAs a result, SMG may be deemed to have effective control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including the election of our entire Board. It is unlikely that a change of control of our company could be effected without SMG\u2019s approval.\nOur outstanding warrants, options and any additional future obligations to issue our securities to various parties may dilute the value of an investment in AeroGrow. In addition, the terms and conditions of these securities could significantly impact the price of our common shares, and could adversely impact our ability to raise additional equity capital.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had reserved for issuance up to approximately 3.6 million additional shares of common stock under the terms of warrants, options, convertible preferred stock, and other arrangements, including the conversion of Series B Convertible Preferred and exercise of Warrants issued to Scotts Mircale-Gro.\nFor the length of time the warrants, options and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders will have an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming all the risks of common share ownership. This may adversely affect the terms upon which we can obtain additional capital and may be dilutive to the interests of common stockholders. In this regard, interest on the Term Loan with Scotts Miracle-Gro was charged at the stated rate of 10% per annum, and was paid in April 2015 in the form of 136,895 shares of AeroGrow common stock, valued at a price per share equal to the conversion price of the Series B Preferred Conversion Price on the date the Term Loan. The holders of such derivative securities would likely exercise or convert them at a time when we would be able to obtain equity capital on terms more favorable than the exercise or conversion prices provided by the notes, warrants or options.\nFurther, issuances of equity and/or debt securities, or the perception that such issuances may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impair our ability to raise capital in the future.", "PERMNO": 92086, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "AERO"}
