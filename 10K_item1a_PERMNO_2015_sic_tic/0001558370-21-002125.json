Risk Factors.\nSignificant factors that could impact the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations include, without limitation, the following:\nRisk factors which we believe affect all competitors in our industry\n\u25cf Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by changes in confectionary trade practices and consumer patterns, operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease or pandemic outbreak, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, and other public health concerns, consumer spending levels, shopping habits and behaviors (including changes in impulse purchase behaviors), consumer activities, work routines, events and traditions where confectionary products are consumed, the availability of our products at retail, including at large retail customers, and our ability to manufacture and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner. Government mandates to \u201cshelter in place\u201d or \u201cclosing of the economy\u201d, public health guidelines, or fear of exposure or actual effects of a disease, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, have in 2020 and in the future could continue to negatively impact our overall business and financial results. Specific factors that may impact our operations, some of which have had, and in the future could have, an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of Covid-19, include, but are not limited to:\na. Significant reductions in demand for one or more of our products - Changes in demand may be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, travel restrictions, financial hardship, \u201cshelter in place\u201d directives, or overall fear to return to past behaviors.\nShifts in demand for one or more of our products, changes in trade and distribution patterns, or changes in consumer buying habits, if prolonged, could negatively impact our results.\nb. The inability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and achieve efficient production of finished products - Disruptions in our manufacturing operations or supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing materials, supplies and services, transportation resources, workforce availability, or other manufacturing and distribution capability could have significant adverse effects on our business and financial results.\nc. Significant adverse changes in the political conditions and government mandates or directives - In markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions such as quarantine or travel restrictions, that limit or close our manufacturing, distribution or office facilities, or otherwise prevent our third-party suppliers, sales brokers, or customers from achieving the level of operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, could negatively impact our results.\nd. Risk related to Halloween and other seasonal sales - The Company\u2019s net product sales are highest during the Halloween season which have historically comprised approximately 50% of third quarter domestic net product sales. Changes in consumer behavior, traditions, behaviors, and interest in Halloween activities and events, or changes mandated or recommended by government or health officials, as well as negative media coverage, could significantly affect the Company\u2019s seasonal sales.\ne. Risks relating to potential employer liability - The effects of Covid-19 relating to employer liability remains uncertain, and if it is determined that employers are to have liability for employee or other matters related to Covid-19, this could have significant adverse effects on our financial results.\n\u25cf Risk of changes in the price and availability of raw materials - The principal ingredients used by the Company are subject to price volatility. Although the Company engages in commodity hedging transactions and annual supply agreements as well as leveraging the high volume of its annual purchases, the Company may experience price increases in certain ingredients that it may not be able to offset, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, although the Company has historically been able to procure sufficient supplies of its ingredients, market conditions could change such that adequate supplies might not be available or only become available at substantially higher costs. Adverse weather patterns, including the effects of climate change or supply interruptions, could also significantly affect the cost and availability of ingredients.\n\u25cf Risk of changes in product performance and competition - The Company competes with other well-established manufacturers of confectionery products. A failure of new or existing products to be favorably received, a failure to retain preferred shelf space at retail or a failure to sufficiently counter aggressive promotional and price competition could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf Risk of discounting and other competitive actions - Discounting and pricing pressure by the Company\u2019s retail customers, including the effects of import tariffs, and other competitive actions could make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its operating margins. Actions taken by major customers and competitors may make shelf space less available for the confectionery product category or some of the Company\u2019s products.\n\u25cf Risk of pricing actions - Inherent risks in the marketplace, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of pricing actions, including related trade discounts, or product weight changes (indirect price increases), could make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its sales and operating margins.\n\u25cf Risk related to seasonality of sales - The Company\u2019s sales are highest during the Halloween season. Circumstances surrounding Halloween, such as, widespread adverse weather or other widespread events that affect consumer behavior and related media coverage at that time of year or general changes in consumer interest in Halloween, could significantly affect the Company\u2019s sales.\n\u25cf Risk of changes in consumer preferences and tastes - Failure to adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, consumer health concerns and product preferences, including product ingredients, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf Risk of economic conditions on consumer purchases - The Company\u2019s sales are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, disposable income, availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Volatility in food and energy costs, rising unemployment and/or underemployment, declines in personal spending, recessionary economic conditions or other adverse market conditions, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenues, profitability and financial condition.\n\u25cf Risks related to environmental matters - The Company\u2019s operations are not particularly impactful on the environment, but, increased government environmental regulation or legislation, including various \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\n\u25cf Risk of new governmental laws and regulations - Governmental laws and regulations, including those that affect food advertising and marketing to children, use of certain ingredients in products, new labeling requirements, income and other taxes and tariffs, including the effects of changes to international trade agreements, new taxes targeted toward confectionery products and the environment, both in and outside the U.S.A., are subject to change over time, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and ability to compete in domestic or foreign marketplaces.\n\u25cf Risk of labor stoppages - To the extent the Company experiences any significant labor stoppages, strikes or possible labor shortages, could negatively affect overall operations including production or shipments of finished product to customers. The Company\u2019s union labor agreement at its Chicago plant was executed in 2018 and will continue through September 2022.\n\u25cf Risk of the cost of energy increasing - Higher energy costs would likely result in higher plant overhead, distribution, freight and delivery, and other operating costs. The Company may not be able to offset these cost increases or pass such cost increases onto customers in the form of price increases, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf Risk of a product recall - Issues related to the quality and safety of the Company\u2019s products could result in a voluntary or involuntary large-scale product recall. Costs associated with a product recall and related litigation or fines, and marketing costs relating to the re-launch of such products or brands, could negatively affect operating results. In addition, negative publicity associated with this type of event, including a product recall relating to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could negatively impact future demand for the Company\u2019s products.\n\u25cf Risk of operational interruptions relating to computer software or hardware failures, including cyber-attacks - The Company is reliant on computer systems to operate its business and supply chain. Software failure or corruption, including cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or catastrophic hardware failures or other disasters could disrupt communications, supply chain planning and activities relating to sales demand forecasts, materials procurement, production and inventory planning, customer shipments, and financial and accounting, all of which could negatively impact sales and profits.\n\u25cf Risk of releasing sensitive information - Although the Company does not believe that it maintains a large amount of sensitive data, a system breach, whether inadvertent or perpetrated by hackers, could result in identity theft, ransomware and/or a disruption in operations which could expose the Company to financial costs and adversely affect profitability.\n\u25cf Disruption to the Company\u2019s supply chain could impair the Company\u2019s ability to produce or deliver its finished products, resulting in a negative impact on operating results - Disruption to the manufacturing operations or supply chain, some of which are discussed above, could result from, but are not limited to adverse tariffs which could effectively limit supply or make supply more costly, natural disasters, pandemics, weather, fire or explosion, earthquakes, terrorism or other acts of violence, unavailability of ingredients or packaging materials, labor strikes or other labor activities, operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers. Although precautions are taken to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions, if the Company is unable, or if it is not financially feasible to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nRisk factors which we believe are principally specific to our Company (although some may apply to varying degrees to competitors in our industry)\n\u25cf Risks relating to participation in the multi-employer pension plan for certain Company union employees - As outlined in the Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and discussed in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, the Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan (Plan) which is currently in \u201ccritical and declining status\u201d, as defined by applicable law. A designation of \u201ccritical and declining status\u201d implies that the Plan is expected to become insolvent within the next 20 years. Under terms of a rehabilitation plan, the Company is to be assessed 5% annual compounded surcharges on its contributions to the Plan until such time as the Plan emerges from critical status. Should the Company withdraw from the Plan, it would be subject to a significant withdrawal liability which is discussed in Note 7 of the Company\u2019s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis. The Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter and therefore, is unable to determine the effects on its consolidated financial statements, but, the ultimate outcome could be material to its consolidated results of operations in one or more future periods.\n\u25cf Risk of impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets - In accordance with authoritative guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to an impairment evaluation annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Other long-lived assets are likewise tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Such evaluations are based on assumptions and variables including sales growth, profit margins and discount rates. Adverse changes in any of these variables could affect the carrying value of these intangible assets and the Company\u2019s reported profitability.\n\u25cf Risk of production interruptions - The majority of the Company\u2019s products are manufactured in a single production facility on specialized equipment. In the event of a disaster, such as a fire or earthquake, at a specific plant location, it would be difficult to transfer production to other facilities or a new location in a timely manner, which could result in loss of market share for the affected products. In addition, from time to time, the Company upgrades or replaces this specialized equipment. In many cases these are integrated and complex installations. A failure or delay in implementing such an installation could impact the availability of one or more of the Company\u2019s products which would have an adverse impact on sales and profits.\n\u25cf Risk related to investments in marketable securities - The Company invests its surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of highly rated marketable securities, including corporate bonds, with maturities of generally up to three years, and variable rate demand notes with weekly resets of interest rates and \u201cputs\u2019 to redeem the investment each week. Nonetheless, such investments could become impaired in the event of certain adverse economic and/or geopolitical events which, if severe, would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\n\u25cf Risk of further losses in Spain - The Company has restructured its Spanish subsidiary and is exploring a variety of programs to increase sales and profitability. These efforts thus far are resulting in reductions in operating losses, and our efforts are continuing. Nonetheless, if our efforts are not successful, additional losses and impairments may be reported in the future. See also Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\n\u25cf Risk of dependence on large customers - The Company\u2019s largest customers, McLane Company,Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, and Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 37.5% of net product sales in 2020, and other large national chains are also material to the Company\u2019s sales. The loss of any of these customers, or one or more other large customers, or a material decrease in purchases by one or more large customers, could result in decreased sales and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf Risk related to acquisitions - From time to time, the Company has purchased other confectionery companies or brands. These acquisitions generally come at a high multiple of earnings and are justified based on various assumptions related to sales growth, and operating margins. Were the Company to make another acquisition and be unable to achieve the assumed sales and operating margins, it could have an adverse impact on future sales and profits. In addition, it could become necessary to record an impairment which would have a further adverse impact on reported profits.\n\u25cf Risk of \u201cslack fill\u201d litigation - The Company, as well as other confectionery and food companies, have experienced a number of plaintiff claims that certain products are sold in boxes that are not completely full, and therefore such \u201cslack filled\u201d products are misleading, and even deceptive, to the consumer. Although the Company believes that these claims are without merit and has generally been successful in litigation and court decrees, the Company could be exposed to significant legal fees to defend its position, and in the event that it is not successful, could be subject to fines and costs of settlement, including class action settlements.\n\u25cf Risk related to international operations - To the extent there are political leadership or legislative changes, social and/or political unrest, civil war, pandemics such as the Coronavirus, terrorism or significant economic or social instability in the countries in which the Company operates, the results of the Company\u2019s business in such countries could be adversely impacted. Currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could also have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s principal markets are the U.S.A., Canada, and Mexico.\n\u25cf The Company is a controlled company due to the common stock holdings of the Gordon family - The Gordon family\u2019s share ownership represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company\u2019s common stock as of December 31, 2020. As a result, the Gordon family has the power to elect the Company\u2019s directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the shareholders of the Company.\nThe factors identified above are believed to be significant factors, but not necessarily all of the significant factors, that could impact the Company\u2019s business. Unpredictable or unknown factors could also have material effects on the Company.\nAdditional significant factors that may affect the Company\u2019s operations, performance and business results include the risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the risk factors or uncertainties listed herein or listed in any document incorporated by reference herein.", "PERMNO": 14816, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "TR"}
