{"cik": "1161728", "company": "MGE ENERGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nMGE Energy and our subsidiaries, including MGE, operate in a regulated market environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. The following risk factors may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position and market price for our publicly traded securities. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, additional unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our performance or financial condition in the future.\nPandemic virus or diseases, including COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the implemented and evolving steps being taken to address it, could adversely affect our customers, our business, our financial condition and our liquidity. Possible effects include:\n\uf0b7 Reduced economic activity impacting the use of electricity and gas services\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 may have a material adverse impact on the local economy in our service area, which could impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Federal, state, and local governments have implemented mitigation measures, including quarantines or closures or reduced operations of businesses, governmental agencies and other institutions. Reduced economic\nactivity can lead to lower consumption of electricity and gas that may not be offset by residential consumption.\n\uf0b7 Delay in, and possible loss of, payments for utility service\nDuring the first several months of the pandemic, the PSCW ordered Wisconsin utilities not to charge for late payments and not to disconnect customers for non-payment, which, in combination with the economic hardship caused by quarantine or stay-at-home orders, could result in losses as those payments are received late or not at all. Further, significant delays in those payments could affect our liquidity. Although the PSCW order was lifted in July 2020, we have undertaken to continue to waive late fees until April 1, 2021.\n\uf0b7 Regulatory delays\nWe operate in a regulated environment. Delays in regulatory proceedings or the issuance of required permits or variances, due to limited operations, hours or ability to convene necessary meetings, could delay required approvals or permits and affect the timing of activities. The failure to get timely variances could expose us to fines and penalties.\n\uf0b7 Regulatory recovery of deferred costs\nCertain incurred costs are being deferred as regulatory assets for future recovery and not being recognized in the statements of income, reflecting a March 24, 2020, PSCW Order. These costs can affect our cash, but are not presently recoverable in rates. If recovery of those regulatory assets in customer rates is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these deferred costs would be recognized as a current period expense, which could be material in the period in which such recognition is required.\n\uf0b7 Employee and supplier disruptions\nEmployee absences and supply interruptions could affect our ability to operate and maintain our system.\n\uf0b7 Volatility in the capital markets\nConcerns about COVID-19 and its effects have caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in the capital markets. Market volatility as a result of COVID-19 may have a material adverse impact on the value of our employee benefits trusts investments, which could impact our costs for those benefits. The price of our common stock has been volatile. The COVID-19 pandemic and the significant uncertainties it has caused for the global economy, business activity, and business confidence have had, and are likely to continue to have, a significant effect on the market price of securities generally, including our securities.\nThe situation around COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity increases the longer the virus disrupts the local economy. Although we expect sales for future periods in 2021 to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the actual impact COVID-19 may have on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak, business and workforce disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease.\nMoreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks described in this section including, but not limited to, interest rate changes, rating agency actions, governmental actions and market volatility.\nRegulatory Risk\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in our business, which affects our costs and responsiveness to changing events and circumstances.\nOur business is subject to regulation at the State and Federal levels. We are subject to regulation as a holding company by the PSCW. The PSCW regulates MGE's rates, terms and conditions of service; various business practices and transactions; financing; and transactions between it and its affiliates, including MGE Energy. MGE is also subject to regulation by the FERC, which regulates certain aspects of its business. ATC, in which we have an investment, is subject to regulation by FERC as to, among other things, rates. The regulations adopted by the State and Federal agencies affect how we do business, our ability to undertake specified actions since pre-approval or authorization may be required for projects, the costs of operations, and the rates charged to recover those costs. Our ability to attract capital also depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain a fair return from the PSCW.\nOur utility revenues are subject to regulatory proceedings, which can affect our ability to recover, and the timing of recovery of, costs that we incur in our operations.\nOur utility customer rates have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Our ability to obtain adjustments to those rates depends upon timely regulatory action under applicable statues and regulations. Rate regulation is based on providing an opportunity to recover costs that have been reasonably incurred and the ability to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, we have no assurance that our regulators will consider all of our costs to have been reasonably incurred. In addition, our rate proceedings may not always result in rates that fully recover our costs or provide a reasonable return on equity. Certain costs and revenues are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. If recovery of regulatory assets is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these costs would be recognized as a current period expense and could materially and adversely impact our operations and financial performance in that period.\nWe could be subject to higher costs and potential penalties resulting from mandatory reliability standards.\nMGE must adhere in its electric distribution system to mandatory reliability standards established by NERC. These standards cover areas such as critical infrastructure protection, emergency preparedness, facility design, and transmission operations, among others. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on physical and access security of cyber assets, as well as incident response and recovery planning. Compliance with these standards affects operating costs and any noncompliance can result in sanctions, including monetary penalties.\nWe are subject to changing environmental laws and regulations that may affect our costs and business plans.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect the manner in which we conduct business, including capital expenditures, operating costs, and potential liabilities. Based upon early announcements, the new presidential administration is expected to undertake an active effort on climate change-related matters, including restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon. While it is difficult to know the extent of possible legislation or regulatory activity, it is expected there will be an increase in the number and scope of environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may alter or limit our business plans, make them more costly, or expose us to liabilities for past, present, or future operations.\nNumerous environmental laws and regulations govern many aspects of our present and future operations. These include: air emissions limits and reporting; ambient air quality standards; water quality; water intake and discharges; wetlands; solid and hazardous waste; handling and disposal of hazardous substances; protection of endangered resources, such as threatened and endangered species, protection of cultural resources and archaeological sites; remediation and management of contaminated sites; and control of potential pollution from electric and gas construction sites. These evolving regulations affect us by:\n\uf0b7 Introducing uncertainty into our planning and capital expenditures processes, as changes in requirements may affect the timing and choice of compliance methods and require costly revisions to prior plans and commitments.\n\uf0b7 Imposing or modifying limits on the operations of our facilities in order to meet restrictions on air emissions, water use or water discharges.\n\uf0b7 Requiring capital expenditures and changes in operating procedures and costs as a result of the need to install additional pollution controls or more advanced technology or equipment at new or existing facilities.\n\uf0b7 Mandating increasing purchases of renewable energy, which affects the use of existing generation, and energy efficiency initiatives, which affect revenues.\nWe may be subject to future laws, regulations, or actions associated with public concern with fossil-fuel generation, greenhouse gases, and the effects of global climate change.\nOur subsidiaries operate or co-own electric power plants that burn fossil fuels, deliver natural gas, and deliver electricity to customers. These business activities are subject to evolving public concern regarding greenhouse gases (GHG), legislative and regulatory action, and possible litigation in response to that public concern. The primary greenhouse gas associated with our subsidiaries' combustion of fossil fuels, and the largest emission in our system overall, is carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOur subsidiaries have incurred and are expected to continue to incur costs from more stringent regulation of GHG from power plants, natural gas delivery, greenhouse gases used in power distribution, and efficiencies lost during power distribution. While it is difficult to know the extent of possible legislation or regulatory activity, the federal government is likely to consider and pass some form of greenhouse gas legislation or regulations. In addition, litigation by environmental nongovernment organizations targeting GHG emissions from the electric power industry is also likely if the federal government fails to act on greenhouse gas initiatives.\nClimate change could affect us in several other ways:\n\uf0b7 Changes in weather patterns, including swings in intensity, could affect use of electricity and gas by our customers, affecting revenues; and could affect the condition of our facilities, affecting our costs.\n\uf0b7 We may also incur costs associated with actions taken due to investor interest in reducing our subsidiaries' reliance on fossil fuel generation, and coal in particular. Investors may also move away from investing in fossil fuel generated electricity for reputational or perceived risk-related reasons, which could raise our costs of attracting capital.\n\uf0b7 If we are not seen as being proactive in addressing concerns, we may experience reputational issues among our customers and the communities that we serve. Those issues could affect customers' energy choices, including efforts at self-supply, and could affect the handling and treatment of our rate requests and cost recovery.\nThese matters represent uncertainties in the operation and management of our business.\nWe face risk for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.\nMGE has price risk exposure with respect to the price of natural gas, electricity, coal, emission credits, and oil. MGE burns natural gas in several of its peak electric generation facilities. In many cases, the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas. In the event of an interruption in energy supply, whether due to equipment problems, transmission constraints, or otherwise, we may incur additional costs to obtain alternative sources of energy supply, in order to meet our contractual or regulatory obligations to our customers. Under the electric fuel rules, MGE would defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a symmetrical cost tolerance band. The tolerance band is defined by the PSCW and has been modified throughout the years based on market conditions and other relevant factors. Beginning in 2021, MGE is subject to a plus or minus 1% range. Prior to 2021, the range was set at 2%. Any over- or under-recovery of the actual costs in a year is determined in the following year and is then reflected in future billings to electric retail customers. Under the electric fuel rules, MGE would defer the benefit of lower costs, if its actual fuel costs fall outside the lower end of the range, and is required to defer costs, less any excess revenues, if its actual fuel costs exceed the upper end of the range. Excess revenues are defined as revenues in the year in question that provide MGE with a greater return on common equity than authorized by the PSCW in MGE's latest rate order. MGE assumes the risks and benefits of variances that are within the cost tolerance band.\nChanges in federal income tax policy may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our subsidiaries' credit ratings.\nWe currently own and operate renewable energy generating facilities. These facilities generate production tax credits and investment tax credits that we use to reduce our federal tax obligations. The amount of tax credits we\nearn depends on multiple factors, including facility generation, the cost of qualifying property, and the applicable tax credit rate. The disallowance of these tax credits in whole or in part as a result of changes in tax law or regulation could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows.\nIf corporate tax rates or policies are changed with future federal or state legislation, we may be required to take material charges against earnings. The 2017 Tax Act is still being interpreted and implemented by the IRS as well as state income tax authorities, and the 2017 Tax Act could continue to be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.\nThere is still uncertainty as to when or how credit rating agencies, capital markets, the FERC, or state public utility commissions will treat any additional impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. These impacts could subject us or any of our subsidiaries to further credit rating downgrades. It is unclear whether additional opportunities may evolve for us to manage the adverse impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. In addition, certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies, such as our funds from operations-to-debt percentage, could be negatively impacted by future rulings related to the 2017 Tax Act.\nWe may not be able to use all tax credits for which we are eligible.\nWe have historically reduced our consolidated federal and state income tax liability with the use of various tax credits under the applicable tax codes. We may not be able to fully use tax credits if our future federal and state taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit their use. In addition, any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credits as a result of legislation or an adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions could materially affect our tax obligations and financial results.\nOperating Risk\nWe are affected by weather, which affects customer demand and can affect the operation of our facilities.\nThe demand for electricity and gas is affected by weather. Very warm and very cold temperatures, especially for prolonged periods, can dramatically increase the demand for electricity and gas for cooling and heating, respectively, as opposed to the softening effect of more moderate temperatures. Our electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season and, to a lesser extent, the winter heating season. Similarly, very cold temperatures can dramatically increase the demand for gas for heating. A significant portion of our gas system demand is driven by heating. Extreme summer conditions or storms may stress electric systems, resulting in increased maintenance costs and limiting the ability to meet peak customer demand.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in the development, and utilization by our customers, of power generation, storage, and use technologies.\nOur revenues and the timing of the recovery of our costs could be adversely affected by improvements in power generation, storage, and use technology.\nAdvancements in power generation technology, including commercial and residential solar generation installations and commercial micro turbine installations, are improving the cost-effectiveness of customer self-supply of electricity. Improvements in energy storage technology, including batteries and fuel cells, could also better position customers to meet their around-the-clock electricity requirements. Improvements in the energy efficiency of lighting, appliances, and equipment will also affect energy consumption by customers. Such developments could reduce customer purchases of electricity but may not necessarily reduce our investment and operating requirements due to our obligation to serve customers, including those self-supply customers whose equipment has failed for any reason to provide the power they need whether due to inadequate on-site resources, restricted operating hours, or equipment failure. In addition, since a portion of our costs are recovered through charges based upon the volume of power delivered, a reduction in electricity deliveries will affect the timing of our recovery of those costs and may require changes to our rate structures.\nChanges in power generation, storage, and use technologies could have significant effects on customer behaviors and their energy consumption. Customers could engage in individual conservation efforts by voluntarily reducing their consumption of electricity through changes in energy use and through the use of more energy efficient\nlighting, appliances, and equipment. They could also change their consumption of electricity from us through the installation of alternative energy sources, such as rooftop solar panels and micro turbines for self-supply. Customer energy conservation could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our revenues without necessarily changing our operating costs due to our obligation to serve.\nWe are affected by economic activity within our service area.\nHigher levels of development and business activity generally increase the numbers of customers and their use of electricity and gas. Likewise, recessionary economic conditions generally have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe ability to obtain an adequate supply of coal could limit the ability to operate the co-owned coal-fired facilities from which we receive a significant portion of our electric supply.\nThe availability of coal and the means to transport coal could:\n\uf0b7 Affect our operating costs due to increased costs associated with lower levels of generation or the need for alternate supply or alternate transportation,\n\uf0b7 Limit the ability to generate electricity if the plant operator is unable to arrange adequate deliveries of coal, and\n\uf0b7 Result in potentially higher costs for replacement purchased power as well as potential lost market sales opportunities.\nA significant portion of our electric generating capacity is dependent on coal. Demand for coal has been impacted by prevailing prices for natural gas and coal plant closures and may affect mine performance. Consequently, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to these contracts will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of our fuel suppliers, could limit our ability to generate electricity at our facilities at the desired level. Should counterparties fail to perform, or other unplanned disruptions occur, we may be forced to fulfill the underlying obligation at higher prices. The plant operators may also be forced to reduce generation at our jointly-held coal units, which would cause us to replace this generation through additional power purchases from third parties. These factors may also affect the terms under which any of the existing coal supply or transportation agreements are renewed or replaced upon the expiration of their current terms.\nOur ability to manage our purchased power costs is influenced by a number of uncontrollable factors.\nWe are exposed to additional purchased power costs to the extent that our power needs cannot be fully covered by the supplies available from our existing facilities and contractual arrangements. Those needs, and our costs, could be affected by:\n\uf0b7 Increased demand due to, for example, abnormal weather, customer growth, or customer obligations,\n\uf0b7 The inability to transmit our owned or contracted power from the generation source to our customers due to transmission line constraints, outages, or equipment failures,\n\uf0b7 Reductions in the availability of power from our owned or contracted generation sources due to equipment failures, shortages of fuel or environmental limitations on operations, and\n\uf0b7 Failure to perform on the part of any party from which we purchase capacity or energy, whether due to equipment failures or other causes.\nAn unexpected change in demand or the availability of generation or transmission facilities can expose us to increased costs of sourcing electricity in the short-term market where pricing may be more volatile.\nThe equipment and facilities in our operational system are subject to risks that may adversely affect our financial performance.\nWeather conditions, accidents, and catastrophic events can result in damage or failures of equipment or facilities and disrupt or limit our ability to generate, transmit, transport, purchase, or distribute electricity and gas. Efforts\nto repair or replace equipment and facilities may take place over prolonged periods or may be unsuccessful. We may also be unable to make the necessary improvements to our operational system, causing service interruptions. Furthermore, our facilities are interconnected with third-party transmission providers. Damage to or failures of these providers' equipment or facilities is out of our control but could lead to service interruptions. The resulting interruption of services would result in lost revenues and additional costs. We are also exposed to the risk of accidents or other incidents that could result in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons or property. Such issues could adversely affect revenues or increase costs to repair and maintain our systems.\nWe could be adversely affected by production disruptions at our wind generating facilities.\nWe own and operate wind generating facilities, which generate production tax credits used to reduce our federal tax obligations. Various operating and economic factors, including transmission constraints, unfavorable trends in pricing for wind energy, adverse weather conditions and the breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce the production tax credits generated by our wind farms, resulting in increased federal income tax expense. We could also be forced to replace lost wind generation capacity with additional power purchases from third parties, potentially leading to increased costs. These factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, which could be material depending upon the cause of the disruption and its duration.\nOur operations and confidential information are subject to the risk of cyber-attacks.\nOur operations rely on sophisticated information technology systems and networks. Cyber-attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, including denial of service and ransomware attacks, could result in a full or partial disruption of our operations. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and loss of revenue, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders, and employees, who expect that we will adequately protect such information. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may cause our business reputation to be adversely impacted and could lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons. The occurrence of such an event may cause us to become subject to legal claims, fines, or penalties, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe safeguards we have may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber-attacks. We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber-attack. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber-attack, and not be recovered in a timely fashion, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised, adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the performance of our information technology systems, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business and performance.\nWe operate in a highly engineered industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to manage our finances, to operate our control facilities, to provide electric and gas service to our customers, and to enable compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Our computer-based systems are vulnerable to interruption or failure due to the age of certain systems, the introduction of viruses, malware, ransomware, security breaches, fire, power loss, system malfunction, network outages and other events that may be beyond our control. System interruptions or failures, whether isolated or more widespread, could impact our ability to provide service to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nCatastrophic and unpredictable events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA terrorist attack, war, natural disaster, pandemic virus or disease, or other catastrophic or unpredictable event could adversely affect our future revenues, expenses and operating results by: interrupting our normal business operations; causing employee absences or casualties, including loss of our key employees; interrupting or affecting\nsupplier operations; requiring substantial expenditures and expenses to repair, replace and restore normal business operations; and reducing investor confidence. Facilities for electric generation, transmission, and gas and electric distribution are potential targets of terrorist threats and activities. A terrorist act or catastrophic event at our facilities or the facilities of other companies to which we are interconnected could result in a disruption of our ability to generate, transmit, transport, purchase, or distribute electricity or natural gas. Such an event would have additional adverse effects, including environmental ramifications, increased security and insurance costs, as well as general economic volatility or uncertainty within our service territories. The inability to maintain operational continuity and any additional costs incurred for repairing our facilities or making alternative arrangements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risk in connection with the completion of significant capital projects.\nOur capital projects, such as our renewable generation projects, are subject to various risks that could cause costs to increase or delays in completion. These risks include shortages of, the inability to obtain, the cost of, and the consistency of, labor, materials and equipment; the inability of the contractors to perform under their contracts; the inability to agree to terms of contracts or disputes in contract terms; work stoppages; adverse weather conditions; the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner; changes in applicable laws or regulations; adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions; governmental actions; legal action; and unforeseen engineering or technology issues. In the case of our renewable generation projects, we may face delays in the completion of the necessary transmission system connection or upgrades to accommodate the project.\nIf a capital project exceeds the approved project costs approved by the PSCW, we may not be able to recover those excess costs through regulated customer rates. If that happens, we may have to finance overruns through cash from operations, which may delay other projects, or by securing additional financing. Any or all of these methods may not be available when or in the amounts needed or may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInability to recover excess costs, or inability to complete the project in a timely manner, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately following our expenditure of funds on a particular project, which could affect our liquidity and financial position.\nOur stated long-term goals are based on various assumptions and beliefs that may not prove to be achievable in the time frame projected.\nSome of our current long-term goals include MGE's targeting of a net-zero carbon electricity by 2050 and MGE's Energy 2030 framework, which describes our plan for growth in renewables generation. MGE is working to achieve a more sustainable energy future using cost-effective renewable generation technologies. Management established these goals in conjunction with our board of directors based upon a number of different internal and external factors that characterize and influence our current and expected future activities. These long-term goals are based on certain assumptions regarding the timing, scope and relative costs of technological advancements, including generation, storage and energy use technologies; levels of customer participation in programs and partnerships, which will be critical to the achievement of the goals; our ability to transition or displace existing coal-fired resources on an ongoing basis; our ability to complete renewable generation projects in a timely manner and within approved budgets; our ability to obtain recovery of costs in rates; and our ability to obtain the necessary permits or licenses for such projects. These assumptions may differ materially from actual future results. Accordingly, we may not achieve our stated long-term goals in the timeframe projected or at all.\nFailure to successfully manage the implementation of our Enterprise Forward corporate initiative could adversely affect our operations.\nMGE committed to undertake a multi-year information technology project aimed at transforming our foundational customer engagement capabilities and enabling it to be flexible in delivering new products and services as outlined in our energy 2030 framework. These objectives are expected to be accomplished through the implementation of a new customer information and billing system, and enterprise resource planning platform, along with other solutions that meet the goals of the initiative. Integrating new systems is complex, costly and time consuming and could result in performance delays and errors. If the systems and related processes do not operate as intended, it could result in disruptions to our business as well as unrecoverable excess costs. Inability to recover excess capital\nand operating costs, or inability to implement the project successfully and in a timely manner, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our facilities are located, and we access certain facilities through rights-of-way which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own all of the land on which certain of our facilities are located, and we are, therefore, subject to the risk of increased costs to maintain necessary land use. We obtain the rights to construct and operate certain of our related facilities on land owned by third parties for a specific period of time. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts on acceptable terms or increased costs to renew such rights, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could affect our operations.\nAn aging workforce and the retirement of key employees without appropriate replacements may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. Some of the challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and time required for replacement employees to develop necessary skills. Failure to identify qualified replacement employees could result in decreased productivity and increased safety costs. If we are unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our operations could be negatively affected.\nFinancial Risk\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk relating to our purchases of natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and environmental allowances.\nWe face commodity price risk exposure with respect to the purchase of natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and environmental allowances. We also face risk through our use of derivatives such as futures, forwards, and swaps, to manage our commodity price risk. We could experience increased costs as a result of volatility in the market values of those commodities. We could also experience losses on our derivative contracts as a result of that market value volatility or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these derivative contracts involves our exercise of judgment and use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nOur business is concentrated in Wisconsin.\nOur business activities, including those of our subsidiaries, are concentrated in Wisconsin. Changes in the economies of Wisconsin and surrounding regions could negatively impact the growth opportunities available to us and our subsidiaries, and the financial condition of our customers and prospects.\nInterest rate movements and market performance affects our employee benefit plan costs.\nPrevailing interest rates affect our assessment and determination of discount rates and are a key assumption in the determination of the costs and funding of our defined benefit pension plans. Changes in rates may impact the amount of expense and timing of contributions to those plans. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy the future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. A decline in the market value of those assets may increase our current and longer-term funding requirements for these obligations. Changes in the value of trust fund assets may affect the level of required contributions to these trusts to meet benefit obligations. Reduced benefit plan assets could result in increased benefit costs in future years and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of required future funding contributions.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate financing. Borrowing levels under commercial paper arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Such interest rate risk means that we are exposed to increased financing costs and associated cash payments as a result of changes in\nthe short-term interest rates.\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk primarily through our regulated energy business.\nCredit risk is the loss and additional expense that may result from counterparty nonperformance. We face credit risk primarily through MGE's regulated energy business. Failure of contractual counterparties to perform their obligations under purchase power agreements, commodity supply arrangements, or other agreements may result in increased expenses for MGE as a result of being forced to cover the shortfall in the spot or short-term market, where prices may be more volatile. That risk may be increased during periods of weak or stressed economic conditions.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on upstream cash flows from our subsidiaries for the payment of dividends on our common stock.\nAs a holding company, we have no operations of our own, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent on the earnings and cash flows of our operating subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to us. Our subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied before funding us. These obligations include debt service and obligations to trade creditors, among others. Our subsidiaries are also subject to contractual and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nDisruptions in the financial markets or changes to our credit ratings may affect our ability to finance at a reasonable cost and in accordance with our planned schedule.\nThe credit markets have experienced disruption and uncertainty in prior years. To the extent that such issues affect the ability or willingness of credit providers or investors to participate in the credit markets or particular types of investments, or affect their perception of the risk associated with particular types of investments, our cost of borrowing could be affected. Furthermore, if we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt. We also rely on our credit ratings to access the credit markets. If our credit ratings are downgraded for any reason, borrowing costs would increase, the number of potential investors could decrease, or we could be required to provide additional credit assurance, including cash collateral, to contract counterparties.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events, or it may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all.\nWe may experience increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for risks that could arise from our ordinary operations. We or our contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, we are unable to predict whether we would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if we are unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nGeneral economic conditions may affect our operating revenues and our counterparty risks.\nMGE Energy's and MGE's operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. The consequences of a prolonged period of reduced economic activity may include lower demand for energy, uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets, and increased credit risk. A decline in energy consumption may adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Increased credit risk reflects the risk that our retail customers will not pay their bills in a timely manner or at all, which may lead to a reduction in liquidity and an eventual increase in bad debt expense.\nThe stock market can be volatile, and various factors could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects, including changes in conditions locally and in the broader economy. These conditions include technological change, the level of interest rates and yields on other investments, and the effects of the other risk factors discussed in this report. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to our quarterly or annual results, as well as factors affecting the broader economy that are beyond our control.", "PERMNO": 50789, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "MGEE"}
