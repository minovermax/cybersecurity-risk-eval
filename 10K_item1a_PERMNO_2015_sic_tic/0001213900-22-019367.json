{"cik": "943184", "company": "Ever-Glory International Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report before making an investment decision with regard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated into this Annual Report that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following events described in these risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nOur sales are influenced by general economic cycles. A prolonged period of depressed consumer spending would have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nApparel is a cyclical industry that is dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending. Purchase of apparel generally declines during recessionary periods when disposable income is low. Our customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by reducing inventories and canceling orders. As a result, any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions, increases in energy costs or interest rates, acts of war, acts of nature or terrorist or political events that diminish consumer spending and confidence in any of the regions in which we compete, could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition. We currently sell to customers in the U.S., the EU and Japan. Accordingly, economic conditions and consumer spending patterns in these regions could affect our sales, and an economic downturn in one or more of these regions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIntense competition in the worldwide apparel industry could reduce our sales and prices.\nWe face a variety of competitive challenges from other apparel manufacturers both in China and other countries. Some of these competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and may be able to adapt to changes in consumer preferences or retail requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. As a result, we may not be able to compete with them if we cannot continue enhancing our marketing and management strategies, quality and value or responding appropriately to consumer\u2019s needs.\nOur ability to increase our revenues and profits depends upon our ability to offer innovative and upgraded products at attractive price points.\nThe worldwide apparel industry is characterized by constant product innovation due to changing consumer preferences and by the rapid replication of new products by competitors. As a result, our growth depends in large part on our ability to continuously and rapidly respond to customer requirements for innovative and stylish products at a competitive pace, intensity, and price. Failure on our part to regularly and rapidly respond to customer requirements could adversely affect our ability to retain our existing customers or to acquire new customers which would limit our sales growth.\nThe worldwide apparel industry is subject to ongoing pricing pressure.\nThe apparel market is characterized by low barriers to entry for both suppliers and marketers, global sourcing through suppliers located throughout the world, trade liberalization, continuing movement of product sourcing to lower cost countries, ongoing emergence of new competitors with widely varying strategies and resources, and an increasing focus on apparel in the mass merchant channel of distribution. These factors contribute to ongoing pricing pressure throughout the supply chain. This pressure has and may continue to:\n\u25cf require us to reduce wholesale prices on existing products;\n\u25cf result in reduced gross margins across our product lines;\n\u25cf increase pressure on us to further reduce our production costs and our operating expenses.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability.\nWe purchase raw materials directly from local fabric and accessory suppliers. We may also import specialty fabrics to meet specific customer requirements. We also purchase finished goods from other contract manufacturers. The prices we charge for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them. The price, availability and quality of our raw materials may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, crop yields, weather patterns, supply conditions, transportation costs, government regulation, economic climates, and other unpredictable factors. Any raw material price increases could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers.\nFor the wholesale business, we did not rely on any supplier for more than 10% of all our total raw material purchases in 2021and 2020. We relied on one manufacturers for 27.0% of purchased finished goods in 2021 and two manufacturers for 12.6% and 11.2% of purchased finished goods in 2020. For the retail business, we did not rely on any one manufacturer for more than 10% of all of our total purchased finished goods during 2021nd 2020. We do not have any long-term written agreements with any of these suppliers and do not anticipate entering into any such agreements in the near future. However, we always execute a written agreement for each order placed with our suppliers. We do not believe that loss of any of these suppliers would have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain finished goods or raw materials essential to our business because we believe we can locate other suppliers in a timely manner.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur wholesale business depends on some key customers for a significant portion of our sales. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer\u2019s performance or financial position could harm our business and financial condition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our five largest customers represented approximately 37.8% of our total net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our five largest customers represented approximately38.7% of our total net sales. The garment manufacturing industry has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years, which has resulted in increased customer leverage over suppliers, greater exposure for suppliers to credit risk and an increased emphasis by customers on inventory management and productivity.\nA decision by a major customer, whether motivated by competitive considerations, strategic shifts, financial requirements or difficulties, economic conditions or otherwise, to decrease its purchases from us or to change its manner of doing business with us, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, while we have long-standing customer relationships, we do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers.\nAs a result, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis, and the relationship, as well as particular orders, can generally be terminated by either party at any time. We do not believe that there is any material risk of loss of any of these customers during the next 12 months. We also believe that the unexpected loss of these customers could have material adverse effect on our earnings or financial condition. While we believe that we could replace these customers within 12 months, the loss of which will not have material adverse effect on our financial condition in the long term. None of our affiliates are officers, directors, or material shareholders of any of these customers.\nOur business relies heavily on our ability to identify changes in fashion trends.\nOur results of operations depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion tastes by offering appropriate products. Failure to effectively follow the changing fashion trend will lead to higher seasonal inventory levels. Our continuous ability to respond to the changing customer demands constitutes a material risk to the growth of our retail business. For our wholesale business, if we are unable to swiftly respond to the changing fashion trend, the sample we designed for our customers may not be accepted or the products based on our design may be put into inventory, and thus have a negative impact on the number of orders the customers may place with us.\nOur ability to attract customers to the stores heavily depends on their location.\nOur flagship stores and the store-within-a-stores are selectively located in what we believe to be prominent locations or popular department stores to generate customer traffic. The availability and/or cost of appropriate locations for the existing or future stores may fluctuate for reasons beyond our control. If we are unable to secure these locations or to renew store leases on acceptable terms, we may not continue to attract customers, which will have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to expand our retail business by opening profitable new stores.\nOur future growth in our retail segment requires our continuous increase of new flagship stores and stores-within-a-store in selected cities, improve our operating capabilities, and retaining and hiring qualified sales personnel in these stores. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, nor any assurance that our newly opened stores will achieve revenue or profitability levels comparable to those of our existing stores. If our stores fail to achieve acceptable revenue, we may incur significant costs associated with closing those stores.\nThere may be conflicts of interest between Mr. Kang\u2019s role as the Chairman of the Board and CEO of our Company and his role as the majority owner of other entities that we do business with.\nJiangsu Ever-Glory is an entity engaged in importing/exporting, apparel-manufacture, real-estate development, car sales and other activities. Jiangsu Ever-Glory is controlled by Mr. Kang.\nThe Company and Jiangsu Ever-Glory sometimes purchase raw materials for each other in order to obtain cheaper prices. The Company purchased raw materials on Jiangsu Ever-Glory\u2019s behalf and sold to Jiangsu Ever-Glory at cost for $3.8 million and $0.9 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. Jiangsu Ever-Glory purchased raw materials on the Company\u2019s behalf and sold to the Company at cost for $0.4 million and $1.5 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn March 2012, in consideration of the guarantees and collateral provided by Jiangsu Ever-Glory and Nanjing Knitting, the Company agreed to provide Jiangsu Ever-Glory a counter guarantee in the form of cash of not less than 70% of the maximum aggregate lines of credit obtained by the Company. Jiangsu Ever-Glory is obligated to return the full amount of the counter-guarantee funds provided upon the expiration or termination of the underlying lines of credit and is to pay an annual interest at the rate of 6.0% of the amounts provided. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Jiangsu Ever-Glory had provided guarantees for approximately $0.0 million (RMB 0.0 million) and $36.0 million (RMB 235.0 million) of lines of credit obtained by the Company, respectively. Jiangsu Ever-Glory and Nanjing Knitting have also provided their assets as collateral for certain of these lines of credit. As of December 31, 2021and 2020, the value of the collateral, as per appraisals obtained by the banks in connection with these lines of credit is approximately $4.4 million (RMB 28.2 million) which was provided assets as collateral by Jiangsu Ever-Glory, and $31.5million (RMB 205.5 million)which was provided assets as collateral by Jiangsu Ever-Glory and Nanjing Knitting, respectively. Mr. Kang has also provided a personal guarantee for $0.0 million (RMB 0.0 million) and $14.8 million (RMB 96.3 million) at the years ended of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $3.1 million (RMB 20.0 million) was outstanding due from Jiangsu Ever-Glory under the counter guarantee agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2021, an additional $0.7 million (RMB 4.2million) was provided to and repayment of $3.8 million (RMB 24.2 million) was received from Jiangsu Ever-Glory under the counter-guarantee agreement. As of December 31, 2021 the amount of the counter-guarantee had decreased to $0.0 million (RMB 0.0 million) , which was 0.0% of the aggregate amount of lines of credit. This amount plus accrued interest of ($0.3) million (2021) and $0.04 million (2020) have been classified as a reduction of equity, consistent with the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins 4E and 4G. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount classified as a reduction of equity was $0.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Interest of 0.5% is charged on net amounts due from Jiangsu Ever-Glory at each month end. Since January 1, 2019, the interest rate has changed to 0.3625% as the bank benchmark interest rate decreased. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately ($0.3) million and $0.04 million, respectively.\nIt is possible that the terms of the export and import agency transactions and the counter guarantee may not be the same as those that would result from transactions between unrelated parties. Despite of Mr. Kang\u2019s fiduciary duty to us as the CEO and a director, in the event of any conflicts of interests between us and Jiangsu Ever-Glory, he may not act in our best interests and such conflicts of interests may not be resolved in our favor. These conflicts may result in management decisions that could negatively affect our operations.\nFor a further discussion of these related party transactions, see Notes 12 Related party transactions in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements and Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nIn case Jiangsu Ever-Glory fails to repay the fund we provided to it under the Counter Guarantee Agreement according to its terms, we will suffer significant financial losses.\nDespite of management\u2019s belief that Jiangsu Ever-Glory is financially capable of repaying all amount we provided under the counter guarantee and Jiangsu Ever-Glory\u2019s repayment certain portion of the fund by the end of first quarter of 2021, it is possible that we would not be able to collect all amount from Jiangsu Ever-Glory due to factors beyond our control. There is no restriction on how Jiangsu Ever-Glory can use the fund except that it is not allowed to invest in high-risk investments. We were told that Jiangsu Ever-Glory had used the entire amount of the fund we provided under the counter guarantee for its own operations. It is possible that we will not be able to collect the entire amount from Jiangsu Ever-Glory due to reasons beyond its control such as its operational failure or deterioration of the overall economic conditions. In such event, we, as the primary obligor under the lines of credit, would be obligated to repay the entire outstanding borrowing after the banks seek collection from the assets collateralized by Jiangsu Ever-Glory. As a result, we may suffer financial losses which will have material negative effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nExpansion of both our wholesale and retail business depends on our ability to obtain continuous financing at acceptable terms. Failure to do so will result in negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe have historically relied on debt financing from Chinese banks to satisfy our financing needs. Due to Chinese banks\u2019 stringent underwriting policy to non-state-owned businesses, borrowers generally have to provide properties and land use rights as collaterals or obtain third party guarantees from either high-net-worth individuals or businesses with strong credits with the banks. Although we have certain properties and land use rights to be used as collateral, the value of those properties is not high enough for us to obtain sufficient bank loans to support our projected growth. Therefore, Mr. Kang previously provided personal guarantees and Jiangsu Ever-Glory provided personal guarantees and assets collateral as security interests for the bank loans. In the event Mr. Kang or Jiangsu Ever-Glory refuses to provide sufficient security interests in the future or continue the guarantee and collateral provided in the past, we may not be able to obtain the bank loans on acceptable terms as required by our business plan. As a result, we may have to delay or reduce our retail expansion and limit our wholesale development which may materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel, and our ability to grow and compete will be harmed if we do not retain the continued services of such personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts and expertise of our management team. The loss of services of one or more members of this team, each of whom have substantial experience in the garment industry, could have an adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified management or if any member of our management leaves, such departure could have an adverse effect on our operations. In particular, we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and strategic guidance of our CEO and Chairman of the Board, Mr. Edward Yihua Kang.\nOur ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising and marketing areas. In addition, if we experience material growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. The market for qualified and talented design and marketing personnel in the apparel industry is intensely competitive, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel as needed, our growth will be hampered and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to protect our trademark and maintain the value of our retail brands, our retail sales are likely to decline.\nWe intend to vigorously protect our registered trademarks against infringement, but we may be unable to do so. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our trademarks would diminish the value of our brands, which could reduce demand for our products or the prices at which we can sell our products. Our ability to grow our retail operation significantly depends on the value and image of the brands. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain and promote the brands by marketing efforts.\nFailure to maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems may have an adverse effect on our operation.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations, and we regularly evaluate these systems against our current and expected requirements. Although we have no current plans to implement modifications or upgrades to our systems, we will eventually be required to make changes to legacy systems and acquire new systems with new functionality. We are considering additional investments in updating our ERP system to help us improve our internal control system and to meet compliance requirements under Section 404. We are also continuing to develop and update our internal information systems on a timely basis to meet our business expansion needs. Any information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions and strategic investments that dilute the ownership percentage of our shareholders and require the use of cash, incur debt or assume contingent liabilities.\nAs part of our business strategy, we expect to continue to review opportunities to buy or invest in other businesses or technologies that we believe would enhance our manufacturing capabilities, or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities. If we buy or invest in other businesses in the future, this may require the use of cash, or we may incur debt or assume contingent liabilities.\nAs part of our business strategy, we expect to continue to review opportunities to buy or invest in other businesses or technologies that we believe would complement our current products, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities, or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities. If we buy or invest in other businesses, products or technologies in the future, we could:\n\u25cf incur significant unplanned expenses and personnel costs;\n\u25cf issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u25cf use cash, which may result in a reduction of our liquidity;\n\u25cf incur debt; assume liabilities; and\n\u25cf spend resources on unconsummated transactions.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and strategic investments, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe may in the future acquire or make strategic investments in additional companies. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of these or any other acquisitions or strategic investments, which involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf our inability to integrate the purchased operations, technologies, personnel or products into our existing operations and/or over geographically disparate locations;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs, litigation and other contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf incurrence of acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\n\u25cf inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business; and\n\u25cf potential loss of our key employees or the key employees of an acquired organization;\nIf we are not be able to integrate businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire, or to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nChanges in international trade policies and international barriers to trade, or the emergence of a trade war, may have an adverse effect on our business and expansion plans.\nPolitical events, international trade disputes, and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on us and our customers, service providers, and other partners. International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures which may materially and adversely affect our business. Tariffs could increase the cost of the goods and products which could affect customers\u2019 spending levels. In addition, political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and the potential of the escalation to trade war and global recession could have a negative effect on customer confidence, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We may have also access to fewer business opportunities, and our operations may be negatively impacted as a result. In addition, the current and future actions or escalations by either the United States or China that affect trade relations may cause global economic turmoil and potentially have a negative impact on our markets, our business, or our results of operations, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take.\nInternational political instability and concerns about other international crises may increase our cost of doing business and disrupt our business.\nInternational political instability may halt or hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs. Various events, including the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks, increased national security measures in the EU, the United States and other countries, and military action and armed conflicts, can suddenly increase international tensions. Increases in energy prices will also impact our costs and could harm our operating results. In addition, concerns about other international crises, such as the global outbreak of COVID-19, spread of avian influenza, or bird flu, and West Nile viruses, may have an adverse effect on the world economy and could adversely affect our business operations or the operations of our OEM partners, contract manufacturer and suppliers. This political instability and concerns about other international crises may, for example:\n\u25cf negatively affect the reliability and cost of transportation;\n\u25cf negatively affect the desire and ability of our employees and customers to travel;\n\u25cf adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate insurance at reasonable rates;\n\u25cf require us to take extra security precautions for our operations; and\n\u25cf furthermore, to the extent that air or sea transportation is delayed or disrupted, our operations may be disrupted, particularly if shipments of our products are delayed.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control. In the event of a major natural disaster, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and loss of life. In the event that a material business interruption occurs that affects us or our suppliers or customers, shipments could be delayed, and our business and financial results could be harmed.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic adversely impacted our business in fiscal year 2021. Among other things, the product manufacturing, logistics and fulfillment of us and certain third-party merchants and brands that cooperated with us were adversely affected due to various travel restrictions and quarantine measures imposed in China. We have implemented preventative measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and made appropriate adjustments to our business operations in response to the pandemic\u2019s impact.\nWhile we have seen gradual recovery of our overall business resulting from improving health statistics in China since March 2020, the pandemic continued to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations for the past few months and we anticipate the negative impact of the pandemic may continue. As a result, our results of operations for fiscal year 2022 and any period thereof could be worse than our results of operations for fiscal year 2021 and corresponding periods thereof.\nThe duration and magnitude of the impact from the pandemic on our business will depend on numerous evolving factors that cannot be accurately predicted or assessed, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the negative impact it has on the Chinese and global economy, its impact on unemployment and consumer confidence, our ability to successfully navigate the impact of the pandemic, as well as actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions, including as a result of health and safety concerns, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of our control, such as the impact of health and safety concerns from the outbreak of COVID-19. The outbreak in China has resulted in the reduction of customer traffic and temporary closures of shopping malls as mandated by the provincial governments in various provinces of China from late January to March 2020, which had adversely affected our retail business with a decline in sales since February 2020. Our wholesale business is also significantly affected as we were facing a sharp decline in our order quantities. Some of our wholesale clients cancelled or postponed orders with us. Due to the Chinese factories\u2019 shutdowns and traffic restrictions during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China and potential shutdowns and traffic restrictions in the countries where our suppliers are located, our supply chain and business operations of our suppliers may be affected from time to time. Disruptions from the closure of supplier and manufacturer facilities, interruptions in the supply of raw materials and components, personnel absences, or restrictions on the shipment of our or our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 products, could have adverse ripple effects on our manufacturing output and delivery schedule. We also face difficulties in collecting our accounts receivables due to the effects of COVID-19 on our customers and risk gaining a large amount of bad debt. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries and localities in which we or our suppliers and customers operate.\nAlthough China has already begun to recover from the outbreak of COVID-19, the epidemic continues to spread on a global scale and there is the risk of the epidemic returning to China in the future, thereby causing further business interruption. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. If our future sales continue to decline significantly, we may risk facing bankruptcy due to our recurring fixed expenses. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on many factors and future developments, including new information about COVID-19 and any new government regulations which may emerge to contain the virus, among others.\nChanges to United States tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nThe current political climate has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, especially to trade between U.S. and China. Our products are sold to many countries including the U.S. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported products or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nOur failure to comply with cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are subject relating various risks and costs associated with to the collection, use, sharing, retention, security, and transfer of confidential and private information, such as personal information and other data. This data is wide ranging and relates to our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties and third parties. Our compliance obligations include those relating to the relevant PRC laws in this regard. These PRC laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries in China, and among us, our subsidiaries in China, and other parties with which we have commercial relations. These laws continue to develop, and the PRC government may adopt other rules and restrictions in the future. Non-compliance could result in penalties or other significant legal liabilities.\nPursuant to the PRC Cybersecurity Law, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress on November 7, 2016 and took effect on June 1, 2017, personal information and important data collected and generated by a critical information infrastructure operator in the course of its operations in China must be stored in China, and if a critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services that affects or may affect national security, it should be subject to cybersecurity review by the CAC. Due to the lack of further interpretations, the exact scope of \u201ccritical information infrastructure operator\u201d remains unclear. On December 28, 2021, the CAC and other relevant PRC governmental authorities jointly promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures (the \u201cnew Cybersecurity Review Measures\u201d) to replace the original Cybersecurity Review Measures. The new Cybersecurity Review Measures took effect on February 15, 2022. Pursuant to the new Cybersecurity Review Measures, if critical information infrastructure operators purchase network products and services, or network platform operators conduct data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, they will be subject to cybersecurity review. A network platform operator holding more than one million users/users\u2019 individual information also shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. The cybersecurity review will evaluate, among others, the risk of critical information infrastructure, core data, important data, or a large amount of personal information being influenced, controlled or maliciously used by foreign governments and risk of network data security after going public overseas.\nIn addition, the PRC Data Security Law, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress on June 10, 2021 and took effect on September 1, 2021, requires data collection to be conducted in a legitimate and proper manner, and stipulates that, for the purpose of data protection, data processing activities must be conducted based on data classification and hierarchical protection system for data security. As the Data Security Law was recently promulgated, we may be required to make further adjustments to our business practices to comply with this law. If our data processing activities were found to be not in compliance with this law, we could be ordered to make `corrections, and under certain serious circumstances, such as severe data divulgence, we could be subject to penalties, including the revocation of our business licenses or other permits. Furthermore, the recently issued Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law require (i) speeding up the revision of the provisions on strengthening the confidentiality and archives management relating to overseas issuance and listing of securities and (ii) improving the laws and regulations relating to data security, cross-border data flow, and management of confidential information. As there remain uncertainties regarding the further interpretation and implementation of those laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be compliant such new regulations in all respects, and we may be ordered to rectify and terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by the regulatory authorities and become subject to fines and other sanctions. As a result, we may be required to suspend our relevant businesses, shut down our website, take down our operating applications, or face other penalties, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of China promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law of the PRC, or the PIPL, which took effect in November 2021. As the first systematic and comprehensive law specifically for the protection of personal information in the PRC, the PIPL provides, among others, that (i) an individual\u2019s consent shall be obtained to use sensitive personal information, such as biometric characteristics and individual location tracking, (ii) personal information operators using sensitive personal information shall notify individuals of the necessity of such use and impact on the individual\u2019s rights, and (iii) where personal information operators reject an individual\u2019s request to exercise his or her rights, the individual may file a lawsuit with a People\u2019s Court. As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of the PIPL, we cannot assure you that we will comply with the PIPL in all respects, we may become subject to fines and/or other penalties which may have material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nWhile we take measures to comply with all applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the measures undertaken by us. However, compliance with any additional laws could be expensive, and may place restrictions on our business operations and the manner in which we interact with our users. In addition, any failure to comply with applicable cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by government authorities or others, including notification for rectification, confiscation of illegal earnings, fines, or other penalties and legal liabilities against us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our common stock. In addition, any negative publicity on our website or platform\u2019s safety or privacy protection mechanism and policy could harm our public image and reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe ongoing trade war between China and the United States, and its potential escalation internationally, may have an adverse effect on our business operations and revenues.\nThe U.S. government has imposed, and has proposed to impose additional, new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from China to penalize China for what it characterizes as unfair trade practices. China has responded by imposing, and proposing to impose additional, new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the U.S. Certain tariffs have already been adopted by both sides, and the two countries often meet to negotiate arrangements that would include the decreasing or removal of tariffs, but we cannot assure you that the negotiations will be successful in reducing tariffs or that other tariffs will not be imposed, even if an agreement will be reached. On October 11, 2019, the U.S. government announced that the two countries had reached a \u201cPhase 1\u201d agreement, which was signed on January 16, 2020. However, due to various political developments, including a new administration in the U.S. government, it remains to be unclear whether any \u201cPhase 2\u201d agreement will be negotiated and how much economic relief from the trade war it will offer. Any further actions to increase existing tariffs or impose additional tariffs could result in an escalation of the trade conflict, which would have an adverse effect on the global economy.\nSpecifically, the current and future actions or escalations by either the United States or China that affect trade relations may cause or contribute to further slowdowns in Chinese economic growth, the depreciation of the RMB and global economic turmoil, which has the potential to adversely impact our supply chain for our products and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we cannot provide any assurance as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take.\nThe economic, political and social conditions in the PRC, as well as government policies, laws and regulations, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A majority of our business operations are in the PRC and especially our production operations. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects are, to a significant degree, subject to economic, political and legal developments in the PRC. The economy of the PRC differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the extent of government involvement, its level of development, its growth rate and its control over foreign exchange. The PRC\u2019s economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. In recent years, the Chinese Government has implemented measures emphasizing market forces for economic reform, the reduction of State ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises. However, a significant portion of productive assets in the PRC is still owned by the Chinese Government. The Chinese Government continues to play a significant role in regulating industrial development. It also exercises significant control over the PRC\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policies and providing preferential treatments to particular industries or companies. All of these factors could affect the economic conditions in the PRC and, in turn, our business.\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC domestic residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners to personal liability, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.\nIn 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (\u201cSAFE Circular 37\u201d). SAFE Circular 37 requires residents of China to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d The term \u201ccontrol\u201d under SAFE Circular 37 is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by residents of China in the offshore special purpose vehicles or Chinese companies by such means as acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any changes with respect to the basic information of or any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as an increase or decrease of capital contributed by China residents, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material events. If the shareholders of the offshore holding company who are residents of China do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the Chinese subsidiaries may be prohibited from making distributions of profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore parent company and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the offshore parent company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its Chinese subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under Chinese law for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.\nCertain residents of China may hold direct or indirect interests in our company, and we will request residents of China who we know hold direct or indirect interests in our company, if any, to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under SAFE Circular 37 and other related rules. However, we may not at all times be fully aware or informed of the identities of our shareholders or beneficial owners that are required to make such registrations, and we cannot provide any assurance that these residents will comply with our requests to make or obtain any applicable registrations or comply with other requirements under SAFE Circular 37 or other related rules. The failure or inability of our China resident shareholders to comply with the registration procedures set forth in these regulations may subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrictions on our cross-border investment activities or those of our China subsidiaries and limitations on the ability of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China to distribute dividends or the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us, and we may also be prohibited from injecting additional capital into these subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liability under Chinese law for circumventing applicable foreign exchange restrictions. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to our investors and other holders could be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause our assets are located overseas, shareholders may not receive distributions that they would otherwise be entitled to if we were declared bankrupt or insolvent.\nOur assets are, for the most part, located in the PRC. Because our assets are located overseas, our assets may be outside of the jurisdiction of U.S. courts if we are the subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. As a result, if we declared bankruptcy or insolvency, our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the U.S., under U.S. bankruptcy law.\nExport quotas imposed by WTO and countries where our customers are located may negatively affect our business and operations, particularly if the Chinese government changes its allocation of such quotas to us.\nPursuant to a World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) agreement, effective January 1, 2005, the United States and other WTO member countries agreed to remove quotas applicable to textiles. However, as the removal of quotas resulted in an import surge from China, the U.S. took action in May 2005, and imposed safeguard quotas on seven categories of goods, including certain classes of apparel products, arousing strong objection from China. In 2008, US and EU both lifted these safeguard quotas on products from China. However, there is no assurance that any quota or additional trade restrictions will not be imposed on the exportation of our products in the future. Such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.\nAll of our business operations are currently conducted in the PRC, under the jurisdiction of the PRC government. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in China. China\u2019s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, and control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. Since early 2004, the PRC government has implemented certain measures to control the pace of economic growth. Such measures may cause a decrease in the level of economic activity in China, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic growth in China may increase our costs of doing business, and may negatively impact our profit margins and/or profitability.\nOur business depends in part upon the availability of relatively low-cost labor and materials. Rising wages in China may increase our overall costs of production. In addition, rising raw material costs, due to strong demand and greater scarcity, may increase our overall costs of production. If we are not able to pass these costs on to our customers in the form of higher prices, our profit margins and/or profitability could decline.\nIncreases in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe economy in China has experienced increases in inflation and labor costs in recent years. As a result, average wages in the PRC are expected to continue to increase. In addition, we are required by PRC laws and regulations to pay various statutory employee benefits, including pension, housing fund, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance to designated government agencies for the benefit of our employees. The relevant government agencies may examine whether an employer has made adequate payments to the statutory employee benefits, and those employers who fail to make adequate payments may be subject to late payment fees, fines and/or other penalties. We expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Unless we are able to control our labor costs or pass on these increased labor costs to our users by increasing the fees of our services, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFluctuation in the value of Chinese RMB relative to other currencies may have a material adverse effect on our business and/or an investment in our shares.\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. Dollar, the Euro and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. In the last decade, the RMB has been pegged at RMB 6.9762 to one U.S. Dollar. Following the removal of the peg to the U.S. Dollar and pressure from the United States, the People\u2019s Bank of China also announced that the RMB would be pegged to a basket of foreign currencies, rather than being strictly tied to the U.S. Dollar, and would be allowed to float trade within a narrow 0.3% daily band against this basket of currencies. The PRC government has stated that the basket is dominated by the U.S. Dollar, the Euro, Japanese Yen and South Korean Won, with a smaller proportion made up of the British Pound, Thai Baht, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Singapore Dollar. There can be no assurance that the relationship between the RMB and these currencies will remain stable over time, especially in light of the significant political pressure on the Chinese government to permit the free flotation of the RMB, which could result in greater and more frequent fluctuations in the exchange rate between the RMB, the U.S. Dollar, and the Euro. If the RMB were to increase in value against the U.S. Dollar and other currencies, for example, consumers in the U.S., Japan and Europe would experience an increase in the relative prices of goods and services produced by us, which might translate into a decrease in sales. In addition, if the RMB were to decline in value against these other currencies, the financial value of your investment in our shares would also decline.\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively and to pay dividends.\nAll of our sales revenue and expenses are denominated in RMB. Under PRC law, the RMB is currently convertible under the \u201ccurrent account\u201d, which includes dividends and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the \u201ccapital account\u201d, which includes the registered capital and foreign currency loans of a PRC entity. Currently, our PRC operating subsidiaries may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in RMB, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside China that are denominated in foreign currencies.\nForeign exchange transactions by PRC operating subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC government authorities, including SAFE. In particular, if our PRC operating subsidiaries desire to borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance our PRC operating subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, or their respective local counterparts. These limitations could affect our PRC operating subsidiaries\u2019 ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.\nThe PRC government also may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining foreign currency, we may be unable to pay dividends or meet obligations that may be incurred in the future that require payment in foreign currency.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited, because our subsidiaries are incorporated in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we conduct substantially all of our operations in China, and a majority of our officers reside outside the United States.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Florida, we conduct substantially all of our operations in China through our wholly owned subsidiaries in China. The majority of our officers reside outside the United States and some or all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in China in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the PRC may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers.\nAs a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation doing business entirely within the United States.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. Although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties.\nIf we make equity compensation grants to persons who are PRC citizens, they may be required to register with SAFE. We may also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt equity compensation plans for our directors and employees and other parties under PRC laws .\nOn March 28, 2007, SAFE issued the \u201cOperating Procedures for Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan or Stock Option Plan of An Overseas Listed Company, also known as \u201cCircular 78.\u201d It is not clear whether Circular 78 covers all forms of equity compensation plans or only those which provide for the granting of stock options. For any plans which are so covered and are adopted by a non-PRC listed company, such as our company, after March 28, 2007. Circular 78 requires all participants who are PRC citizens to register with and obtain approvals from SAFE prior to their participation in the plan. In addition, Circular 78 also requires PRC citizens to register with SAFE and make the necessary applications and filings if they participated in an overseas listed company\u2019s covered equity compensation plan prior to March 28, 2007. We believe that the registration and approval requirements contemplated in Circular 78 will be burdensome and time consuming.\nWe currently have a 2014 equity incentive plan that was approved by the Compensation Committee on May 30, 2014. We plan to make numerous equity instrument grants under the plan to our officers, directors and employees, some of whom are PRC citizens and may be required to register with SAFE. If it is determined that any of our equity compensation plans are subject to Circular 78, failure to comply with such provisions may subject us and participants in our equity incentive plan who are PRC citizens to fines and legal sanctions and prevent us from being able to grant equity compensation to our PRC employees. In that case, our ability to compensate our employees and directors through equity compensation would be hindered and our business operations may be adversely affected.\nDue to various restrictions under PRC laws on the distribution of dividends by our PRC operating companies, we may not be able to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe Wholly-Foreign Owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended and the Wholly-Foreign Owned Enterprise Law Implementing Rules (1990), as amended and the Company Law of the PRC (2006) contain the principal regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly foreign owned enterprises. Under these regulations, wholly foreign owned enterprises (\u201cWFOE\u201d) may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, WFOE is required to set aside a certain amount of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation and cannot be used for working capital purposes.\nFurthermore, if our consolidated subsidiaries in China incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our consolidated subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations due to these contractual or dividend arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, under current PRC law, we must retain a reserve equal to 10 percent of net income after taxes, not to exceed 50 percent of registered capital. Accordingly, this reserve will not be available to be distributed as dividends to our shareholders. We presently do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Our management intends to follow a policy of retaining all of our earnings to finance the development and execution of our strategy and the expansion of our business.\nWe may be deemed a PRC resident enterprise under the Corporate Income Tax Law and be subject to PRC taxation on our worldwide income.\nThe Corporate Income Tax Law of PRC provides that enterprises established outside of China whose \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d are located within China are considered \u201cresident enterprises\u201d and are generally subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on their worldwide income (including dividend income received from subsidiaries). Under the Implementing Regulations for the Corporate Income Tax Law, \u201cde facto management body\u201d is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and treasury, and acquisition and disposition of properties and other assets of an enterprise. Although substantially all of our operational management is currently based in the PRC, it is unclear whether PRC tax authorities would require (or permit) us to be treated as a PRC-resident enterprise. If we were treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, we will be subject to PRC tax on our worldwide income at the 25% uniform tax rate, which could have an impact on our effective tax rate and an adverse effect on our net income and the results of operations, although dividends distributed from our PRC subsidiaries to us could be exempted from Chinese dividend withholding tax, since such income is exempted under the new Corporate Income Tax Law for PRC-resident recipients.\nDividends payable by us to our foreign investors and profits on the sale of our shares may be subject to tax under PRC tax laws.\nUnder the Implementing Regulations for the Corporate Income Tax Law, PRC income tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are \u201cnon-resident enterprises,\u201d not having an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which do have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent that such dividends have their sources within the PRC. Similarly, any profits realized through the transfer of shares by such investors are also subject to 10% PRC income tax if such profits are regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. If we are considered a PRC \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d it is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to our share, or the profits you may realize from the transfer of our shares, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax. If we are required under the Implementing Regulations for the Corporate Income Tax Law to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC investors that are \u201cnon-resident enterprises,\u201d or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs all of our operations and personnel are in the PRC, we may have difficulty establishing adequate western style management, legal and financial controls.\nThe PRC historically has been deficient in western style management and financial reporting concepts and practices, as well as in modern banking, and other control systems. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet western standards. We may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in the PRC. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other applicable laws, rules and regulations. This may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our business and the public announcement of such deficiencies could adversely impact our stock price.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered on financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud.\nOn December 7, 2018, the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by the U.S. regulators in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. On April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China, reiterating past SEC and PCAOB statements on matters including the difficulty associated with inspecting accounting firms and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets and the difficulty of bringing and enforcing SEC, Department of Justice and other U.S. regulatory actions, including in instances of fraud, in emerging markets generally.\nOn May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in a \u201cRestrictive Market\u201d, (ii) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director for Restrictive Market companies, and (iii) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company\u2019s auditors.\nOn May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the company\u2019s auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer\u2019s securities are prohibited to trade on a national exchange. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\nThe lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors based in China. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms\u2019 audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause existing and potential investors in our stock to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements.\nAs a result of these scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on us, our business and our share price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from developing our growth. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, we and our business operations will be severely affected and you could sustain a significant decline in the value of our common stock.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review by China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any review of our company, our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nOur common stock has limited liquidity.\nOur common stock has been trading on the NYSE MKT (formerly, the American Stock Exchange and NYSE Alternext US LLC) since July 16, 2008 and then transferred to the NASDAQ Global Market on December 31, 2014, but it is thinly traded compared to larger more widely known companies in the same industry. Thinly traded common stock can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market. We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. The high and low bid price of Ever-Glory\u2019s common stock during the past 52-week period ended December 31, 2021 has been US$5.08 and US$1.95 per share respectively.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Our common shares are currently traded, but currently with low volume, based on quotations on the NASDAQ Global Market, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is still relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence trading volume. And even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous trading without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that trading levels will be sustained.\nWe expect to experience volatility in our stock price, which could negatively affect shareholders\u2019 investments.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate based upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, business performance, news announcements or changes in general market conditions.\nOther factors, in addition to the risks included in this section, that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf receipt of substantial orders or order cancellations of products;\n\u25cf the effects of COVID-19;\n\u25cf quality deficiencies in services or products;\n\u25cf international developments, such as technology mandates, political developments or changes in economic policies;\n\u25cf changes in recommendations of securities analysts;\n\u25cf shortfalls in our backlog, sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts or projected by us;\n\u25cf government regulations, including stock option accounting and tax regulations;\n\u25cf energy blackouts;\n\u25cf acts of terrorism and war;\n\u25cf widespread illness;\n\u25cf proprietary rights or product or patent litigation;\n\u25cf strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestitures;\n\u25cf rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices; or\n\u25cf earthquakes or other natural disasters in Nanjing or Shanghai, China where a significant portion of our operations are based.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in the volatility of our common stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nTo date, we have not paid any cash dividends and no cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay any dividends. We presently intend to retain all earnings for our operations.\nOur corporate actions are substantially controlled by our principal shareholders and affiliated entities.\nOur principal shareholders, which include our officers and directors, and their affiliated entities own approximately 73.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock. These shareholders, acting individually or as a group, could exert substantial influence over matters such as electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. In addition, because of the percentage of ownership and voting concentration in these principal shareholders and their affiliated entities, elections of our Board of Directors will generally be within the control of these shareholders and their affiliated entities. While all of our shareholders are entitled to vote on matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, the concentration of shares and voting control presently lies with these principal shareholders and their affiliated entities. As such, it would be difficult for shareholders to propose and have approved proposals not supported by management. There can be no assurances that matters voted upon by our officers and directors in their capacity as shareholders will be viewed favorably by all of our shareholders.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Florida law and the existence of indemnification rights to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur amended and restated Articles of Incorporation contain a provision permitting us to eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and shareholders to the extent provided by Florida law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders.", "PERMNO": 84185, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "EVK"}
