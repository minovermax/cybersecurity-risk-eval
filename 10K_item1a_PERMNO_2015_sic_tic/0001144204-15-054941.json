{"cik": "803647", "company": "VERSAR INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur line of credit contains, and our future debt agreements may contain, covenants that may restrict our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest, including financing future operations or capital needs or engaging in other business activities, and that require us to maintain specific financial ratios or levels.\nOur line of credit restricts, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7 incur additional debt;\n\u00b7 pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock;\n\u00b7 purchase, redeem or retire capital stock;\n\u00b7 make acquisitions and investments;\n\u00b7 create liens on our assets;\n\u00b7 enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7 merge or consolidate with another company; or\n\u00b7 transfer or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business.\nIn addition, our line of credit requires that we comply with certain financial ratios and levels, such as a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum current ratio. It is possible that such covenants may adversely impact our ability to finance our future operations or utilize the capital required to pursue available business opportunities. Additionally, failure to comply with any of these covenants could lead to a default under our line of credit, which could result in an acceleration of indebtedness and prevent us from having access to the line of credit for future borrowings to fund our cash and working capital needs.\nWe are dependent on government contracts for the majority of our revenue, and a reduction or delay in spending by government agencies could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nContracts with agencies of the United States government and various state and local governments represented approximately 97% of our revenue in fiscal year 2015, with 3% of our revenue coming from commercial sources. Therefore, the success of our business is materially dependent on contracts with governmental agencies. Companies engaged in government contracting are subject to certain unique business risks not shared by those serving the general commercial sector. Among these risks are:\n\u00b7 a competitive procurement process with no firm schedule or guarantee of contracts being awarded;\n\u00b7 competitive pricing pressure that may require cost reductions in order to realize revenue under contracts;\n\u00b7 award of work to competitors due primarily to policy reasons;\n\u00b7 dependence on congressional and state appropriations and administrative allotment of funds;\n\u00b7 policies and regulations that can be readily changed by governing bodies;\n\u00b7 competing political priorities and changes in the political climate regarding funding and operations of the services;\n\u00b7 shifts in buying practices and policy changes regarding the use of contractors;\n\u00b7 changes in and delays or cancellations of government programs or requirements;\n\u00b7 government contracts that are usually awarded for relatively short periods of time and are subject to renewal options in favor of the government; and\n\u00b7 many contracts with U.S. government agencies require annual funding and may be terminated in the agency\u2019s sole discretion.\nThe U.S. government contracting laws provide that the U.S. government can do business only with responsible contractors. Accordingly, U.S. government agencies have the authority under certain circumstances to suspend or debar a contractor from bidding on government contracts.\nA reduction or shift in spending priorities by U.S. government agencies could limit or eliminate the continued funding of our existing government contracts or awards of new contracts or new task orders under existing contracts. Any such reductions or shifts in spending, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInability of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government to agree on a budget for key agencies or to enact appropriations in a timely manner has the in past delayed, and may in the future delay, the award of contracts. These delays, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur government contracts are subject to audit and potential reduction of costs and fees.\nContracts with the U.S. government and many other state and local governmental agencies are subject to audit by governmental agencies, which could result in the disallowance of certain costs and expenses. These audits can result in the disallowance of significant costs and expenses if the auditing agency determines, in its discretion, that certain costs and expenses were unwarranted, allowable, or were excessive. Disallowance of costs and expenses, if pervasive or significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations, violation of which could result in sanctions, contract termination, forfeiture of profit, harm to our reputation or loss of our status as an eligible government contractor.\nWe must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the formation, administration and performance of government contracts. These laws and regulations govern how we transact business with our government clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs and related obligations on our business operations. Even though we take significant precautions to prevent and deter fraud, misconduct and non-compliance, we face the risk that our personnel or outside partners may engage in misconduct, fraud or improper activities. Government contract violations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or sanctions, contract termination, forfeiture of profit and/or suspension of payment, any of which could make us lose our status as an eligible government contractor and could cause our reputation to suffer serious harm. Loss of our status as an eligible government contractor would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nActual or perceived conflicts of interest may prevent us from being able to bid on or perform contracts.\nU.S. government agencies have conflict of interest policies that may prevent us from bidding on or performing certain contracts. When dealing with U.S. government agencies that have such policies, we must decide, at times with incomplete information, whether to participate in a particular business opportunity when doing so could preclude us from participating in a related procurement at a future date. We have, on occasion, declined to bid on certain projects because of actual or perceived conflicts of interest. We will continue to encounter such conflicts of interest in the future, which could cause us to be unable to secure key contracts with U.S. government customers.\nRobust enforcement of environmental regulations is important to our financial success.\nOur business is materially dependent on the continued enforcement by local, state and federal governments of various environmental regulations. From time to time, depending on changed enforcement priorities, local, state and federal agencies modify environmental clean-up standards to promote economic growth and to discourage industrial businesses from relocating. Any relaxation in environmental and compliance standards could impact our ability to secure additional contracting work with such agencies or with other federal agencies that operate or manage contaminated property. Further, in a period of relaxed environmental standards, private industry may be less willing to allocate funds to consulting services designed to prevent or remediate environmental problems.\nMany of our U.S. government customers procure goods and services through ID/IQ, government wide acquisition contract (\u201cGWAC\u201d) or GSA Schedule contracts under which we must compete for post-award orders.\nBudgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. government customers to purchase goods and services through ID/IQ, GSA Schedule contracts and other multiple award and/or GWAC contract vehicles. These contract vehicles increase competition and pricing pressures, requiring us to make sustained efforts following the initial contract award to obtain ongoing awards and realize revenue. There can be no assurance that we will increase revenue or otherwise sell successfully under these contract vehicles. Any failure by the Company to compete effectively in this procurement environment could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nIf we fail to recover at-risk contract costs, we may have reduced fees or losses.\nWe are at risk for any costs incurred before a contract is executed, modified or renewed. A customer may choose not to pay us for these costs. While such costs are typically associated with specific anticipated contracts and funding modifications, we cannot be certain that our customers will execute these contracts or contract renewals or that they will pay us for all our related at-risk costs. If unrecovered at-risk costs are significant, we may experience a decline in contract margins or experience losses on certain contracts or in certain periods, resulting in reduced profitability.\nWe could face potential liability for failure to properly design remediation.\nPart of our business involves the design and implementation of remediation at environmental clean-up sites. If we fail to properly design and build a remediation system or if a person claims that we did, we could face expensive litigation and potential settlement costs. If we fail to successfully defend against such a lawsuit, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and our use of hazardous materials may subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as environmental laws and regulations in the various countries in which we operate. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of regulated substances and waste products, such as radioactive, biochemical or other hazardous materials and explosives. We may incur substantial costs in the future because of modifications to current laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, new guidance or new interpretation of existing laws or regulations, violations of environmental laws or required operating permits, or discovery of previously unknown contamination. Incurring such additional costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to properly manage projects may result in additional costs or claims.\nOur engagements regularly involve complex and lengthy projects. The quality of our performance on such projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage the relationship with our clients, and to effectively manage the projects and deploy appropriate resources in a timely manner. If we miscalculate the resources or time required to complete those projects with capped or fixed fees, our operating results could be adversely affected. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our client\u2019s expectations, could result in claims for damages against us.\nOur services expose us to significant risks of liability and it may be difficult to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage.\nOur services involve significant risks of professional and other liabilities that may exceed the fees we derive from performance. Our business activities could expose us to potential liability under various laws and regulations and under federal and state workplace health and safety regulations. In addition, we sometimes may assume liability by contract under indemnification agreements. Given the varied nature of our many agreements, we are not able to predict the magnitude of any such liabilities.\nWe obtain insurance from third party carriers to cover our potential risks and liabilities. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to meet our needs, may have to pay an excessive amount for the insurance coverage we want, or may not be able to acquire any insurance for certain types of business risks.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted internationally. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u00b7 export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;\n\u00b7 compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7 compliance with the U.K Bribery Act;\n\u00b7 compliance with the anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u00b7 the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations;\n\u00b7 contract award and funding delays;\n\u00b7 potential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u00b7 foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7 import and export duties and value added taxes;\n\u00b7 transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u00b7 uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and\n\u00b7 potential military conflicts, civil strife and political risks.\nWhile we have and will continue to adopt and implement measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our foreign business, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate.\nPolitical destabilization or insurgency in the regions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain regions in which we operate are highly politically unstable. Insurgent activities in the areas in which we operate may cause further destabilization in these regions. There can be no assurance that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. We are required to increase compensation to our personnel as an incentive to deploy them to many of these regions. To date, we have been able to recover such costs under our contracts, but we may not be able to do so in the future. To the extent that we are unable to transfer such increased costs to our customers, our operating margins would be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our operating performance. In addition, increased insurgent activities or destabilization, including civil unrest or a civil war in Iraq or Afghanistan, may lead to a determination by the U.S. government to halt our operations in a particular location, country or region and to perform the services we provide using military personnel.\nIf our partners fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project, we could be exposed to legal liability, loss of reputation or reduced profits.\nFrom time to time, we enter joint venture agreements and other contractual arrangements with partners to jointly bid on and execute certain projects. The success of these joint projects depends in part on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations by our partners. If any of our partners fail to satisfy their contractual obligations, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to complete projects, increasing our cost on such projects. If we are unable to adequately address a partner\u2019s performance issues, then our client could terminate the joint project, exposing us to legal liability, loss of reputation or reduced profits.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries.\nThe markets for many of our services are highly competitive. There are numerous professional architectural, engineering, construction management, and environmental consulting firms, and other organizations that offer many of the same services offered by us. We compete with many companies that have greater resources than us and we cannot provide assurance that such competitors will not substantially increase the resources they devote to those businesses that compete directly with our services. Competitive factors considered by clients include reputation, performance, price, geographic location and availability of technically skilled personnel. In addition, we face competition from the use by our clients of in-house environmental, engineering and other staff.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions of other businesses, which may require us to incur costs and liabilities or have other unexpected consequences which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to internal or organic growth, our current strategy involves growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses, as well as growth from acquisitions that would diversify our current service offerings. Like other companies with similar growth strategies, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, as we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain acceptable financing, or consummate any future acquisitions. We frequently engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and negotiations for possible acquisitions, certain of which, if consummated, could significantly enhance the Company\u2019s competitive position. Although it is our general objective only to acquire those companies which will be accretive to both earnings and cash flow, any potential acquisitions may result in material transaction expenses, increased interest and amortization expense, increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Acquisitions will require integration and management of the acquired businesses to realize economies of scale and control costs. In addition, acquisitions may involve other risks, including diversion of management resources otherwise available for ongoing development of our business and risks associated with entering new markets. Future acquisitions may also result in potential dilution of the Company\u2019s securities. Consummation of acquisitions may subject the Company to unanticipated business uncertainties or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not fully indemnify us. We may not realize the full anticipated benefit of any acquired business that has operated as a small business (as determined by the Small Business Administration based upon the North American Industry Classification Systems) if following their acquisition by us certain of their contracts are revoked or not renewed because they fail to continue to maintain small business status.\nAn economic downturn may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn an economic recession, or under other adverse macroeconomic conditions that may arise from natural or man-made events, customers and vendors may be less likely to meet contractual terms and payment or delivery obligations. In particular, if the U.S. government changes its operational priorities in Iraq and/or Afghanistan, reduces the DoD Operations and Maintenance budget, or reduces funding for Department of State initiatives in which we participate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be severely affected.\nOur quarterly and annual revenue, expenses and operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues, expenses and operating results have and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the seasonality of the spending cycle of our public sector clients, notably the U.S. government, and the spending patterns of our private sector clients;\n\u2022 the hiring and utilization rates of employees in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022 the number and significance of client engagements commenced and completed during the period;\n\u2022 the delays incurred in connection with an engagement because of weather or other factors;\n\u2022 the ability to work within foreign countries\u2019 regulations, tax requirements and obligations;\n\u2022 the business, financial, and security risks related to working in foreign countries;\n\u2022 the ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalties;\n\u2022 the creditworthiness and solvency of clients;\n\u2022 the size and scope of engagements;\n\u2022 the delay in federal, state and local government procurements;\n\u2022 the ability to perform contracts within budget or contractual limitations;\n\u2022 the timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives;\n\u2022 any threatened or pending litigation matters;\n\u2022 periodic reductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors;\n\u2022 the likelihood of winning the re-bids of our existing large government contracts;\n\u2022 the general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022 the loss of a major contract or the shutdown of a major program;\n\u2022 the volatility of currencies in foreign countries; and\n\u2022 our ability to integrate any acquisition or the ability of an acquired business to continue to perform as expected.\nVariations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in net losses and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe are highly dependent on key personnel and our business could suffer if we fail to continue to attract, train and retain skilled employees.\nOur business is managed by a number of key management and operating professional personnel. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAvailability of highly trained and skilled professional, administrative and technical personnel is critical to our future growth and profitability. Even in the current economic climate, competition in our industry for scientists, engineers, technicians, management and professional personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees. Competition for experienced personnel, particularly in highly specialized areas, has occasionally made it more difficult for us to timely meet all our staffing needs. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract and retain required staff. Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to meet our financial obligations. Failure to recruit and retain a sufficient number of such employees could adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow our business. Some of our contracts require us to staff a program with personnel that the customer considers key to successful performance. If we cannot provide such personnel or acceptable substitutes, the customer may terminate the contract, and we may be unable to recover our costs.\nIn order to succeed, we will have to keep up with a variety of rapidly changing technologies. Various factors could affect our ability to keep pace with these changes.\nOur success will depend on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies that can occur rapidly in our core business segments. We may incur significant expenses updating our technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations. Even if we keep up with the latest developments and available technology, newer services or technologies could negatively affect our business.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm our business.\nLike all companies, we face the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Employee misconduct could include intentional failures to comply with U.S. government procurement regulations, unauthorized activities, attempts to obtain reimbursement for improper expenses, or submission of falsified time records. Employee misconduct could also involve improper use of our customers\u2019 sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us. Negative press reports regarding employee misconduct could harm our reputation with the government agencies with which we work. If our reputation with these agencies is negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nInternal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenue, profitability and operating results.\nOur information technology systems are subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Any such failures could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. Failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any system or service disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to bill our customers for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Versar is investing in systems that will allow it to achieve and remain in compliance with the regulations governing its business; however, there can be no assurance that such systems will be effective at achieving and maintaining compliance or that we will not incur additional costs in order to make such systems effective.", "PERMNO": 71191, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "VSRI"}
