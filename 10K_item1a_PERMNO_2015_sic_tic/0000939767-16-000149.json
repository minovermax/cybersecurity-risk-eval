The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occurs, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Need for Additional Financing and Our Financial Results\nIf additional capital is not available to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts and we may breach our financial covenants.\nWe may need to access additional capital to:\n\u2022\nfund our operations and clinical trials;\n\u2022\ncontinue our research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nexpand our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\ncommercialize cabozantinib or any other future product candidates, if any such candidates receive regulatory approval for commercial sale; and\n\u2022\nfund the portion of U.S. sales and marketing costs for cobimetinib that we are obligated to fund under our collaboration with Genentech, or any similar costs we are obligated to fund under collaborations we may enter into in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $253.3 million in cash and investments, which included $169.0 million available for operations, $81.6 million of compensating balance investments that we are required to maintain on deposit with Silicon Valley Bank, and $2.7 million of long-term restricted investments. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments available for operations, and product revenues, will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least 12 months following the filing date of this report. However, our future capital requirements will be substantial, and we may need to raise additional capital in the future. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, and we may need to use available capital resources and raise additional capital significantly earlier than we currently anticipate. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from that approved product;\n\u2022\nthe pace and progress of our current increase in sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution capabilities in anticipation of obtaining FDA approval for cabozantinib for the potential treatment of advanced RCC patients;\n\u2022\nthe successful establishment of the distribution and commercialization network for COMETRIQ in the approved MTC indication and cabozantinib for the potential treatment of advanced RCC patients, as well as the achievement of stated regulatory and commercial milestones, under our collaboration with Ipsen;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of COTELLIC and the calculation of our share of related profits and losses for the commercialization of COTELLIC in the U.S. and royalties from COTELLIC sales outside the U.S. under our collaboration with Genentech;\n\u2022\nthe speed of a potential regulatory approval for cabozantinib for the treatment of advanced RCC and other indications;\n\u2022\nfuture clinical trial results, notably the results from CELESTIAL, our phase 3 pivotal trial in patients with advanced HCC;\n\u2022\nrepayment of the Deerfield Notes (see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Factors Important to Understanding Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Deerfield Facility\u201d for a description of these notes) which mature on July 1, 2018, subject to a requirement to make a mandatory prepayment in each of 2017 and 2018 equal to 15% of certain revenues from collaborative arrangements (other than intercompany arrangements) received during the prior fiscal year, subject to a maximum annual prepayment amount of $27.5 million;\n\u2022\nour ability to repay the Deerfield Notes with our common stock, which we are only able to do under specified conditions;\n\u2022\nrepayment of our $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019, or the 2019 Notes, (see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Factors Important to Understanding Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d for a description of these notes), which mature on August 15, 2019, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased;\n\u2022\nrepayment of our term loan from Silicon Valley Bank, which had an outstanding balance at December 31, 2015, of $80.0 million;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs;\n\u2022\nour ability to remain in compliance with, or amend or cause to be waived, financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical drug supply for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntrends and developments in the pricing of oncologic therapeutics in the United States and abroad, especially in the EU;\n\u2022\nscientific developments in the market for oncologic therapeutics and the timing of regulatory approvals for competing oncologic therapies; and\n\u2022\nthe filing, maintenance, prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nWe have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since inception through December 31, 2015, with the exception of the 2011 fiscal year. We anticipate net losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $169.7 million and as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.9 billion. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 deficit and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether or when we will become profitable, if at all. Excluding fiscal 2011, our research and development expenditures and selling, general and administrative expenses have exceeded our revenues for each fiscal year, and we expect to spend significant additional amounts to fund the continued development and commercialization of cabozantinib. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial operating expenses and, consequently, we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve future profitability.\nWe commercially launched COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC in the United States in late January 2013, and from the commercial launch through December 31, 2015, we have generated $74.3 million in net revenues from the sale of COMETRIQ. Other than revenues from COMETRIQ, we have derived substantially all of our revenues since inception from collaborative research and development agreements, which depend on research funding, the achievement of milestones, and royalties we earn from any future products developed from the collaborative research.\nThe amount of our net losses will depend, in part, on: the rate of growth, if any, in our sales of COMETRIQ; the level of sales of cabozantinib in the United States for the treatment of advanced RCC, if approved by the FDA for such indication; receipt of the upfront payment, achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and the amount of royalties from sales of cabozantinib for the treatment of advanced RCC in the European Union and elsewhere, if approved for such indication under our collaboration with Ipsen; our share of the net profits and losses for the commercialization of COTELLIC in the U.S.; the amount of royalties from COTELLIC sales outside the U.S.; other license and contract revenues; and, the level of expenses primarily with respect to expanded commercialization activities for cabozantinib.\nOur significant level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant indebtedness and substantial debt service requirements as a result of the Deerfield Notes, our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and the 2019 Notes. As of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated indebtedness through maturity was $492.5 million (excluding trade payables). We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. If we incur additional indebtedness, it would increase our interest expense, leverage and operating and financial costs.\nOur indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under the 2019 Notes, the Deerfield Notes, our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank or our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including clinical trials, research and development, capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\npreventing us from raising funds necessary to purchase the 2019 Notes in the event we are required to do so following a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d as specified in the indenture governing the 2019 Notes, or to settle conversions of the 2019 Notes in cash;\n\u2022\ndilution experienced by our existing stockholders as a result of the conversion of the 2019 Notes or the Deerfield Notes into shares of common stock; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain sufficient cash reserves or that our business will generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or that our cash needs will not increase. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of the 2019 Notes, the Deerfield Notes, our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, or any indebtedness which we have incurred or may incur in the future, we would be in default, which would permit the holders or the Trustee of the 2019 Notes or other indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such notes or other indebtedness and could cause defaults under the 2019 Notes, the Deerfield Notes, our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank or our other indebtedness. Any default under the 2019 Notes, the Deerfield Notes, our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, or any indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf a Fundamental Change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2019 Notes, occurs, holders of the 2019 Notes may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their 2019 Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change purchase date. We may not have sufficient funds to purchase the notes upon a Fundamental Change. In addition, the terms of any borrowing agreements that we may enter into from time to time may require early repayment of borrowings under circumstances similar to those constituting a Fundamental Change. Furthermore, any repurchase of 2019 Notes by us may be considered an event of default under such borrowing agreements.\nWe are exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nMost of our foreign expenses incurred are associated with establishing and conducting clinical trials for cabozantinib. The amount of these expenses will be impacted by fluctuations in the currencies of those countries in which we conduct clinical trials. Our agreements with the foreign sites that conduct such clinical trials generally provide that payments for the services provided will be calculated in the currency of that country, and converted into U.S. dollars using various exchange rates based upon when services are rendered or the timing of invoices. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar value of the foreign-currency denominated expense increases, and when the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of the foreign-currency denominated expense decreases. Consequently, changes in exchange rates may affect our financial position and results of operations.\nGlobal credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase. While as of the date of this report we are not aware of any downgrades, material losses, or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments since December 31, 2015, no assurance can be given that a deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives.\nRisks Related to Cabozantinib and Cobimetinib\nIn the short-term, our prospects are critically dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for cabozantinib in advanced RCC and then undertake a successful commercial launch of the product in the United States and European Union.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon the successful development and commercialization of cabozantinib. Of greatest short-term importance is the commercialization of cabozantinib for advanced RCC. On July 20, 2015, we announced that METEOR, a phase 3 pivotal trial comparing cabozantinib to everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who have experienced disease progression following treatment with at least one prior VEGFR TKI, met its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in PFS for cabozantinib versus everolimus in the first 375 randomized patients as determined by an IRC. The trial also showed a positive trend for the secondary endpoint of OS, although at the time of the July 2015 interim analysis the p-value to achieve statistical significance was not reached. On February 1, 2016, we announced that in a second interim analysis of the entire study population of 658 patients, the results showed a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful increase in OS for patients randomized to cabozantinib as compared to everolimus. In August 2015 the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to cabozantinib as a potential treatment for RCC. Although we completed our regulatory filings in the United States for treatment of advanced RCC and the FDA has granted priority review for our filing and set a PDUFA action date of June 22, 2016, we cannot be certain that the FDA will ultimately approve cabozantinib for the treatment of previously treated patients with advanced RCC. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining FDA approval for cabozantinib for advanced RCC, we will not have the resources necessary to continue our business in its current form.\nIn addition, even if such approval is obtained, the commercial potential of cabozantinib for the treatment of advanced RCC remains subject to a variety of factors, including the perceived benefit/risk profile associated with cabozantinib as compared to everolimus, and the availability and benefit/risk profiles of competitive treatments. If cabozantinib is approved for the treatment of 2nd or later-line advanced RCC, its potential principal competition in this indication includes nivolumab, axitinib and everolimus, which are already approved in this indication, as well as other agents currently approved for 1st-line RCC including sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, temsirolimus, and bevacizumab. Other agents being investigated in 2nd line advanced RCC, including Eisai\u2019s lenvatinib, may also become competitive treatments if they are approved.\nWith respect to regulatory and commercialization activities for cabozantinib in the European Union and elsewhere internationally, in January 2016, our MAA for cabozantinib as a treatment for patients with advanced RCC who have received one prior therapy was accepted for review and granted accelerated assessment by the EMA. In February 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Ipsen to enable us to capitalize on the potential opportunity of cabozantinib in advanced RCC and potentially other indications, if approved by the EMA and elsewhere internationally outside of the U.S., Canada, and Japan. As a result, we now rely heavily upon Ipsen\u2019s regulatory, commercial, medical affairs, and other expertise and resources. If Ipsen is unable to, or does not invest the resources necessary to, obtain regulatory approvals for cabozantinib in the European Union and elsewhere; and then, if Ipsen is not able to, or does not invest the resources necessary to, successfully commercialize cabozantinib in those international territories where it is approved, this will minimize our potential revenue under the collaboration agreement, thus resulting in harm to our business and operations.\nOur longer-term prospects remain dependent on cabozantinib\u2019s further clinical development and commercial success in additional indications beyond advanced RCC.\nWe are dedicating substantially all of our proprietary resources to developing cabozantinib into a broad and significant oncology franchise. Even assuming cabozantinib\u2019s approval in the United States and European Union for the treatment of advanced RCC, our longer-term success remains contingent upon, among other things, successful clinical development, regulatory approval and market acceptance of cabozantinib in additional indications, such as advanced HCC, first-line RCC, NSCLC, and other forms of cancer. In 2014, the failure of COMET-1 and COMET-2, our two phase 3 pivotal trials of cabozantinib in mCRPC, to meet their respective primary endpoints negatively impacted our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals for cabozantinib in prostate cancer. These failures demonstrate that cabozantinib will not likely be successful in all future clinical trials. Should we prove unsuccessful in the further development of cabozantinib beyond MTC or advanced RCC, our longer-term prospects, revenues and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. With top-line results from CELESTIAL, our phase 3 pivotal trial comparing cabozantinib to placebo in patients with advanced HCC, expected in 2017, the successful development of cabozantinib in advanced HCC is of increasing importance to our long-term success.\nWe are dependent on the successful commercialization and development of cobimetinib, and rely heavily on our partner, Genentech, for achieving that success.\nUnder the terms of our collaboration agreement with Genentech for the development and commercialization of cobimetinib, we depend upon Genentech\u2019s strategic and tactical planning, decision-making, and execution with regard to the worldwide commercialization of cobimetinib. The collaboration agreement provides that we are entitled to an initial equal share of U.S. profits and losses for cobimetinib, with our share decreasing as sales increase. However, Genentech, and its parent, the Roche group, may not fund or otherwise resource and prioritize the commercialization of cobimetinib for the indication currently approved in the U.S., Switzerland, the European Union and Canada sufficient to achieve the product\u2019s full commercial potential. Furthermore, expense allocations for COTELLIC, as determined by Genentech, and its parent, the Roche group, may exceed our estimated accruals. If we are unable to agree upon the level and type of expenses that have been allocated to COTELLIC under the collaboration, we may be forced to initiate a dispute in accordance with the terms of the collaboration. And, regardless of the level of Genentech\u2019s investment in cobimetinib, the compound may not be accepted by physicians, patients, health care payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the medical community.\nWe similarly rely heavily upon Genentech\u2019s leadership and expertise to develop cobimetinib further. Any significant changes to Genentech\u2019s business strategy and priorities, over which we have no control, could adversely affect Genentech\u2019s willingness or ability to complete their obligations under our agreement and result in harm to our business and operations. Genentech has complete financial responsibility for cobimetinib\u2019s development program and regulatory strategy, and we are not able to control the amount or timing of resources that Genentech will devote to the product. Of particular significance are Genentech\u2019s development efforts with respect to the combination of cobimetinib with immuno-oncology agents, a promising and competitive area of clinical research. While Genentech is currently conducting a phase 1b clinical trial combining cobimetinib with the Genentech PD-L1 antibody (MPDL3280A), we are dependent on Genentech for all future development of cobimetinib in combination with MPDL3280A or any other immuno-oncology agents. Regardless of Genentech\u2019s efforts toward the further development of cobimetinib, such additional clinical investigation may not provide positive results supporting product label expansions or approval in additional indications.\nThe commercial success of cabozantinib, as COMETRIQ capsules for MTC or if approved in a tablet formulation for additional indications in the future, will depend upon the degree of market acceptance for cabozantinib among physicians, patients, health care payers, and the medical community.\nOur ability to commercialize cabozantinib, as COMETRIQ capsules for the approved MTC indication or if approved in a tablet formulation for advanced RCC or additional indications, will be highly dependent upon the extent to which cabozantinib gains market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the medical community. If cabozantinib does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant future product revenues, and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of COMETRIQ and other cabozantinib products, if approved, will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness, of cabozantinib in comparison to competing products;\n\u2022\nthe existence of any significant side effects of cabozantinib, as well as their severity in comparison to those of any competing products;\n\u2022\ncabozantinib\u2019s potential advantages or disadvantages in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market entry relative to competitive treatments;\n\u2022\nindications for which cabozantinib is approved;\n\u2022\nthe ability to offer cabozantinib for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe strength of sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution support; and\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party coverage and reimbursement.\nIf we are unable to maintain or scale adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to commercialize cabozantinib successfully.\nWe have designed our commercial organization and strategic commercial approach to maintain flexibility in response to market opportunities. We are currently increasing our sales, marketing, medical affairs, and distribution capabilities in anticipation of obtaining FDA approval for cabozantinib for the treatment for patients with RCC who have received one prior therapy. We expect to be able to scale up our commercialization capabilities quickly if additional indications for cabozantinib are approved in the future, or to scale down, if necessary. Our ex-US distribution arrangements with Sobi are also right-sized for the European Union MTC opportunity and retain strategic flexibility. Overall, we believe the design of our commercial\norganization, and our strategic commercial approach, are efficient, taking advantage of outsourcing options where prudent to maximize the effectiveness of our commercial expenditures.\nHowever, we believe the commercial opportunity for cabozantinib will grow over time, but we may not properly judge the requisite size, and experience of the commercialization team or the scale of distribution necessary to market and sell cabozantinib successfully. Maintaining sales, marketing, medical affairs, and distribution capabilities is expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of cabozantinib and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. If we are unable to maintain adequate sales, marketing, medical affairs, and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, we may not be able to generate product revenues and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe currently rely on a single third party logistics provider to handle shipping and warehousing of our commercial supply of COMETRIQ and a single specialty pharmacy to dispense COMETRIQ to patients in fulfillment of prescriptions in the United States. Should cabozantinib be approved by the FDA for advanced RCC, we intend to expand our U.S. distribution and pharmacy channels appropriately. Outside the U.S., we currently rely on a third party, Sobi, to distribute and commercialize COMETRIQ for the MTC indication primarily in the European Union, but also in other countries through the NPU program.\nThe terms of our commercialization agreement with Sobi provide us with the ability to terminate the agreement at will upon payment of certain pre-determined termination fees. In connection with the establishment of our collaboration with Ipsen, we intend to provide Sobi with notice of termination and following a transition period, Ipsen will become responsible for the continued distribution and commercialization of COMETRIQ for the approved MTC indication in territories currently supported by Sobi and potentially other countries in the event that COMETRIQ is approved for commercial sale in such territories, as well as access and distribution activities for COMETRIQ under our NPU program.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon the activities, and legal and regulatory compliance, of these or other third parties may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to supply cabozantinib to the marketplace on a timely and competitive basis. For example, if our third party logistics provider\u2019s warehouse suffers a fire or damage from another type of disaster, the commercial supply of COMETRIQ could be destroyed, resulting in a disruption in our commercialization efforts. These or other third parties may not be able to provide services in the time we require to meet our commercial timelines and objectives or to meet regulatory requirements. We may not be able to maintain or renew our arrangements with third parties, or enter into new arrangements, on acceptable terms, or at all. Third parties could terminate or decline to renew our arrangements based on their own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. If we are unable to contract for logistics services or distribution of cabozantinib on acceptable terms, our commercialization efforts may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe are subject to certain healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain healthcare laws and regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Law, which constrains our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws\ngoverning the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, certain medical professionals);\n\u2022\nfederal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022\nstate and federal government price reporting laws that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported priced may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our marketed drugs (participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts); and\n\u2022\nstate and federal marketing expenditure tracking and reporting laws, which generally require certain types of expenditures in the United States to be tracked and reported (compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships, which could potentially have a negative effect on our business and/or increase enforcement scrutiny of our activities).\nIn addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate certain federal and state health regulatory fraud and abuse laws as well as false claims laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, or our officers or employees, may be subject to penalties, including administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products or operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results.\nNumerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive (95/46/EC) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within Europe and between European countries and the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.\nIf we are unable to obtain both adequate coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers for cabozantinib, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize cabozantinib will be highly dependent on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for it is, and will be, available from third-party payers, including governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers. Many patients will not be capable of paying for cabozantinib themselves and will rely on third-party payers to pay for, or subsidize, their medical needs. If third-party payers do not provide coverage or reimbursement for cabozantinib, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer. In addition, even if third-party payers provide some coverage or reimbursement for cabozantinib, the availability of such coverage or reimbursement for prescription drugs under private health insurance and managed care plans often varies based on the type of contract or plan purchased. There has been recent negative publicity regarding the use of specialty pharmacies and drug pricing, which may result in physicians being less willing to participate in our patient access programs and thereby limit our ability to increase patient access and adoption of cabozantinib.\nIn addition, in some foreign countries, particularly the countries in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, price negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product, which has the potential to substantially delay broad availability of the product in some of those countries. To obtain reimbursement and/or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of cabozantinib\nto other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in the commercialization of cabozantinib. Third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payers limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. In particular, third-party payers may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use cabozantinib. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for cabozantinib, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nCurrent healthcare laws and regulations and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell cabozantinib profitably.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell cabozantinib profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nWe expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product. An expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may cause general downward pressure on the prices of prescription drug products, lower reimbursements for providers using our products, reduce product utilization and adversely affect our business and results of operations. It is unclear whether and to what extent, if at all, other potential developments resulting from the PPACA may provide us with additional revenue to offset the annual excise tax (on certain drug product sales) enacted under the PPACA, subject to limited exceptions. It is possible that the tax burden, if ours is not excepted, would adversely affect our financial performance. The PPACA, among other things, also established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Moreover, certain politicians, including presidential candidates, have announced plans to regulate the prices of pharmaceutical products. We cannot know what form any such legislation may take or the market\u2019s perception of how such legislation would affect us. Any reduction in reimbursement from government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our current products and/or those for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.\nAs a result of the overall trend towards cost-effectiveness criteria and managed healthcare in the United States, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may use tiered reimbursement and may adversely affect demand for cabozantinib by placing it in an expensive tier. They may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payers will reimburse for newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. Further, we do not have experience in ensuring approval by applicable third-party payers outside of the United States for coverage and reimbursement of cabozantinib. We also anticipate pricing pressures in connection with the sale of cabozantinib due to the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.\nOur competitors may develop products and technologies that impair the value of cabozantinib and cobimetinib.\nThe pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly fragmented and are characterized by rapid technological change. In particular, the area of kinase-targeted therapies is a rapidly evolving and competitive field. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Some of our competitors have entered into collaborations with leading companies within our target markets, including some of our existing collaborators. Some of our competitors are further along in the development of their products than we are. In addition, delays in the further development of cabozantinib or cobimetinib for the treatment of additional tumor types, could allow our competitors to bring products to market before us. Our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances. The markets for which we intend to pursue regulatory approval of cabozantinib and for which Roche and Genentech intend to pursue regulatory approval for cobimetinib are highly competitive. Further, our competitors may be more effective at using their technologies to develop commercial products. Many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, more experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that would render our technologies and products, and those of our collaborators, obsolete and noncompetitive. There\nmay also be drug candidates of which we are not aware at an earlier stage of development that may compete with cabozantinib and cobimetinib. In addition, cabozantinib and cobimetinib may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of use, such as chemotherapy and radiation treatments in cancer indications.\nCompetition for cabozantinib\nWe believe that the principal competing anti-cancer therapy to COMETRIQ in progressive, metastatic MTC is AstraZeneca\u2019s RET, VEGFR and EGFR inhibitor vandetanib, which has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of symptomatic or progressive MTC in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease. On October 21, 2015, AstraZeneca announced the global completion of the sale of vandetanib to Genzyme, a Sanofi company. We anticipate the potential for increased competition for COMETRIQ in progressive, metastatic MTC as a result of the consolidation of vandetanib into Genzyme\u2019s endocrinology portfolio and the company\u2019s rare disease expertise. In addition, we believe that COMETRIQ also faces competition as a treatment for progressive, metastatic MTC from off-label use of Bayer\u2019s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals\u2019 (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen) multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, Pfizer\u2019s multikinase inhibitor sunitinib, Ariad Pharmaceutical\u2019s multikinase inhibitor ponatinib, Novartis\u2019 multikinase inhibitor pazopanib, and Eisai\u2019s multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib.\nShould cabozantinib be approved for the treatment of advanced RCC as a result of positive results from the METEOR trial, we believe its principal competition may include: Pfizer\u2019s axitinib, sunitinib and temsirolimus; Novartis\u2019 everolimus and pazopanib; Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s nivolumab, Bayer\u2019s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals\u2019 sorafenib; Genentech\u2019s bevacizumab; and, Eisai\u2019s lenvatinib.\nThe potential for immediate competition from Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s nivolumab is particularly significant. Nivolumab was approved for the treatment of advanced RCC on November 23, 2015, following a rapid review by the FDA. That approval was based in large part on the results of Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s phase 3 trial comparing nivolumab to everolimus in patients who had received previous antiangiogenic therapy for advanced RCC (Checkmate 025), in which nivolumab met its primary endpoint of showing a statistically-significant improvement in OS over everolimus, a current standard of care for the treatment of second line RCC patients. Nivolumab failed to demonstrate a statistically-significant PFS benefit over everolimus. Nivolumab also demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. We anticipate that nivolumab may be rapidly adopted by physicians for the treatment of advanced RCC.\nShould cabozantinib be approved for the treatment of HCC, the other indication for which we have an ongoing phase 3 pivotal trial, we believe its principal competition may include Bayer\u2019s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals\u2019 sorafenib; Bayer\u2019s regorafenib; ArQule\u2019s tivantinib; and Eisai\u2019s lenvatinib.\nExamples of potential competition for cabozantinib in other cancer indications include: other VEGF pathway inhibitors, including Genentech\u2019s bevacizumab; other RET inhibitors including Eisai\u2019s lenvatinib and Ariad\u2019s ponatinib; and other MET inhibitors, including Amgen\u2019s AMG 208, Pfizer\u2019s crizotinib, ArQule\u2019s tivantinib, and Mirati\u2019s MGCD265; and immunotherapies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s ipilimumab and nivolimab and Merck\u2019s pembrolizumab.\nCompetition for cobimetinib\nWe believe that cobimetinib\u2019s principal competition amongst targeted agents includes Novartis\u2019 trametinib and dabrafenib, and Array\u2019s encorafenib and binimetinib; and within the class of immunotherapies, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s ipilimumab and nivolumab and Merck\u2019s pembrolizumab. The second category, immunotherapies, are of particular competitive importance vis-a-vis cobimetinib in advanced melanoma as they are already FDA approved in melanoma patient populations that overlap with those that may be eligible for cobimetinib, they have been rapidly incorporated into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines, and they are viewed with a high degree of enthusiasm by physicians and key opinion leaders. Ongoing and future trials incorporating immune-oncology agents, including combination trials, may further impact usage of cobimetinib in melanoma and potentially in additional tumor types in which cobimetinib may ultimately gain approval.\nWe lack the manufacturing capabilities and experience necessary to enable us to produce cabozantinib for clinical development or for commercial sale and rely on third parties to do so, which subjects us to various risks.\nWe do not have the manufacturing capabilities or expertise necessary to enable us to produce materials for our clinical trials or for commercial sale of cabozantinib in either its capsule formulation or tablet formulation, and rely on third party contractors to do so. These third parties must comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP and the European Commission\u2019s Guidelines on Good Distribution Practice. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon these third parties may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop and commercialize cabozantinib on a timely and competitive basis. These third parties may not be able to produce\nmaterial on a timely basis or manufacture material at the quality or in the quantity required to meet our development and commercial timelines and applicable regulatory requirements. We may not be able to maintain or renew our existing third party manufacturing and supply arrangements, or enter into new arrangements, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our third party manufacturers and suppliers could terminate or decline to renew our manufacturing and supply arrangements based on their own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. If we are unable to contract for the production of materials in sufficient quantity and of sufficient quality on acceptable terms, our clinical trials and commercialization efforts may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. This risk is especially acute during the current period as we ramp up production plans in anticipation of a potential commercial launch in advanced RCC.\nThe manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and our third party vendors are subject to cGMP. Our third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with the cGMP regulations, other applicable FDA regulatory requirements or similar regulations applicable outside of the United States. Additionally, if we are required to enter into new manufacturing or supply arrangements, we may not be able to obtain approval from the FDA of any alternate manufacturer or supplier in a timely manner, or at all, which could delay or prevent the clinical development and commercialization of cabozantinib. Failure of our third party manufacturers or suppliers or us to obtain approval from the FDA or to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, civil penalties, delays in or failure to grant marketing approval of cabozantinib, injunctions, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products and compounds, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. Our third party manufacturers are subject to routine regulatory inspections. Failure of our third party manufacturers to meet these appropriate standards and/or perform manufacturing as required could result in a batch not passing quality inspection or meeting regulatory approval. This could result in product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could have also a significant adverse effect on our business.\nClinical testing of cabozantinib is a lengthy, costly, complex and uncertain process and may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nCabozantinib is being evaluated in a comprehensive development program for the treatment of advanced HCC and a variety of other indications beyond the approved MTC indication and the pending advanced RCC indication. Clinical trials are inherently risky and may reveal that cabozantinib is ineffective or has unacceptable toxicity or other side effects that may significantly decrease the likelihood of regulatory approval in such indications. For example, COMET-1 and COMET-2, our two phase 3 pivotal trials of cabozantinib in mCRPC, failed to meet their respective primary endpoints of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in OS for patients treated with cabozantinib as compared to prednisone and to demonstrate improvement in pain response for patients treated by cabozantinib as compared to mitoxantrone/prednisone. Based on the outcome of the COMET trials, we deprioritized the clinical development of cabozantinib in mCRPC.\nThe results of preliminary studies do not necessarily predict clinical or commercial success, and later-stage clinical trials may fail to confirm the results observed in earlier-stage trials or preliminary studies. Although we have established timelines for manufacturing and clinical development of cabozantinib based on existing knowledge of our compounds in development and industry metrics, we may not be able to meet those timelines.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events, during or as a result of clinical testing, that could delay or prevent commercialization of cabozantinib for the treatment of advanced HCC, and other indications, including:\n\u2022\ncabozantinib may not prove to be efficacious or may cause, or potentially cause, harmful side effects;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive clinical trial results may require us to conduct further testing or to abandon projects that we had expected to be promising;\n\u2022\nour competitors may discover or commercialize other compounds or therapies that show significantly improved safety or efficacy compared to cabozantinib;\n\u2022\npatient registration or enrollment in our clinical testing may be lower than we anticipate, resulting in the delay or cancellation of clinical testing; and\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may withhold authorization of cabozantinib, or delay, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their determination that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nIf we were to have significant delays in or termination of our clinical testing of cabozantinib as a result of any of the events described above or otherwise, our expenses could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be impaired, either of which could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and may not be able to rapidly or effectively continue the further development of cabozantinib or meet current or future requirements of the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including those identified based on our discussions with the FDA or such other regulatory authorities. Our\nplanned clinical trials may not begin on time, or at all, may not be completed on schedule, or at all, may not be sufficient for registration of cabozantinib or may not result in an approvable product.\nCompletion of clinical trials may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of cabozantinib. The duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of factors relating to the clinical trial, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe number of patients who ultimately participate in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe duration of patient follow-up that is appropriate in view of the results or required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical sites included in the trials; and\n\u2022\nthe length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects.\nAny delay could limit our ability to generate revenues, cause us to incur additional expense and cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Our partners under our collaboration agreements may experience similar risks with respect to the compounds we have out-licensed to them. If any of the events described above were to occur with such programs or compounds, the likelihood of receipt of milestones and royalties under such collaboration agreements could decrease.\nIf third parties upon which we rely do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib for the treatment of additional indications beyond the approved MTC indication.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for cabozantinib, including our post-marketing commitments in connection with the approvals of COMETRIQ in MTC, and we rely on third parties we do not control such as the federal government (including NCI-CTEP, with whom we have our CRADA), third-party contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib for additional indications beyond the approved MTC indication in the United States and European Union.\nCabozantinib is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may not result in the necessary regulatory approvals, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize cabozantinib.\nThe activities associated with cabozantinib\u2019s research, development and commercialization, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for cabozantinib would prevent us from promoting its use. We have only limited experience in preparing and filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions is expensive, and often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. For example, before an NDA or NDA supplement can be submitted to the FDA, or MAA to the EMA or any application or submission to regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, the product candidate must undergo extensive clinical trials, which can take many years and require substantial expenditures.\nAny clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. For example, the FDA could determine that the design of a clinical trial is inadequate to produce reliable results. The regulatory process also requires preclinical testing, and data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to approve any NDA or decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. For example, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of cabozantinib for any individual, additional indications.\nIn addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review. Changes in regulatory approval policy, regulations or statutes governing the process for regulatory review during the development or review periods for cabozantinib may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.\nEven if the FDA or a comparable authority in another jurisdiction approves cabozantinib, the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, distribution, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of cabozantinib and may impose ongoing requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. For example, in connection with the FDA\u2019s approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of\nprogressive, metastatic MTC, we are subject to the various post-marketing requirements, including a requirement to conduct a clinical study comparing a lower dose of cabozantinib to the approved dose of 140 mg daily cabozantinib in progressive, metastatic MTC and to conduct other clinical pharmacology and preclinical studies. Failure to complete any post-marketing requirements in accordance with the timelines and conditions set forth by the FDA could significantly increase costs or delay, limit or eliminate the commercialization of cabozantinib. Further, these agencies may also impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nWe are dependent upon our collaborations with major companies, which subjects us to a number of risks.\nWe have established collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including, Ipsen, Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sanofi, Merck (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada) and Daiichi Sankyo, for the development and ultimate commercialization of certain compounds generated from our research and development efforts. Our dependence on our relationships with existing collaborators for the development and commercialization of compounds under the collaborations subjects us to, and our dependence on future collaborators for development and commercialization of additional compounds will subject us to, a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe are not able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or potential future collaborators will devote to the development or commercialization of drug candidates or to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\nwe are not able to control the U.S. commercial resourcing decisions made and resulting costs incurred by Genentech for cobimetinib, which reasonable costs we are obligated to share, in part, under our collaboration agreement with Genentech;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates, or that diminish or delay receipt of the economic benefits we are entitled to receive under the collaboration, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not be successful in their efforts to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not comply with applicable healthcare regulatory laws;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u2022\na collaborator could independently move forward with a competing drug candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;\n\u2022\nwe may be precluded from entering into additional collaboration arrangements with other parties in an area or field of exclusivity;\n\u2022\nfuture collaborators may require us to relinquish some important rights, such as marketing and distribution rights; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay, and may increase the cost of development of our drug candidates.\nIf any of these risks materialize, we may not receive collaboration revenue or otherwise realize anticipated benefits from such collaborations, our product development efforts could be delayed and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to establish collaborations for selected preclinical and clinical compounds.\nWe may pursue new collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and ultimate commercialization of selected preclinical and clinical programs and compounds, particularly those drug candidates for which we believe that the capabilities and resources of a partner can accelerate development and help to fully realize their therapeutic and commercial potential. However, we may not be able to close any such additional collaborations on acceptable\nterms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional collaborations because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing additional collaborations. If we are unable to close additional collaborations on mutually-advantageous terms with partners qualified to achieve the collaboration\u2019s objectives, we may not be able to realize value from a particular drug candidate.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nData breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, maintain and transmit sensitive data on our networks and systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information (such as research data and personal information) and confidential information with respect to our customers, clinical trial patients and our business partners. We have also outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, third parties may or could have access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack and motive (including corporate espionage). Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Over the past year, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications and those of our vendors may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our clinical trial patients, customers and others. Cyber-attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. Our network security and data recovery measures and those of our vendors may not be adequate to protect against such security breaches and disruptions. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to use our technology, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of the intellectual property related to our technologies and products. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We will continue to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as, where and when we deem appropriate. However, these applications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents. Our issued patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties as invalid or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties. As a result, we are from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patent or other intellectual property rights in a court of law, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceeding, foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the United States and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings and litigation may be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our intellectual property without a license and negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, commercialization or use of our product candidates. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patents. In addition, our patents may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages, if, for example, others were the first to invent or to file patent applications for closely related inventions.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which\ncould materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs is also becoming increasingly popular in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to include our products or product candidates, which could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patent and other intellectual property protection, which makes it difficult to stop infringement. We rely on trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, but these measures may not provide adequate protection. While we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants, we cannot assure you that our proprietary information will not be disclosed, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nOur commercial success depends in part upon our ability to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties and not to breach any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and the technologies of third parties. Other parties have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering genes and gene fragments, techniques and methodologies relating to model systems and products and technologies that we have developed or intend to develop. If patents covering technologies required by our operations are issued to others, we may have to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may require us to pay substantial royalties, grant a cross-license to some of our patents to another patent holder or redesign the formulation of a product candidate so that we do not infringe third-party patents, which may be impossible to obtain or could require substantial time and expense.\nThird parties may accuse us of employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, third parties may obtain patents that relate to our technologies and claim that use of such technologies infringes on their patents. Regardless of their merit, such claims could require us to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical personnel, in defending ourselves against any such claims or enforcing our patents. In the event that a successful claim of infringement is brought against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, or at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees and independent contractors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, independent contractors or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers, or used or sought to use patent inventions belonging to their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying money claims, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel and/or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain product candidates, which could severely harm our business.\nRisks Related to Employees and Location\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability to retain and, where necessary, attract additional personnel could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management, as well as clinical and commercial staff, the loss of whose services might adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Also, we may not have sufficient personnel to execute our business plan. Retaining and, where necessary, recruiting qualified clinical and commercial personnel will be critical to support activities related to advancing the development program for cabozantinib and our other compounds, and successfully executing upon our commercialization plan for cabozantinib. Competition is intense for experienced clinical personnel, and we may be unable to retain or recruit clinical and commercial personnel with the expertise or experience necessary to allow us to successfully develop and commercialize our products. Further, all of our employees are employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, may leave our employment at any time.\nOur collaborations with outside scientists may be subject to restriction and change.\nWe work with scientific and clinical advisors and collaborators at academic and other institutions that assist us in our research and development efforts. These advisors and collaborators are not our employees and may have other commitments that limit their availability to us. Although these advisors and collaborators generally agree not to do competing work, if a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services. In such a circumstance, we may lose work performed by them, and our development efforts with respect to the matters on which they were working may be significantly delayed or otherwise adversely affected. In addition, although our advisors and collaborators sign agreements not to disclose our confidential information, it is possible that valuable proprietary knowledge may become publicly known through them.\nOur headquarters are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other disaster could damage our facilities and equipment, which could harm our operations.\nOur headquarters are located in South San Francisco, California, and therefore our facilities are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We do not carry earthquake insurance. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fire, floods, power loss, communications failures, terrorism and similar events since any insurance we may maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired. In addition, the unique nature of our research activities could cause significant delays in our programs and make it difficult for us to recover from a disaster. Accordingly, an earthquake or other disaster could materially and adversely harm our ability to conduct business.\nFacility security breaches may disrupt our operations, subject us to liability and harm our operating results.\nAny break-in or trespass at our facilities that results in the misappropriation, theft, sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical data, or that results in damage to our research and development equipment and assets, could subject us to liability and have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Product Liability\nWe use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. We may face liability for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and such liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts.\nIn addition, our collaborators may use hazardous materials in connection with our collaborative efforts. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, these hazardous materials used by these parties. Further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.\nWe face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our limited insurance coverage.\nWe may be held liable if any product we or our collaborators develop or commercialize causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in decreased demand for our products and product candidates, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of patients from our clinical trials, product recall, substantial monetary awards to third parties and the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop. These claims might be made directly by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or testing our products. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and commercial activities for cabozantinib in the amount of $20.0 million per occurrence and $20.0 million in the aggregate. However, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, if insurance coverage becomes more expensive, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, juries have awarded large judgments in class action lawsuits for claims based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. In addition, the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in general, have been subject to significant medical\nmalpractice litigation. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could harm our reputation and business and would decrease our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and the 2019 Notes\nWe expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline, causing investor losses.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. A number of factors, many of which we cannot control, could subject our operating results to volatility, including:\n\u2022\nthe pace and progress of our current increase in sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution capabilities in anticipation of obtaining FDA approval for cabozantinib for the potential treatment of advanced RCC patients;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate;\n\u2022\nthe successful establishment of the distribution and commercialization network for COMETRIQ in the approved MTC indication and cabozantinib for the potential treatment of advanced RCC patients, as well as the achievement of stated development and commercial milestones, under our collaboration with Ipsen;\n\u2022\nthe progress and scope of other development and commercialization activities for cabozantinib and our other compounds;\n\u2022\nfuture clinical trial results, notably the results from CELESTIAL, our phase 3 pivotal trial in patients with advanced HCC;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nrecognition of upfront licensing or other fees or revenues;\n\u2022\npayments of non-refundable upfront or licensing fees, or payment for cost-sharing expenses, to third parties;\n\u2022\nthe success rate of our efforts leading to milestone payments and royalties;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new technologies or products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and willingness of collaborators to further develop or, if approved, commercialize our product candidates out-licensed to them;\n\u2022\nthe termination or non-renewal of existing collaborations or third party vendor relationships;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates and any approved products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of expenses incurred for clinical development and manufacturing of cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nadjustments to expenses accrued in prior periods based on management\u2019s estimates after the actual level of activity relating to such expenses becomes more certain;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of acquired goodwill and other assets;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our restructuring activities;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our or our collaborators\u2019 research and development expenditures; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section\nDue to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. As a result, in some future quarters, our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be extremely volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and we believe the trading price of our common stock will remain highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as the following, many of which we cannot control:\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in our or our collaborators\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u2022\nannouncement of FDA approval or non-approval, or delays in the FDA review process, of cabozantinib or our collaborators\u2019 product candidates or those of our competitors or actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our, our collaborators\u2019 or our competitors\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate;\n\u2022\nthe timing of achievement of our clinical, regulatory, partnering and other milestones, such as the commencement of clinical development, the completion of a clinical trial, the filing for regulatory approval or the establishment of collaborative arrangements for cabozantinib or any of our other programs or compounds;\n\u2022\nactions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to cabozantinib or our clinical trials for cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our relationships with our collaborators, including the termination or modification of our agreements;\n\u2022\nconflicts or litigation with our collaborators;\n\u2022\nlitigation, including intellectual property infringement and product liability lawsuits, involving us;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfinancing transactions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock or sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel or board members;\n\u2022\nFDA or international regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nthird-party coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\ndisposition of any of our technologies or compounds; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nThese factors, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Excessive volatility may continue for an extended period of time following the date of this report.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock or conversion of our convertible notes, or the perception that such sales or conversions may occur, may depress our stock price.\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, upon the exercise of stock options, upon vesting of restricted stock unit awards, upon sales under our employee stock purchase program, upon exercise of certain outstanding warrants and upon conversion of the Deerfield Notes. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, including upon conversion of the 2019 Notes or the Deerfield Notes, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Trading of the 2019 Notes is likely to influence and be influenced by the market for our common stock. For example, the price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of common stock by investors who view the 2019 Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to occur involving our common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2019 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 470-20, issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature and may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, are required to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument. As a result of the application of ASC 470-20, we recognized $143.2 million as the initial debt discount with a corresponding increase to paid-in capital, the equity component, for the 2019 Notes. We will be required to record the amortization of this debt discount over the\nterms of the 2019 Notes, which may adversely affect our reported or future financial results and the market price of our common stock. In addition, if the 2019 Notes become convertible, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2019 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Finally, we use the if-converted method to compute earnings per share, which could be more dilutive than using the treasury stock method.\nCertain provisions applicable to the 2019 Notes and the Deerfield Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt.\nCertain provisions applicable to the 2019 Notes and the indenture pursuant to which the 2019 Notes were issued, and the Deerfield Notes and the note purchase agreement governing the Deerfield Notes, could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if an acquisition event constitutes a Fundamental Change under the indenture for the 2019 Notes or a Major Transaction under the note purchase agreement governing the Deerfield Notes, holders of the 2019 Notes or the Deerfield Notes, as applicable, will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash. In addition, if an acquisition event constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change under the indenture for the 2019 Notes, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their 2019 Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change. In any of these cases, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2019 Notes and the indenture pursuant to which such notes were issued and the Deerfield Notes and the note purchase agreement governing the Deerfield Notes, could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent or deter attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of us, a change in control, or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our current Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, and similar state provisions, certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credit carry-forwards before utilization. We concluded, as of December 31, 2015, that an ownership change, as defined under Section 382, had not occurred. However, if there is an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code in the future, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs. Furthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating United States federal taxable income. As described above, we have incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; thus, we do not know whether or when we will generate the United States federal taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs. A full valuation allowance has been provided for the entire amount of our NOLs.", "PERMNO": 88159, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EXEL"}
