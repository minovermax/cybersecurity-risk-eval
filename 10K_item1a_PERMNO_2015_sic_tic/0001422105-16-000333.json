{"cik": "1422105", "company": "Noranda Aluminum Holding CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and you should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You also should refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks related to our bankruptcy\nOur bankruptcy proceedings involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\nNoranda HoldCo and its subsidiaries are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the filing of voluntary petitions for a court-supervised restructuring process under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. We cannot assure you regarding the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings. Risks related to the bankruptcy proceedings include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the bankruptcy proceedings from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe period of time that we will operate under the bankruptcy proceedings and our ability to successfully emerge from bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, execute, confirm and consummate a sale or Chapter 11 plan with respect to the bankruptcy proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court and creditor approval of our sale or Chapter 11 plan and the impact of possible alternative proposals, views and objections of creditor committees and representatives, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a sale or Chapter 11 plan in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a reorganization plan, or to convert the bankruptcy proceedings from Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings to Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the bankruptcy proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain appropriate payment and other terms with customers, suppliers and service providers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, motivate and retain management and other key employees;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key vendors or secure alternative supply sources;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain existing customers;\n\u2022\nincreased costs related to the bankruptcy proceedings and other litigation; and\n\u2022\nthe outcome of pre-petition claims against us.\nA long period of operations under Chapter 11 protection may harm our business.\nAs with any judicial proceeding, there are risks of unavoidable delay with a bankruptcy case under Chapter 11.\nSo long as the bankruptcy proceeding continues, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort working on the reorganization, distracting focus from our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Chapter 11 protection may also make it more difficult to attract and retain management and other key personnel necessary to effect a successful reorganization.\nFurthermore, so long as the bankruptcy proceedings continue, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the bankruptcy proceedings. A prolonged continuation of the bankruptcy proceedings may also require us to seek additional financing. If we require additional financing during the bankruptcy proceedings and we are unable to obtain the financing on favorable terms or at all, our chances of successfully reorganizing our businesses may be seriously jeopardized, and as a result, our assets and securities could become further devalued or worthless.\nUnder the Bankruptcy Code, all debtors must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets or engage in other actions outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nobtain financing.\nIn addition, if a trustee is appointed to operate us while we are in bankruptcy proceedings, the trustee would assume control of our assets.\nWhile management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our needs until we emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings, we cannot assure that we will be able to pay all of our expenses. If our liquidity is exhausted prior to our emergence from bankruptcy, a liquidation of the Company pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code likely will occur.\nThere is significant uncertainty as to how our security holders will be treated under any Chapter 11 plan.\nUntil such time that a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed, there will be significant uncertainty as to how holders of our securities will be treated under such a plan.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of our Chapter 11 plan\nThere can be no assurance that a Chapter 11 plan that we develop will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, we cannot assure that we will receive the requisite votes to confirm a Chapter 11 plan. We might also receive objections to confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan from the Unsecured Creditors Committee and other stakeholders in the Bankruptcy Cases, and we cannot predict the impact that any objection might have on the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision as to whether to confirm our Chapter 11 plan.\nOur covenants under our debtor-in-possession credit facilities will likely result in a significant reduction in the scope of our operations.\nUnder our DIP Facilities, we have agreed to take several significant actions related to our business including, among others:\n\u2022\na sale of the assets and property that constitutes our Downstream Business;\n\u2022\nidling our aluminum smelter in New Madrid, Missouri (in effect, suspending the operations of our Primary Aluminum segment); and\n\u2022\nour delivery to the lenders under the DIP Facilities of a five-year business plan, in form and substance acceptable to the Required Lenders (as defined in each of the loans under the DIP Facilities), for the reorganization or other disposition of each part of the Upstream Business and including, among other things, (1) evidence of acceptable new contracts for our chemical grade alumina product; (2) an acceptable marketing plan and timeline for the sale of all our assets in an area known as Orange Valley, in the parish of St. Ann, Jamaica; (3) an acceptable marketing plan and timeline for the sale of all of the Company\u2019s estate assets in New Madrid, Missouri; (4) an acceptable resolution to the renegotiation or rejection of the bauxite supply contract with Sherwin Aluminum Company LLC (\u201cSherwin\u201d), the largest third-party customer of our Bauxite segment; (5) an acceptable plan for the reduction of capital and other expenditures in our St. Ann facilities; and (6) providing for the full payment of the obligations under the DIP Facilities.\nThese measures will result in a significant reduction in the scope of our operations and, coupled with other business challenges we currently confront, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our remaining operations and develop, execute, confirm and consummate a sale or Chapter 11 plan.\nOur sales process with respect to the Downstream Business may not be successful; if completed, the sale of our Downstream Business may not yield sufficient cash, may be negatively affected by factors beyond our control, and may harm our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and service providers\u2019 perception of us.\nA number of factors could influence our ability to successfully raise cash through the sale of the assets and property constituting the Downstream Business, including the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, the process utilized to sell the assets and properties, the number of potential buyers, the purchase price such potential buyers are willing to offer for these assets and properties and a potential buyer\u2019s capacity to fund the purchase, or the ability of a potential buyer to conclude the transaction. One or more of these factors could negatively affect the timing of sale and the amount of cash proceeds derived from the sale, which could adversely affect our cash generation and liquidity. Moreover, there is no assurance that a sale of the assets and property constituting the Downstream Business will result in our raising sufficient cash proceeds or will not harm our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and service providers\u2019 perception of us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the requirements under our DIP Facilities.\nIn addition to standard financing covenants and events of default, the DIP Facilities also include covenants providing for (i) periodic delivery by the Company of various financial statements and (ii) specified milestones that the Company must achieve by target dates set forth in the DIP Facilities, including sale of the Downstream Business, the provision of an acceptable five-year business plan for the reorganization or other disposition of the Upstream Business and entry of an order confirming an acceptable Chapter 11 plan. In addition, among other things, we must maintain minimum levels of Liquidity (as defined in the ABL DIP Loan Agreement).\nA breach of any of the covenants contained in the DIP Facilities could result in an event of default under the DIP Facilities, subject, in certain cases, to applicable grace and cure periods. If any event of default occurs and we are not able either to cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the DIP Facilities, the respective administrative agents under the ABL DIP Loan Agreement and the Term DIP Loan Agreement generally may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, declare all of our outstanding obligations under respective agreements, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, and the respective agents under the ABL DIP Loan Agreement and the Term DIP Loan Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, terminate the lenders\u2019 commitments under the DIP Facilities and cease making further loans, and if applicable, an agent could institute foreclosure proceedings against our pledged assets. This would adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.\nOur DIP Facilities may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.\nOur DIP Facilities may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements or may be restricted or ultimately terminated by the lenders under the DIP Facilities for our breach of the constituent loan agreements. If a Chapter 11 plan that we submit is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, or cash flows and borrowings under the DIP Facilities are not sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, we may be unable to reorganize or otherwise restructure our businesses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation and specified debts arising afterwards (except as may be provided in the plan). With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to February 8, 2016 and before confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Chapter 11 plan or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Chapter 11 plan. Any material claims not ultimately discharged by the Bankruptcy Court could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nWhile we are subject to bankruptcy proceedings, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, sales and other dispositions, restructuring activities, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance most likely will not be indicative of our financial performance after February 8, 2016, the date of our bankruptcy filing. In addition, if we emerge from bankruptcy, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements most likely will change materially relative to historical consolidated financial statements, as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a sale or Chapter 11 plan.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to maintain our operations during the bankruptcy proceeding.\nBecause of our weakened financial condition, we will have heightened exposure to, and less ability to withstand, the operating risks that are customary in our industry, such as fluctuations in the price of primary aluminum and electricity charges. Any of these factors could result in the need for substantial additional funding. A number of other factors, including our bankruptcy filing, our financial results in recent years, our substantial indebtedness and the competitive environment we face, adversely affect the availability and terms of funding that might be available to us during bankruptcy.\nWe depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nWe are dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior management and other key personnel. Our deteriorating financial performance, along with the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, places us at risk of losing personnel critical to the ongoing operation of our business. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to retain any of these persons during or subsequent to the bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain qualified replacements as needed in the future.\nOur senior management and other key personnel may not be able to execute our business plan as currently developed, given the substantial distraction to such individuals caused by the bankruptcy proceedings.\nAs discussed above, the execution of our business plans is dependent on the efforts of our senior management and other key personnel. These individuals may be required to devote significant efforts to the bankruptcy proceedings, thereby potentially impairing their ability to devote their efforts to our business plan. As a result, our business plan may not be implemented as anticipated, which may cause our financial results to materially deviate from those contemplated in the business plan.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nSeveral adverse events have caused us to idle our New Madrid smelter, effectively suspending operations in our Primary Aluminum segment, which has adversely affected our business.\nOn March 12, 2016, we idled our New Madrid smelter, effectively suspending operations in our Primary Aluminum segment. This action was taken as a result several adverse events affecting our Primary Aluminum operations:\nDecline in aluminum prices. The price of our primary aluminum products largely reflects the Midwest Transaction Price (or \u201cMWTP\u201d), which, as explained in more detail in Item 1 of this report under \u201cBusiness - New Madrid Primary Aluminum Smelter - Pricing,\u201d is the sum of the London Metal Exchange (\u201cLME\u201d) price and the Midwest premium. The average MWTP for 2015 was 88 cents per pound, which constitutes a significant decline from the $1.03 per pound average MWTP in 2014.\nReduction cell failures and resulting effects on production process. Beginning in the third quarter of 2014, we experienced an unusually high concentration of reduction cell failures at the New Madrid smelter. Despite our attempts to rebuild and replace failed cells, our timetable for returning the smelter to full production was not met, due to, among other things, the effect that the reduction cell failures and rebuilds have had on other aspects of the production process. The production process issues adversely affected our production costs and results of operations. Therefore, we focused the efforts of our personnel on stabilizing the entire production process. In this regard,\nwe focused on the process and equipment bottlenecks that limited the effectiveness of our previous efforts to restart a large number of pots, rather than on the rebuilding of reduction cells. This decision also was influenced by the sharp drop in aluminum prices that began in May 2015 coupled with the significant investment in labor and materials required to rebuild the reduction cells.\nWhile, during the first half of 2015 we made significant progress in returning production processes that were adversely affected by the reduction cell failures to a steady-state operation, substantial effort continued to be required to eliminate the reliability issues from the smelter. At the time the smelter was idled, we had not cured all reliability issues and had not commenced the rebuilding of reduction cells.\nExplosion at casthouse. On August 4, 2015, an explosion occurred at the smelter\u2019s casthouse. Although the incident affected our production of extrusion billet, it did not affect our molten aluminum production, and we redirected the molten aluminum output to other saleable products such as redraw rod and aluminum ingot. Nevertheless, our inability to produce extrusion billet adversely affected Primary segment operating results, and we had not restored billet production at the time the smelter was idled.\nElectrical supply circuit failure. On January 7, 2016, production was idled at two of the three pot lines at the New Madrid smelter, following an electrical supply circuit failure. As a result, we took steps to move to a one pot line operation and to adjust staffing and other activities in light of the lower level of production until we completely idled operations on March 10, 2016.\nFrom January through March 15, 2016, we terminated or laid off 862 employees at New Madrid. We are unable to predict whether and when operations at the New Madrid smelter will be resumed. If operations are resumed, we cannot assure that our customers and suppliers will resume doing business with us, or that the employees who were terminated or laid off would resume employment with us if offered or that we can raise the funding necessary to restart the facility. The ultimate disposition of our New Madrid smelter will be determined in our bankruptcy proceedings, and will entail many of the risks addressed above under \u201cRisks Related to Our Bankruptcy.\u201d\nThe idling of our New Madrid smelter has eliminated a significant source of demand for alumina produced by our Alumina segment; we cannot assure that we will be able to secure orders from other customers that will enable us to maintain production at the segment\u2019s alumina refinery in Gramercy, Louisiana at or near previous levels.\nA significant portion of the smelter grade alumina production at the Alumina segment\u2019s alumina refinery in Gramercy, Louisiana was supplied to the New Madrid smelter. As a result of the idling of the New Madrid smelter, we have instituted measures to secure customers to purchase alumina volumes that previously would have been directed to the New Madrid smelter. In addition, we are in the process of expanding the Gramercy refinery\u2019s production capacity for non-metallurgical or chemical grade alumina. We are hopeful, but cannot assure, that these measures will enable us to replace the lost volume formerly shipped to New Madrid. Our failure to replace such lost volumes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Bauxite segment operations in St. Ann, Jamaica may be affected by the idling of the New Madrid smelter, the bankruptcy of the segment\u2019s largest third-party customer and an adverse arbitration decision regarding the production levy paid to the GOJ; if we are unable to successfully address the challenges that these events present to our sales and cost structure, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent events have presented challenges to our mining operations in St. Ann, Jamaica. The idling of the New Madrid smelter could have an effect on demand for bauxite supply at our Gramercy refinery if the refinery is not able to maintain its production levels, as discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor. In addition, Sherwin, NBL\u2019s largest third party customer, filed a petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code in January 2016 and reduced its 2016 purchase volume under its contract with us by 500,000 DMT as compared to 2015; mining volumes have been scaled back accordingly. Moreover, on December 18, 2015, an arbitration panel issued a decision adverse to NBL in a dispute between NBL and the GOJ regarding the extent to which NBL must make production levy payments to the GOJ in connection with shipments of bauxite derived from NBL\u2019s mining operations in Jamaica. The decision significantly increased NBL\u2019s costs.\nDuring 2015, we sold approximately 42% of the bauxite from St. Ann to Sherwin under a bauxite supply contract that runs through 2018. The contract has not been profitable for the Company. Accordingly, on February 8, 2016, we filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Cases seeking Bankruptcy Court approval to reject that contract. Sherwin has contested our right to reject the bauxite supply contract. In addition to contesting the rejection motion directly, on March 7, 2016, Sherwin moved to dismiss NBL\u2019s Bankruptcy Case, and separately, to withdraw the reference to the Bankruptcy Court and transfer the rejection motion to the bankruptcy court overseeing Sherwin\u2019s Chapter 11 case. We are vigorously contesting those motions.\nIn January 2016, Sherwin filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. In its Chapter 11 case, Sherwin filed a motion to assume the bauxite supply contract, and proposes to assign the contract to an affiliated entity to which Sherwin proposes to sell substantially all of its assets through a Chapter 11 plan or a sale under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. That motion is adjourned pending further instructions by the bankruptcy court in Sherwin\u2019s Chapter 11 case and is not currently scheduled for a hearing. We and Sherwin have submitted the matter to mediation in an attempt to arrive at mutually acceptable revised contractual terms, but the negotiations to date have not been successful. If we are unable to reach agreement with Sherwin and the contract is rejected, we may not be able to secure a customer or customers that would be willing to purchase bauxite from us at commercially reasonable terms and in sufficient volumes to replace the volumes subject to our bauxite supply contract with Sherwin. If we are unable to reach agreement with Sherwin and the contract is assumed and assigned by Sherwin to an affiliate, we would\ncontinue to be bound by an unprofitable contract. In either event, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIn January 2016, we notified the GOJ that the electrical supply circuit failure at the New Madrid smelter is an event of force majeure that will require NBL to materially reduce mining plans previously provided to the GOJ and related entities. NBL also advised the GOJ that the Sherwin bankruptcy filing may result in additional material reductions to NBL\u2019s mining plans.\nNBL is engaged in efforts to improve productivity, reduce costs, maintain bauxite sales volumes and, with respect to sales to Sherwin, achieve improved pricing. However, if some or all of these efforts are not successful, our business, financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nA downturn in general economic conditions, as well as a downturn in the end-use markets for certain of our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe substantial majority of our products are delivered to destinations in the United States. However, adverse changes in economic conditions in regions outside the United States, may have a negative impact on us due to, among others, lower LME aluminum prices, which are set globally, increased competition due to excess supply or reduced demand for our customers\u2019 products.\nIn addition, certain end-use markets for our rolled products, such as the housing, construction and transportation industries, experience demand cycles that typically are correlated to the general economic environment. Economic downturns in regional and global economies or a decrease in manufacturing activity in these end-use markets, which are sensitive to a number of factors outside our control, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may encounter increases in the cost of raw materials, which could cause our cost of goods sold to increase, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and limiting our operating flexibility.\nIn the production of our products, we require substantial amounts of purchased raw materials, including carbon products and caustic soda. Price volatility of these raw materials can have a significant impact on our costs. If raw material prices increase, we may not be able to pass on the entire cost of the increases to our customers or offset fully the effects of the increases through productivity improvements, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nPrices for the raw materials used by our Downstream Business, including primary aluminum, recycled aluminum and alloying elements, are subject to continuous volatility and may increase from time to time. Our flat-rolled aluminum product sales are generally made on the basis of a specified fabrication premium over the underlying metal price, but if raw material costs other than metal increase, we may not be able to pass on the entire cost of the increases to our customers or offset fully the effects of high raw materials costs through productivity improvements, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, a sustained material increase in raw materials prices may cause some of our customers to substitute other materials for our products.\nWe may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry. We compete with a number of large, well-established companies in each of the markets in which we operate. Historically, our Primary Aluminum segment competed with a large number of other value-added metals producers on an international, national, regional and local basis. We also competed, to a much lesser extent, with primary metals producers, who typically sell to very large customers that require regular shipments of large volumes of metals. Moreover, the idling of our New Madrid smelter has enabled our competitors to focus marketing efforts on the segment\u2019s former customers.\nOur Flat-Rolled Products segment competes in the production and sale of rolled aluminum products with a number of other aluminum rolling mills. Aluminum also competes with other materials, such as steel, copper, plastics, composite materials and glass, among others, for various applications. In the past, customers have demonstrated a willingness to substitute other materials for aluminum in certain applications. In both our Primary Aluminum and Flat-Rolled Products businesses, some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and technical resources than we do. These larger competitors may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions.\nSimilarly, competitors with superior cost positions to ours, particularly those competitors that operate smelters with access to relatively lower raw material, electric power or other production costs, are likely in a better position to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions which, in addition to other challenges to the smelter also adversely affected the long-term viability of our smelter. If we are ever able to resume operation at the smelter but do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our Flat-Rolled Products segment competes with other rolled products suppliers, principally multi-purpose mills, on the basis of quality, price, timeliness of delivery, technological innovation and customer service. A primary competitive factor, particularly in the flat-rolled products business, is price. We may be required in the future to reduce fabrication prices or shift our production to products that generally yield lower fabrication prices in order to remain at full production capacity, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, technological innovation is important to our customers. If we are unable to maintain a leadership position with\nregard to technical innovation or at least utilize technologies that effectively are equivalent to our competitors\u2019 new innovations, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. Increased competition in any of our businesses could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAluminum may become less competitive with alternative materials, which could reduce demand for our products, lower our selling prices and reduce our sales volumes.\nAluminum competes with other materials such as steel, copper, plastics, composite materials and glass for various applications. Higher aluminum prices relative to substitute materials tend to make aluminum products less competitive with these alternative materials. The willingness of customers to accept aluminum substitutes, could result in reduced prices or sales volumes, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations consume substantial amounts of energy and may be adversely affected if energy costs rise.\nElectricity was essential to the operations at the New Madrid smelter prior to its idling; natural gas is essential to our Gramercy refinery, which is energy intensive. The costs of these resources can vary widely and unpredictably. The factors that affect our energy costs tend to be specific to each of our facilities.\nElectricity\nElectricity was the largest cost component at our New Madrid smelter prior to its idling; we considered it a key factor to our long-term competitive position in the Primary Aluminum business. We currently are a party to a long-term power supply agreement with Ameren Missouri, pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase substantially all the electricity required at New Madrid; however, in light of the idling of the New Madrid smelter, we currently are obligated to purchase only a limited, minimum amount of electricity. The power supply contract provides that the rate for power will be established by the Missouri Public Service Commission \u201c(MoPSC\u201d) based on two components: a base rate and a fuel adjustment charge. Any changes to the base rate and fuel adjustment charge must be approved by the MoPSC.\nAmeren Missouri may increase the rates it charges its customers, including Noranda, subject to the approval of the MoPSC. Once a rate case is commenced by the filing of a rate increase request, the MoPSC has eleven months to issue its ruling on the request. From 2008 through May 31, 2015, the electricity rates paid by New Madrid increased due to rate increases approved by the MoPSC, resulting in annual power costs totaling approximately $44 million. On April 29, 2015, the MoPSC established a reduced electricity rate structure for the New Madrid Facility. The reduced rate structure became effective on June 1, 2015 and carries a term of at least three years. The MoPSC\u2019s ruling requires Noranda to meet certain ongoing conditions, including (i) maintaining employment levels at the New Madrid smelter at a daily average of 850 full-time equivalent personnel; (ii) investing an annual inflation-adjusted $35 million in capital expenditures as defined by U.S. GAAP at the New Madrid smelter; and (iii) refraining from paying special dividends. If the New Madrid smelter were not idled, the reduced electricity rate structure would have resulted in $17 to $25 million in annual savings. However, the reduced electricity rate structure did not offset the cumulative impact of the previous rate increases.\nOn May 27, 2015, we received a notice of termination from Ameren Missouri, advising that, effective June 1, 2020, Ameren Missouri is terminating the power supply agreement. However, we believe that, even if the power supply agreement terminates in 2020, Ameren Missouri maintains a legal obligation to supply electricity to the New Madrid smelter, at rates approved by the MoPSC, under a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity issued by the MoPSC in 2005 (the \u201cCertificate\u201d). The Certificate expanded Ameren Missouri\u2019s service area to encompass the New Madrid smelter. Ameren Missouri may not remove the New Madrid smelter from its service area without the express approval of the MoPSC.\nIn addition to base rate adjustments, our electric power costs have been subject to a fuel adjustment clause, under which additional charges could be incurred, based on Ameren Missouri\u2019s fuel costs and off-system sales volume and prices. The fuel adjustment clause resulted in additional fuel charges recorded in cost of goods sold of $10.9 million, $13.2 million and $17.9 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The impact of the fuel adjustment clause can have a dramatic and unpredictable effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nAs a result of workforce reductions at the smelter, we no longer have the requisite number of full-time equivalent personnel mandated by the MoPSC\u2019s April 29 2015 order. On February 3, 2016, the staff of the MoPSC filed a petition asking the MoPSC to determine whether we have materially failed to comply with the workforce level condition. We responded by noting that we were compelled to initiate the workforce reductions by forces beyond our control, thereby triggering the force majeure exception to the condition. On March 2, 2016, the MoPSC found that, through application of the force majeure exception, we have not materially failed to comply with the workforce condition and ordered that the petition of staff of the MoPSC be dismissed. However, even the reduced electricity rate structure for our New Madrid smelter presents a challenge to our ability to restart the smelter. Therefore, we believe that our ability to restart the New Madrid smelter will be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain a more favorable electricity rate than is provided by rate structure currently in effect.\nWe have negotiated an agreement with Ameren Missouri that would provide for a meaningful decrease in our electricity rate, but the agreement is subject to the enactment of proposed emergency legislation in Missouri that would, in effect, provide guidelines for rates under an executed contract between an aluminum smelting facility and an electrical corporation; our agreement with Ameren Missouri\nwould be consistent with the proposed guidelines. While we and Ameren Missouri have both expressed support for the proposed legislation, we are unable to predict if the proposed legislation will ever be enacted and, if it is so enacted, when it would be effective. If such proposed legislation is not adopted, our ability to resume operations at New Madrid would be materially and adversely affected.\nElectricity is also a key cost component at our rolling mill facilities. Electricity is purchased through medium term contracts at industrial rates from regional utilities supplied through local distributors. If we are unable to obtain power at affordable rates upon expiration of these contracts, we may be forced to curtail or suspend operations with respect to a portion of our production capacity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNatural gas\nNatural gas is the largest cost component at our Gramercy refinery and a key cost component at our rolling mill facilities. Our Gramercy refinery purchases natural gas, based on the Henry Hub Index natural gas price, under a contract with a supplier. Our Downstream Business purchases natural gas on the open market. The price of natural gas can be particularly volatile as supply and demand are affected by weather and other factors. Average Henry Hub Index natural gas prices per mmbtu were $2.77 in 2015, $4.35 in 2014, and $3.73 in 2013. Natural gas prices may be subject to significant fluctuations, and we may not be able to mitigate the effect of higher natural gas costs on our cost of sales. Any substantial increases in natural gas costs could cause our operating costs to increase and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have, from time to time, entered into forward swaps to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in natural gas prices. Since January 1, 2013, we have not been a party to any forward swaps for natural gas.\nFuel\nFuel oils such as Bunker \u201cC\u201d and diesel are significant components of the cost structure at our St. Ann bauxite mining operation. Our fuel costs at St. Ann may fluctuate based on the price of oil and we may not be able to mitigate the effect of higher fuel costs. Any increases in fuel costs could cause our operating costs to increase and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we were to lose order volumes from any of our largest customers, our revenues and cash flows could be materially reduced.\nOur business is exposed to risks related to customer concentration. In 2015, our ten largest customers were responsible for approximately 45.3% of our consolidated revenues. In 2015, one customer, Century, accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated revenues. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by lowering sales volumes and increasing costs, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, our customers may become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or default on their obligations to us.\nOn March 9, 2016, Century filed a complaint against Gramercy in the Bankruptcy Cases, seeking a declaratory judgment that it is authorized to exercise certain contractual termination or setoff rights set forth in a contract pursuant to which Gramercy supplies Century with alumina. On March 15, 2016, Century moved for summary judgment, Gramercy\u2019s response to the motion for summary judgment is due on April 6, 2016.\nWe do not have long-term contractual arrangements with a significant majority of our customers, and our revenues and cash flows could be reduced if our customers decide to use other suppliers.\nA majority of our customer contracts have a term of one year or less. Many of our customers purchase products and services from us on a purchase order basis and may choose not to continue to purchase our products and services. The loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchases could have a material and adverse impact on our sales volume and business, or cause us to reduce our prices, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business requires substantial capital investments that we may be unable to fulfill.\nOur operations are capital intensive. Our capital expenditures were $73.4 million, $93.5 million and $87.9 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe may not generate sufficient operating cash flows, and have access to sufficient external financing sources to enable us to make required capital expenditures. Our inability to make upgrades or purchase new facilities and equipment could result in higher maintenance costs and due to the impact of reduced product quality and other competitive deficiencies, lower sales volumes, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nAn adverse decline in the pension liability discount rate, lower than expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect our results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense we record for our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors affecting our liabilities with respect to the plans. We are required to calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions\nused to estimate pension or other post-retirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders equity.\nAlthough U.S. GAAP expense and pension liabilities are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities we would contribute to the pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans\u2019 funded status. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase our liabilities related to such plans, negatively impacting our liquidity and earnings.\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain property, casualty and workers\u2019 compensation insurance, but our insurance does not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum amounts of coverage. We may incur losses that are in excess of the maximum coverage, or are not covered by our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental compliance or remediation. In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in our industries have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nOur New Madrid smelter has sustained damage due to events such as the casthouse explosion and the electrical supply circuit failure. With respect to the casthouse explosion, we have completed our assessment of damage to the facility and have made meaningful progress in addressing structural damage, including roofing, power and lighting repairs. We anticipate that a substantial portion of the loss resulting from the incident will be covered by our property and business interruption insurance. With respect to the electrical supply circuit failure, we are assessing the resulting damage, most of which relates to the reduction cells within the potlines. As was the case with the casthouse explosion, we anticipate that a substantial portion of the loss resulting from the electrical supply circuit failure will be covered by our property and business interruption insurance. Nevertheless, these incidents could have an impact on our ability in the future to obtain insurance at similar levels and costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations present significant risk of injury or death.\nBecause of the heavy industrial activities conducted at our facilities, there exists a risk of injury or death to our employees or other visitors, notwithstanding the safety precautions we take. Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), which in the past has levied fines against us for certain isolated incidents.\nOn August 4, 2015, an explosion occurred at the casthouse on the site of our New Madrid smelter. Promptly after the explosion, our on-site emergency action team, joined by local emergency response units, secured the area and provided medical assistance. No serious injuries resulted; however, a portion of the casthouse has suffered extensive damage. Following its investigation of the incident, OSHA issued a citation against us for what it characterized as a \u201cserious\u201d violation of Section 5 (a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act for \u201cexposing employees to an explosion hazard.\u201d for which it proposed a penalty of $7,000.\nWhile we have in place policies and practices to minimize safety risks, we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any employee or visitor death or injury or other material loss due to property damage that may occur in the future. These types of incidents may not be covered by our insurance policies or may exceed our insurance coverage and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by environmental, safety, production and product regulations or concerns.\nOur operations are subject to a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing emissions to air; discharges to waters; generation, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes; land reclamation; and employee health and safety. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can be costly, and we have incurred and will continue to incur costs, including capital expenditures, to comply with these requirements. Additionally, certain of our raw material suppliers may be subject to significant environmental compliance costs, which they may pass through to us. As these direct or indirect regulatory costs increase and are passed through to our customers, our products may become less competitive than aluminum products provided by other producers, or products based on other materials, which could reduce our sales. If we are unable to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs, including fines and civil or criminal sanctions, or costs associated with upgrades to our facilities or changes in our manufacturing processes to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, environmental requirements change frequently and generally have become more stringent over time. We cannot predict what environmental laws or regulations will be enacted or amended in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be interpreted or enforced, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with such laws or regulations. Our costs of compliance with current and future environmental requirements could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, as an owner and operator of real property and a generator of hazardous waste, we may be subject to environmental cleanup liability, regardless of fault, pursuant to Superfund or analogous state or non-U.S. laws. Thus, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs and costs arising from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, relating to environmental contamination at properties currently or formerly operated by us or at third-party sites at which wastes from our operations have been disposed. Contaminants have been discovered in the soil and/or groundwater at some of our facilities. The discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites could result in significant liability. In addition, because we use or process hazardous substances in our operations, we may be liable for personal injury claims or workers\u2019 compensation claims relating to exposure to hazardous substances.\nWe have disclosed in our consolidated financial statements certain environmental matters that entail liabilities as defined by U.S. GAAP. There could be other significant environmental matters of which we are not aware. The occurrence of new environmental matters or unanticipated developments pertaining to existing environmental matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ongoing operations at the Gramercy facility generate hazardous materials that are disposed of according to long-standing environmental permits. Our asset retirement obligations include costs associated with the future closure and post-closure care of red mud lakes at the Gramercy facility, where Gramercy disposes of wastes from its refining process. We have not recorded an asset retirement obligation for removing such material that may remain at the time of closure of the Gramercy facility as we do not currently believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating the liability. Our ability to form a reasonable estimate is impeded as we cannot predict the amount of hazardous materials that will be remaining at the time of such a closure, due to the fact that we are continuously removing and disposing of these materials as they are generated.\nClimate change legislation or regulation may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nIn several of our operations, we consume energy generated from fossil fuel sources such as coal, diesel and natural gas. A number of governments or government agencies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to significant public and scientific attention to climate change and greenhouse gases. Regulatory and legislative initiatives may affect our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain. In light of the extensive ongoing debate surrounding climate change and the measures that should be adopted to address the issue, we cannot predict the impact of future climate change legislation and regulation. We may incur increased capital expenditures in order to comply with legislative or regulatory changes. In addition, we may be subject to increased energy costs, increased insurance premiums and deductibles and a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes in the demand for the goods we produce, or increases to our raw material costs. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nSome of our facilities are located in areas that have been subject to natural disasters. Future natural disasters in these areas could damage our facilities and disrupt our operations.\nOur aluminum smelter is located in New Madrid, Missouri on the banks of the Mississippi River and near the New Madrid fault line, in an area that may be subject to natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, ice storms and earthquakes. These events could damage our facility, or lead to interruptions in our power supply, which may disrupt our production of aluminum at such time, if ever, as the smelter operations resume. In addition, our bauxite mining operation, which is located in St. Ann, Jamaica, and our alumina refinery, which is located in Gramercy, Louisiana, may be exposed to hurricanes. Our other facilities also may be subject to natural disasters. We maintain insurance to protect us from damages that may result from floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable. There can be no assurance, however, that such insurance will be adequate to completely reimburse us for the losses that might be sustained or would provide sufficient funds for the reconstruction of our facilities. In any event, depending on the severity of the damage sustained by our facilities following a natural disaster, we may not be able to avoid a suspension or disruption of our business while reconstruction is proceeding or while we seek to identify alternative sources of the materials.\nOur business is subject to unplanned business interruptions that may adversely affect our performance.\nOur facilities are subject to unplanned events such as accidents, supply interruptions, transportation interruptions, human error, mechanical failure, information system breakdowns. Operational malfunctions or interruptions at one or more of our facilities could significantly impair our production capacity. As such events occur, we may experience substantial business loss and be required to purchase one of our integrated raw materials at prices substantially higher than our normal cost of production, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, due to our vertical integration, operational malfunctions or interruptions at an Upstream Business facility could materially and adversely affect the performance or operation of other facilities further along our integrated production chain. Such interruptions may harm our reputation among actual and potential customers, potentially resulting in a loss of business. Although we maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events, we may be required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies. In addition, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses, or may not cover certain losses. To the extent these losses are not covered by insurance, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nCyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of our sensitive information, disrupt our business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCybersecurity attacks and security breaches affecting our operations may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches. These could range from uncoordinated individual attacks to advanced persistent threats directed at us. We have experienced such attacks in the past, and based on information currently available to us, they have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cybersecurity threats, we cannot predict the scope and impact of any future cybersecurity incident. While we regularly work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, we cannot assure that such actions will be sufficient to prevent attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events could have a negative impact on our reputation and competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could experience labor disputes that disrupt our business.\nWe are a party to seven collective bargaining agreements with five different unions.\nIn the United States: we have agreements with the United Steelworkers of America and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.\nAt St. Ann, Jamaica: we have agreements with the University and Allied Workers Union; the Union of Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Personnel; and the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union.\nAs customary in Jamaican labor practices, unions generally submit claims subsequent to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements. Until a new agreement is ratified, we continue to operate under the terms of the expired agreement, and, once signed, the new agreement is retroactive to the previous expiration date.\nLabor negotiations for renewal of bargaining agreements may not conclude successfully and, in that case, may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or result in work stoppages or labor disturbances, that may disrupt our operations. Any such cost increases, stoppages or disturbances could materially limit plant production, sales volumes and profitability, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, as a result of our Chapter 11 filing we are currently undergoing negotiations with labor unions representing employees of our Bauxite, Alumina and Primary Aluminum segments to modify our collective bargaining agreements. If we cannot reach agreement on such modifications, we likely will be required to reject the collective bargaining agreements in accordance with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nOur foreign operations have been and will continue to be exposed to various business and other risks, changes in conditions and events beyond our control in foreign countries, also could adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct our bauxite mining operation in St. Ann, Jamaica. We are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks in connection with our foreign operations. These risks include those associated with political or financial instability, expropriation, renegotiation or nullification of agreements, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to taxation, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings. While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict and beyond our control, any one or more of them could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. In addition economic conditions may be more volatile, legal and regulatory systems less developed and predictable and the possibility of various types of adverse government action more pronounced in foreign countries than in the United States. We have been in a dispute with the GOJ with regard to the amount of production levy payments payable to the GOJ. The dispute was submitted to arbitration, and in December 2015, the arbitration panel issued a decision adverse to us. See Note 21, \u201cNon-Controlling Interest\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the arbitration proceeding. The unfavorable outcome, in the arbitration could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our operations and the commercial markets for our products could also be materially and adversely affected by acts of war, terrorism or the threat of these events; government actions such as controls on imports, exports and prices, tariffs, new forms of taxation or changes in fiscal regimes; and increased government regulation in countries where the manufacture or consumption of aluminum products occur. Unexpected or uncontrollable events or circumstances in any of these markets could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur SEC filing obligations are suspended, and publicly available information about us will be limited.\nOur SEC filing obligations have been suspended, and this annual report on Form 10-K, including any amendments to this report, is the last report we will file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, unless, on the first day of any subsequent year, we again become subject to the reporting obligations in accordance with the provisions of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As a result, publicly available information with respect to our company will be limited going forward.", "PERMNO": 93382, "SIC": 3334, "TIC": "NORNQ"}
