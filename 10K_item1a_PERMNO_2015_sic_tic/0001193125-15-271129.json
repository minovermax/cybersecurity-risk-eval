{"cik": "711377", "company": "NEOGEN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in Neogen Corporation\u2019s common shares involves a high degree of risk. The risks described below are not the only ones that an investor faces. Additional risks that are not yet known to us or that we currently think are immaterial could also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business strategy is dependent on successfully identifying and integrating acquisitions as well as promoting internal growth.\nOur business has grown significantly over the past several years as a result of both internal growth and acquisitions of existing businesses and their products. Identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities, integrating these acquisitions into our business and managing their growth requires a significant amount of management\u2019s time and skill. We cannot assure that we will be effective in identifying, integrating or managing future acquisition targets. Our failure to successfully integrate and manage a future acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, if we continue to experience growth in our business, such growth could place a significant strain on our management, customer service, operations, sales and administrative personnel, and other resources. To serve the needs of our existing and future customers we will be required to recruit, train, motivate and manage qualified employees. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to retain qualified management, sales and marketing, engineering, production, manufacturing and administrative personnel, as well as expenses for marketing and promotional activities. Our ability to manage our planned growth depends upon our success in expanding our operating, management, information and financial systems, which might significantly increase our operating expenses.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our future growth, and if we fail to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe rely significantly on our information systems and telecommunications infrastructure to support our operations and a security breach of the Company\u2019s information systems could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and have an adverse effect on operations and results.\nWe rely on information systems and telecommunications infrastructure to integrate departments and functions, to enhance our ability to service customers, to improve our control environment and to manage our cost reduction initiatives. Any issues involving our critical business applications and infrastructure may adversely impact our ability to manage operations and the customers we serve. In addition, if the Company\u2019s security and information systems are compromised, or employees fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, as well as results of operations, and could result in litigation, the imposition of penalties, or significant expenditures to remediate any damage to persons whose personal information has been compromised.\nDisruption of our manufacturing and service operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe manufacture our products at several manufacturing facilities located in Lansing, Michigan; Lexington, Kentucky; Randolph, Wisconsin; Kenansville, North Carolina; Pleasantville, Iowa; and Ayr, Scotland. We offer genomics services from a facility located in Lincoln, Nebraska. These facilities and our distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from terrorism. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\nOur dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results.\nWe rely on third party suppliers to provide components in our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves, including package delivery services. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a negative effect on our results of operations. The\nrisks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with their contractual obligations. In addition, we currently purchase some raw materials and products from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. Problems with suppliers could negatively impact our ability to supply the market, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers.\nWe rely heavily on third party package delivery services, and a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.\nWe ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express, UPS and DHL. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third party package delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of our third party package delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur business sells many products through distributors, which presents risks that could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe sell many of our products outside of the U.S. through distributors. As a result, we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the U.S. Our distributors sometimes offer products from several different companies, and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors\u2019 products and promote our competitors\u2019 products over our own products. We have limited ability, if any, to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting, marketing, selling and supporting our products. We cannot assure that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market, sell and support our products effectively. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or region, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. In addition, violations of anti-corruption laws or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business, and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction. Failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the U.S. may reduce sales, increase expenses and weaken our competitive position, which could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nThe development of new products entails substantial risk of failure.\nWe are continually developing new products for which we believe there should be significant market demand. We cannot assure that we will successfully develop commercially viable products, that the products will be developed on a timely basis to meet market demand or that the relevant market will be properly identified. If we expend substantial resources in developing an unsuccessful product, operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations are subject to different product standards as well as other operational risks.\nIn fiscal 2015, sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 36.7% of the Company\u2019s total revenue. We expect that our international business will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Foreign regulatory bodies may establish product standards different from those in the U.S. and with which the Company\u2019s current products do not comply. Our potential inability to design products that comply with foreign standards could have a material adverse effect on our future growth. Other risks related to our sales to customers outside of the United States include possible disruptions in transportation, difficulties in building and managing foreign distribution, fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies, changes in import duties and quotas and unexpected economic and political changes in foreign markets. These factors could adversely affect international sales and our overall financial performance.\nThe markets for our products are extremely competitive, and our competitors may be able to utilize existing resource advantages to our detriment.\nThe markets in which the Company competes are subject to rapid and substantial changes in technology and are characterized by extensive research and development and intense competition. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, research and development and management resources than we do. These competitors might be able to use their resources, reputations and ability to leverage existing customer relationships to give them a competitive advantage over us. They might also succeed in developing products that are more reliable and effective than our products, make additional measurements, are less costly than our products or provide alternatives to our products.\nWe are dependent on the agricultural marketplace, which is affected by factors beyond our control.\nOur primary customers are in the agricultural and food production industries. Economic conditions affecting agricultural industries are cyclical and are dependent upon many factors outside our control, including weather conditions or changes in consumption patterns or commodity prices. Any of these factors in the agricultural marketplace could affect our sales and overall financial performance.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. The mix of products sold and the acceptance of new products, in addition to other factors, could contribute to this quarterly variability. We operate with relatively little backlog and have few long-term customer contracts. Substantially all of our product revenue in each quarter results from orders received in that quarter. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on expectation of future revenue levels. A shortfall in expected revenue could, therefore, result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to obtain protection for the intellectual property utilized in our products.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to obtain protection in the United States and other countries for our products by establishing and maintaining intellectual property rights relating to or incorporated into our technology and products. Patent applications filed by the Company may not result in the issuance of patents or, if issued, may not be issued in a form that will be commercially advantageous to us. Even if issued, patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of time we may have patent protection for our products. We also cannot assure that our nondisclosure agreements, together with trade secrets and other common law rights, will provide meaningful protection for the Company\u2019s trade secrets and other proprietary information. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or we are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights domestically or in foreign jurisdictions, we may incur substantial costs and our business, including our business prospects, could be substantially harmed.\nFrom time to time, the Company has received notices alleging that the Company\u2019s products infringe third party proprietary rights. Whether the manufacture, sale or use of current products, or whether any products under development would, upon commercialization, infringe any patent claim will not be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets the patent claim in the context of litigation. When an infringement allegation is made against us, we may seek to invalidate the asserted patent claim and/or to allege non-infringement of the asserted patent claim. In order for us to invalidate a U.S. patent claim, we would need to rebut the presumption of validity afforded to issued patents in the United States with clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. The outcome of infringement litigation is subject to substantial uncertainties, and also the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree. Our defense of an infringement litigation lawsuit could result in significant expense. Regardless of the outcome, infringement litigation could significantly disrupt our marketing, development and commercialization efforts, divert management\u2019s attention and consume our financial resources. In the event that we are found to infringe any valid claim in a patent held by a third party, we may, among other things, be required to:\n\u2022\nPay damages, including up to treble damages and the other party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be substantial;\n\u2022\nCease the development, manufacture, importation, use and sale of products that infringe the patent rights of others, through a court-imposed injunction;\n\u2022\nExpend significant resources to redesign our technology so that it does not infringe others\u2019 patent rights, or develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property, which may not be possible;\n\u2022\nDiscontinue manufacturing or other processes incorporating infringing technology; and/or\n\u2022\nObtain licenses to the infringed intellectual property, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAny development or acquisition of non-infringing products or technology or licenses could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. If we are required to, but cannot, obtain a license to valid patent rights held by a third party, we would likely be prevented from commercializing the relevant product, or from further manufacture, sale or use of the relevant product.\nWe are subject to substantial governmental regulation.\nA portion of our products and facilities are regulated by various domestic and foreign government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Although less than 10% of our revenue is currently derived from products requiring government approval prior to sale, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from products used to monitor and detect the presence of residues that are regulated by various government agencies. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s growth may be adversely affected by the implementation of new regulations. The Company is not aware of any failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations although there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance or failure to comply with any obligations would not impact the business negatively.\nWe are dependent on key employees.\nOur success depends, in large part, on members of our management team. Our loss of any of these, or other, key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company. We maintain certain incentive plans for key employees, and most of these employees have been with the Company in excess of five years. However, we have not executed long-term employment agreements with any of these employees and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Our success also depends, significantly, on our ability to continue to attract such personnel. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified persons when required and on acceptable terms.\nOur business may be subject to product liability claims.\nThe manufacturing and distribution of the Company\u2019s products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims being asserted against us. Regardless of whether we are ultimately determined to be liable or our products are determined to be defective, we might incur significant legal expenses not covered by insurance. In addition, product liability litigation could damage our reputation and impair our ability to market our products, regardless of the outcome. Litigation could also impair our ability to retain product liability insurance or make our insurance more expensive. Although the Company currently maintains liability insurance, we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims. If we are subject to an uninsured or inadequately insured product liability claim, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMarket prices for securities of technology companies are highly volatile.\nThe market prices for securities of technology companies have been volatile in the past and could continue to be volatile in the future. Fluctuations in our financial performance from period to period could have a significant impact on the market price of our common shares.\nOperating results could be negatively impacted by economic, political or other developments in countries in which we do business.\nFuture operating results could be negatively impacted by unstable economic, political and social conditions, including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political instability, or changes in the interpretation or creation of laws and regulations or administrative actions in each of the countries where the Company conducts business, including the United States. Additionally, the Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions and must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues may result in significant income tax adjustments that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s future operating results.", "PERMNO": 75976, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NEOG"}
