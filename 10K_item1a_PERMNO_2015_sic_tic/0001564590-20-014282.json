Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d as discussed in \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d These risk factors are important to understanding this Annual Report, our business and our other filings with the Commission. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report and our other filings with the Commission. These are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock, preferred stock and debt could decline.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (\u201cMD&A\u201d), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nOur business routinely encounters and addresses risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. A discussion about important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in the MD&A section and in the business descriptions in Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks. Our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors\u2019 reactions to those developments will affect our future results.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock\nFailure to repay our Notes\nThe Notes became due on April 17, 2017. Because we did not have sufficient cash on hand and did not generate sufficient cash from operations, the FCC spectrum auction and asset sales, we did not repay the Notes at their maturity. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, approximately $249.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding. While we continue to evaluate all options to effect a successful consensual recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including a refinancing of the Notes, these efforts have been made more difficult and complex by the ongoing litigation with certain purported holders of our Series B Preferred Stock and uncertainty regarding the resolution of the foreign ownership issue, as described under Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts.\u201d We face various risks in our efforts to refinance the Notes, which are beyond our control, including the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in negotiations with the Noteholders, the availability of the capital markets to allow us access to fresh capital to repay the Notes on attractive terms or at all, and the possibility of an attempt by the Series B preferred stockholders to block our refinancing efforts, among others. In addition, we face several negative effects of the Notes not being refinanced which will continue, and may be exacerbated, the longer it takes to effect that refinancing, as described under Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts-Continuing Efforts to Refinance the Notes.\u201d\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in our recapitalization and restructuring efforts. Our failure to repay the Notes at their maturity resulted in an event of default under the Indenture and the Noteholders are able to exercise various remedies against us, including foreclosing on our assets that constitute collateral under the Indenture. The collateral constitutes substantially all of our assets and includes the equity of our subsidiaries that own our FCC licenses, our contractual rights and economic interests in such FCC licenses, and a significant portion of our operating cash. In the event we are unsuccessful in these efforts and one or more Noteholders seek to exercise remedies against us or our assets, we may be required to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, among other things, in order to maximize the value of our company for all of our constituents. While we believe that a Chapter 11 filing may create an avenue to successfully execute on our recapitalization and restructuring strategy, such a filing may also have several negative consequences to our business, including the costs and negative publicity that surrounds such a filing, reduced advertising revenue due to the uncertainty surrounding the filing, the potential need to sell assets (including the equity of our subsidiaries that own our FCC licenses) under distressed circumstances and the risk that we are unable to execute on a successful plan of reorganization and restructuring.\nIn addition, with respect to the announcement on our December 16, 2019 press release, which we summarized above under \u201cOur Continuing Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts,\u201d we cannot assure you that the bank will be successful in raising that financing, that we will be able to raise the additional contemplated first lien asset-based financing or that we will be able to reach agreement that will be acceptable to us.\nWe face several risks relating to the existence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event.\nAs a result of our not having sufficient funds legally available to repurchase all of our Series B preferred stock for which repurchases were requested on October 15, 2013, a \u201cVoting Rights Triggering Event\u201d occurred (the \u201cVoting Rights Triggering Event\u201d) under the Certificate of Designations under which the Series B preferred stock was issued. For more information regarding the Voting Rights Triggering Event, see Note 10 to our 2019 financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. As a result, the holders of the Series B preferred stock have the right to elect two members to our Board of Directors until that event is remedied or the Series B preferred stock is redeemed, waived or amended. Although these directors were elected to the Board of Directors at our Annual Meeting held on June 6, 2014, they both subsequently resigned from their director positions on August 17, 2017. Following these resignations, the holders of the Series B preferred stock to date have not exercised their right to elect two new members to our Board of Directors and those two director positions remain unfilled.\nUntil the Voting Rights Triggering Event is remedied, our business is subject to significant restrictions, unless such restrictions are waived or amended or our Series B preferred stock is refinanced on different terms. Waiving or amending the restrictions described below would require the consent of each holder of Series B preferred stock affected. Under these restrictions, among other things:\n\u2022\nwe are unable to incur any new indebtedness, including indebtedness to refinance the Notes; and\n\u2022\nour ability to make investments or make restricted payments is significantly limited.\nOur ability to undertake certain mergers and consolidations requires the approval of a majority of the shares of the then outstanding Series B preferred stock, provided that, after such merger or consolidation no Voting Rights Triggering has occurred or is continuing.\nThese restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to refinance the Notes and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Voting Rights Triggering Event continues until (i) all dividends in arrears shall have been paid in full and (ii) all other failures, breaches or defaults giving rise to such Voting Rights Triggering Event are remedied or waived by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the then outstanding Series B preferred stock. We do not currently have sufficient funds legally available to be able to satisfy the conditions for terminating the Voting Rights Triggering Event.\nIn addition, we are currently engaged in litigation with a group of the purported holders of our Series B preferred stock, as summarized above under Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness- Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts -The Series B Preferred Stock Litigation.\u201d\nThe failure to repay our Notes and our obligations under our Series B preferred stock adversely affects our financial condition and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated debt is substantial and we are highly leveraged, which adversely affects our financial condition and limits our ability to grow and compete. In addition, the existence of the Voting Rights Triggering Event hampers our operations, and may give the Series B preferred stockholders a basis to block our ability to refinance the Notes. These factors, as well as the risks summarized in the two preceding risk factors, are considerations that lead to our conclusion that, as an accounting matter, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nUpon a change of control, we must offer to repurchase all of the Notes and our Series B preferred stock.\nThe terms of our Notes and Series B preferred stock require us, in the event of a change of control, to offer to repurchase all or a portion of a holder\u2019s (i) Notes at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interests to but excluding the purchase date and (ii) shares at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the liquidation preference of the shares, plus an amount in cash equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends on those shares up to but excluding the date of repurchase. We do not currently have cash to purchase the Notes or the Series B preferred stock and we will not likely have in the future sufficient funds legally available to make Series B preferred stock purchases. If we are required to purchase Notes in a change of control purchase offer and we do not do so, then we would be in default under the Indenture, which could lead, after a 30 day grace period, to an event of default under the Indenture and then the right of Noteholders to exercise various remedies against us, including a foreclosure on our assets that constitutes collateral for the Notes. Substantially all of our assets constitute collateral under the Notes.\nWe have not generated sufficient cash to repay our Notes and our liabilities under our Series B preferred stock, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our Notes and Series B preferred stock, which may not be successful.\nOur cash flows, capital resources and cash raised from the FCC spectrum auction and asset sales were insufficient to repay our Notes at their maturity and satisfy our obligations under our Series B preferred stock. As a result, we need to refinance the Notes or seek their repayment from a combination of sources, which has not yet occurred and at this time we cannot accurately predict when will we be able to do so, if at all. One consequence of this is that we have been forced to reduce or delay investments, acquisitions, the growth of our business generally and capital expenditures and will continue to be in that position until we address the Notes\u2019 maturity. Our monthly cash balances are also significantly less due to the change to pay interest on the Notes on a monthly basis rather than on a semi-annual basis. We face various risks relating to our attempts to sell certain of our assets to raise cash to repay our Notes, including whether we will be able to effect any such sales on attractive terms or at all, the timing of any such sales, their impact on our cash flow and the risks of receiving FCC approval, which we may not be able to obtain. We may not be able to effect any such measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and, even if successful, those actions may not allow us to repay our Notes or satisfy our obligations with respect to our Series B preferred stock.\nAn additional potential consequence is that, if we refinance the Notes, holders of the Series B preferred stock may at the time claim that such refinancing is prohibited by the Certificate of Designations under which the Series B preferred stock was issued. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find sources of cash to pay the Notes. See \u201c-Failure to repay our Notes.\u201d\nIn addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations and own substantive assets through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our Notes and satisfying our obligations under our Series B preferred stock is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our Notes. Each subsidiary\nis a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances, legal, tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the Indenture limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required payments on the Notes.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows or sell assets to repay our Notes, or to refinance our Notes and satisfy our obligations under the Series B preferred stock on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly leveraged and our substantial level of indebtedness adversely affects our financial condition and prevents us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $249.9 million of total debt outstanding which does not include the $185.0 million outstanding under the Series B preferred stock (comprised of approximately $90.5 million in liquidation preference and approximately $94.5 million in accrued dividends). Such amount outstanding under our Series B preferred stock is accounted for as a liability under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Our high indebtedness has had and will continue to have significant effect on our business. Our indebtedness, the terms of the Indenture and the existence of a Voting Rights Triggering Event have had and will continue to have several negative effects on us and creates several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe did not repay the Notes at their maturity, as a result of which there was and continues to be an event of default under the Indenture;\n\u2022\nrequires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest at a rate of 12.5% per year on our Notes, which reduces the funds available for the implementation of our strategy, particularly regarding acquisitions and investments and more generally for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimits our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions and investments, working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, which may limit the ability to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nprevents us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase Notes tendered to us if there is a change of control or other event requiring such a repurchase, and any failure to repurchase Notes tendered for repurchase would constitute a default under the Indenture;\n\u2022\nheightens our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplaces us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt and are not in default as we are;\n\u2022\nlimits management\u2019s discretion in operating our business; and\n\u2022\nlimits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy, or unexpected crises such as the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus.\nEach of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently have sufficient cash on hand and we did not generate sufficient cash from operations or the sale of assets or as a result of the Broadcast Incentive Auction to pay the Notes at maturity. See \u201c-Failure to repay our Notes\u201d.\nThe terms of the Indenture and the Certificate of Designations for the Series B preferred stock restrict our current and future operations.\nThe terms of the Indenture and the Certificate of Designations for the Series B preferred stock contain restrictive covenants that impose significant restrictions on us and may limit, or prevent, our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness, including indebtedness to refinance the Notes;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase or redeem our capital stock and make certain restricted investments and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans and sell assets to the Company and other restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into change of control transactions;\n\u2022\nmanage our FCC licenses and broadcast license subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we are:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to satisfy our current obligations;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing; and\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities, including acquisition opportunities.\nThese restrictions negatively affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face several risks regarding the foreign ownership issue.\nIn light of the foreign ownership issue we summarize above under Part I, Item I, \u201cBusiness-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts-Foreign Ownership Issue\u201d and Part I, Item I, \u201cFederal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting-Foreign Ownership,\u201d under the Communications Act, FCC regulations and our Charter, we face several risks. As a general matter and because of this foreign ownership issue, we have taken the following steps:\n\u2022\nAs a publicly traded company we review Commission filings by third parties regarding the ownership of our securities, though we are dependent in this regard on timely disclosures by third parties and may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time.\n\u2022\nOn November 28, 2017, we notified the purported holders of our Series B preferred stock that we had suspended all of their rights, effective immediately, other than their right to transfer such shares to a citizen of the United States, due to the potential violation of Section 310 of the Communications Act and our Charter resulting from the ownership of a majority of our outstanding Series B preferred stock by foreign persons.\n\u2022\nWe filed Current Reports on Form 8-K on November 28, 2017 and March 26, 2018 with the Commission to publicize and explain the foreign ownership issue and the suspension of rights, among other things.\n\u2022\nIn order to comply with the FCC\u2019s rules establishing procedures to remediate inadvertent noncompliance with the foreign ownership rules, and upon the advice of FCC staff, we also filed a petition for declaratory ruling on December 4, 2017 which we summarize above under \u201cFederal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting - Foreign Ownership.\u201d This petition is currently in abeyance pending resolution of the Series B Preferred Stock Litigation.\n\u2022\nOn April 27, 2018, we issued Notices of Ineffective Purported Purchase of Series B Preferred Stock to four investors notifying them that their claimed ownership of our outstanding Series B preferred stock shall, after the date of these notices, be treated as void and non-existent, unless and until these investors can demonstrate facts to the contrary supported by relevant documentation, because they attempted to acquire these shares in transactions that, if given effect, would have violated the limitations in our Charter regarding foreign ownership, as summarized under Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts-Foreign Ownership Issue.\u201d As of the date of this Annual Report, these investors have not provided us with any facts or provided any documentation that would support a different legal conclusion.\nWe took these actions in order to safeguard our most important assets, our FCC broadcast licenses, which would otherwise potentially be at risk if we failed to take appropriate measures to remain in compliance with the Communications Act.\nOn December 6, 2018, we received a letter from the Enforcement Bureau of the Investigations and Hearings Division (the \u201cBureau\u201d) of the FCC advising us that we were under investigation for potential violations of Section 310(b) of the Communications Act, related to excess foreign ownership of broadcast stations. As part of its investigation, the Bureau requested of the company detailed information and supporting documentation about the identities of the Series B preferred stockholders, the potential for a\nforeign ownership violation, the dates that the Company became aware of the situation, and the steps the Company took to address the situation. We timely filed our response to the Bureau\u2019s letter of inquiry on February 8, 2019. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not received a response or any additional inquiries from the Bureau regarding this investigation.\nA failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership by foreign persons could result in an order to divest the non-compliant ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An FCC ruling denying the relief we requested in our petition for a declaratory ruling could require that we initiate legal proceedings to enforce the protective provisions set forth in our Charter to comply with the foreign ownership provisions of our Charter and the Communications Act, which may take many forms. Further, the FCC could impose a monetary penalty against us and other significant enforcement penalties if the FCC concludes that we were not in compliance with the Communications Act. Any of these would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced net losses in the past and, to the extent that we experience net losses in the future, our ability to raise capital may be adversely affected.\nWe have historically experienced pre-tax net losses in the past. Failure to achieve sustained profitability may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to meet our obligations. Our inability to obtain financing in adequate amounts and on acceptable terms necessary to operate our business, repay our Notes, redeem or refinance our Series B preferred stock or finance future acquisitions negatively impacts our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe face several risks relating to our NOL carry-forwards.\nWe face several risks to our federal and state NOL carry-forwards that were generated from prior period losses. As of December 31, 2019, these NOL carry-forwards amounted to $92.1 million and $91.3 million, respectively, after giving effect to the increases described in Note 13 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nNOL carryforwards generated after 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely. Pre-tax reform NOL carry-forwards may expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. They expire in 2019 through 2037. Based on current information and expectations, it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the use of all these NOL carry-forwards in the future because it may not generate future taxable income sufficient to use them all prior to expiration. As such, at December 31, 2019, the Company has provided a valuation allowance on substantially all of these NOL carry-forward deferred tax assets. See Note 13 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe face the risk that current and future NOL carry-forwards will become subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), and related Treasury Regulations. As a general matter, our ability to utilize NOL carry-forwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an ownership change for purposes of Section 382. A Section 382 ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year testing period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. In 2017, we determined that we underwent ownership changes in 2013 and 2017, which reduced available NOL carry-forwards, as described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We may undergo further, future ownership changes for purposes of Section 382. The risk of such ownership changes is beyond the ability of the Company to control. Such ownership changes could result from future issuances by the Company or sales of our capital stock by and among third parties, including transfers of our Series B preferred stock. The foreign ownership issue regarding our Series B preferred stock, which we describe under \u201cPart 1. Item 1, Business-Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts-Foreign Ownership Issue,\u201d could well make the determination of an ownership change\u201d for purposes of Section 382 more complex and difficult to make. It is possible that any ownership change could materially reduce our ability to use our NOL carry-forwards or other tax attributes to offset taxable income, which could require us to pay more income taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our NOL carry-forwards.\nFinally, we face several risks regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Legislation\u201d). The impact included a provision to reduce the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% and restrictions on our ability to deduct interest expense and to use future generated NOLs to offset future generated income, among other things. Accordingly, the Tax Legislation, as well as any additional tax reform legislation in the United States or elsewhere or future regulations or interpretations of the Tax Legislation, could affect our business and financial condition by, among other things, decreasing the value of our NOL carry-forwards. In addition, assessing the overall impact of this and other legislation on the value of our NOL carry-forwards is difficult to do for several reasons, including due to the difficulty of making projections of future taxable income.\nThe risks we summarize above are beyond our ability to control and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we compete for advertising revenue with other broadcast stations, as well as other media, many operators of which have greater resources than we do.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and the success of our stations is primarily dependent upon their share of overall advertising revenues within their markets, especially in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. Our broadcast stations compete in their respective markets for audiences and advertising revenues with other broadcast stations of all formats, as well as with other media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, satellite radio, cable services, outdoor advertising, direct mail, Internet radio, smart phones, tablets and other wireless media, the Internet and social media such as Facebook and Twitter. In addition, any changes in the methods used to determine ratings could result in a downward adjustment in our ratings, which could adversely affect our advertising sales in the markets in which we operate.\nAlthough we believe that each of our broadcast stations is able to compete effectively in its respective market, our stations may be unable to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues. Specifically, radio stations can change formats quickly. Any other radio station currently broadcasting could shift its format to duplicate the format of, or develop a format which is more popular than, any of our stations. If a station converts its programming to a format similar to that of one of our stations, or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations, the ratings and station operating income of our station in that market could be adversely affected. Further, we could also lose some of our on-air personalities, which may adversely affect our competitive position in those markets. In addition, other radio companies which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have may also enter markets in which we operate. A bankruptcy filing could also have an adverse impact on our advertising revenue as advertisers may decide to advertise with our competitors due to any ongoing business uncertainty that may result from such bankruptcy filing. See \u201c-Failure to repay our Notes.\u201d\nAny of these events could cause our stations\u2019 audience ratings, market shares and advertising revenues to decline and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our business as a whole.\nCOVID-19 will likely have a negative effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows but it is difficult to predict that impact with certainty.\nGiven the nature of our business, COVID-19, also known as the Coronavirus, will likely have a negative effect on our business, though it is difficult to predict with certainty or precision the degree of impact. Advertising revenue, and in particular cash advertising sales, makes up the majority of our revenue, and, like other radio and TV broadcast companies and similar businesses that depend on advertising spend, we expect to experience a decline in this revenue stream due to COVID-19. In response to this current health crisis, governmental authorities have imposed certain restrictions, including travel bans and recommendations on the limitation of social gatherings. The health dangers of COVID-19, the length of time it will last, the impact these things will have on the general economy and in the markets in which operate are unknowns at this time, and may be unknown for some time to come. While we believe that our radio and TV businesses will prove ultimately resilient in the face of a possible recession, the factors mentioned in the last sentence make it difficult to predict with certainty or precision the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows, and that impact could be material.\nA large portion of our net revenue and operating income currently comes from our New York, Los Angeles and Miami markets.\nOur New York, Los Angeles and Miami markets accounted for more than 65% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Therefore, any volatility in our revenues or operating income attributable to stations in these markets could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated net revenue or operating income. A significant decline in net revenue or operating income from our stations in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The recent uncertainty surrounding the public health concerns over the global outbreak of COVID-19 have caused significant disruptions in these markets and uncertainty in their economic outlook.\nSince our revenues are concentrated in these markets, an economic downturn, increased competition or another significant negative event in any of these markets , including the recent outbreak of COVID-19, could reduce our revenues and results of operations more dramatically than other companies that do not depend as much on these markets.\nCancellations, reductions, delays and seasonality in advertising could adversely affect our net revenues.\nWe do not generally obtain long-term commitments from our advertisers. As a result, our advertisers may cancel, reduce or postpone orders. Cancellations, reductions or delays in purchases of advertising time could adversely affect our net revenue, especially if we are unable to replace these purchases. The recent uncertainty surrounding the public health concerns over the global outbreak of COVID-19 have caused significant disruptions and uncertainty in the financial markets and global economic outlook. These economic conditions, including lower economic growth rates, may remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We believe that as a result, our customers may alter their purchasing activities in response to the current and future economic environments, and, among other things, our customers may change or scale back future purchases of advertising leading to increased cancellations, reductions or postponed orders. Our expense levels are based, in part, on expected future net revenues and are relatively fixed once set. Therefore, unforeseen decreases in advertising sales could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and operating income.\nIn addition, we experience fluctuations in our broadcasting revenue primarily due to seasonal variations in advertising expenditures by local, regional and national advertisers, causing our net broadcasting revenues to vary throughout the year. Historically, our first calendar quarter (January through March) has generally produced the lowest net broadcasting revenue for the year because of routine post-holiday decreases in advertising expenditures.\nThe effects of such seasonality, combined with any other changes in our broadcasting revenue, make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results.\nThe success of our radio stations depends on the popularity and appeal of our content, which is difficult to predict.\nWe format the programming of each of our radio stations to capture a substantial share of the U.S. Hispanic audience in their respective markets. The U.S. Hispanic population is diverse, consisting of numerous identifiable groups from many different countries of origin and each with its own musical and cultural heritage. Various factors could impact the popularity of our content, including shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, audience tastes and fluctuations in preferred advertising media. The success of our radio stations depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and broadcast content that meets the changing preferences of this broad consumer market. If we are not successful at maintaining and growing the popularity of our content, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our television operation depends upon our ability to attract viewers and advertisers to our broadcast television operation.\nIn 2019, our television segment was profitable and we recorded positive consolidated operating income for our television segment under our Indenture, however, we may not achieve profitability in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract viewers and advertisers to our broadcast television operation. If we cannot attract viewers, our television operation may suffer from low ratings, which in turn may deter potential advertisers. The inability to successfully attract viewers and advertisers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results for our television operation. Television programming is a highly competitive business. Television stations compete in their respective markets for audiences and advertising revenues with other stations and larger, more established networks. As a result of this competition, our rating share may not grow, and an adverse change in our local markets could have a material adverse impact on the revenue of our television operation.\nThe success of the television operation is largely dependent on certain factors, such as the extent of distribution of the developed programming, the ability to attract viewers and advertisers, the ability to acquire programming, and the market and advertiser acceptance of our programming. We may not be successful in our initiatives, and our initiatives may fail to generate revenues and may ultimately be unprofitable.\nThe loss of distribution agreements could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur MegaTV television operation has entered into station distribution agreements that allow us to serve markets representing over 3.1 million Hispanic households. If our distribution agreements are terminated or not extended, our ability to reach our viewers and receive licensing fees may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we expect to renew these agreements or make other arrangements to reach viewers, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. We receive advertising inventory from our affiliated stations, either in the form of stand-alone advertising time within a specified time period or commercials inserted by MegaTV into its programming. In addition, primarily with respect to Multichannel Video Programming Distributors, we receive a fee for providing such programming. The loss of distribution agreements\nof our MegaTV television operation could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our network programming and, therefore, its attractiveness to advertisers. Renewal on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations through the reduction of advertising revenue and fees.\nOur business is affected by natural catastrophes that can disrupt our operations, including by causing failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities that we depend upon to distribute our programming.\nWe use studios, satellite systems, transmitter facilities and the Internet to originate and/or distribute our station and network programs and commercials to affiliates. We rely on third-party contracts and services to operate our origination and distribution facilities. These third-party contracts and services include, but are not limited to, electrical power, satellite transponders, uplinks and downlinks and telecom circuits. Distribution may be disrupted due to one or more third parties losing their ability to provide particular services to us, which could adversely affect our distribution capabilities. A disruption can be caused as a result of any number of events such as local disasters (accidental or environmental), including hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, flooding or other severe weather, various acts of terrorism, power outages, major telecom connectivity failures or satellite failures. Our ability to distribute programming to station audiences and/or network affiliates may be disrupted for an undetermined period of time until alternate facilities are engaged and put on-line. Furthermore, until third-party services resume, the inability to originate or distribute programming could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.\nAlthough we maintain insurance that we believe is customary and appropriate for our business, we cannot assure you that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or underinsured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nWe must respond to rapid changes in technology, content creation, services and standards in order to remain competitive.\nVideo, telecommunications, radio and data services technologies used in the entertainment industry are changing rapidly. Advances in technologies or alternative methods of product delivery or storage, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery and storage, could have a negative effect on our businesses. Examples of the foregoing include the convergence of television broadcasts and online delivery of programming to televisions and other devices, video-on-demand platforms, tablets, satellite radio, user-generated content sites, Internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading, and place-shifting of content from the home to portable devices on which content is viewable outside the home. For example, devices that allow users to view or listen to television or radio programs on a time-delayed basis; technologies, such as DVRs, that enable users to fast-forward or skip advertisements or increase the sharing of subscription content; systems that allow users to access our copyrighted product over the Internet or other media; and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to view programming or store or make portable copies of programming, may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and adversely affect our revenues. Also, the growing uses of user-generated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact our businesses. In addition, further increases in the use of Internet-connected television or other digital devices, which allow users to consume content of their own choosing, in their own time and remote locations while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements or subscription payments, could adversely affect our radio and television broadcasting advertising and subscription revenues. Users who reduce, cancel or never had cable television subscription services are also known as \u201ccord-cutters\u201d or \u201ccord-nevers\u201d. Cable providers and DBS operators are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television marketplace into more specialized niche audiences. More television and video programming options increase competition for viewers and competitors targeting programming to narrowly defined audiences may gain an advantage over us for television advertising and subscription revenues. Television manufacturers, cable providers and others are developing and offering technology to enable viewers to locate digital copies of programming from the Internet to view on television monitors or other devices, which could diminish viewership of our programming. Generally, changing consumer behavior may impact our traditional distribution methods, for example, by reducing viewership of our programming, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability. Anticipating and adapting to changes in technology on a timely basis and exploiting new sources of revenue from these changes will affect our ability to continue to increase our revenue. Our inability to successfully implement our recapitalization strategy may adversely affect our ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology on a timely basis or at all.\nCybersecurity risks could affect our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on the security and reliability of information and communications technology, systems, networks and the Internet. We rely on our information technology systems and those of third-party providers to manage our business data, communications, advertising content, order entry, and other business processes. Additionally, our information technology systems and processes need to support the future growth of our business and require modifications or upgrades, from time to time. Such use and development exposes us to potential computer system and network failures and cyber incidents, resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events caused by circumstances beyond our control, including power outages, catastrophic events and natural disasters. We therefore face the risk of an event or attack, resulting in remediation costs, increased cyber security protection costs, lost revenue, legal risks and reputational damage. Despite our security measures, we have been the target of cyber-attacks, including phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, and future attacks are likely to occur including network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, cyber threats, security breaches, viruses or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, or malicious other activities. While no cyber-attack has had a material impact on the Company thus far, if successful, these attacks could also result in unauthorized access and disclosure of nonpublic corporate or personal information and other sensitive information, the adverse disruption of our services and operations, misstated financial information, liability for stolen assets or information and financial consequences which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent upon the performance of key employees, on-air talent and program hosts. Cost increases in the retention of such employees may adversely affect our profits.\nOur business depends upon the efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including on-air talent, and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. We employ or independently contract with several on-air personalities and hosts with significant loyal audiences in their respective markets. Although we have entered into long-term agreements with some of our key on-air talent and program hosts to protect our interests in those relationships, these key on-air personalities and program hosts may not remain with us or may not retain their audiences. Competition for these individuals is intense, and many of our key employees are at-will employees who are under no legal obligation to remain with us. Our competitors may choose to extend offers to any of these individuals on terms which we may be unwilling to meet. In addition, any or all of our key employees may decide to leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control. Furthermore, the popularity and audience loyalty of our key on-air talent and program hosts is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes. A loss of such popularity or audience loyalty is beyond our control and could limit our ability to generate ratings and revenues.\nThe loss of any of our executive officers and key employees, particularly Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our personnel.\nWe produce and acquire programming and content and incur costs for all types of creative talent, including on-air talent, programming and production personnel. An increase in the costs of such programming and content or in the costs for creative talent may lead to decreased profitability.\nImpairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives can cause our net income or net loss to fluctuate significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $344.1 million of unamortized intangible assets, including goodwill of $32.8 million and FCC broadcast licenses of $311.3 million on our consolidated balance sheet. These unamortized intangible assets represented approximately 73% of our total assets. Accounting standards require that goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, such as FCC broadcast licenses, are not amortized. Accounting standards require that goodwill and certain intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment. If we find that the carrying value of goodwill or FCC broadcast licenses exceeds their fair value, we will reduce the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset to the fair value and will recognize an impairment loss in our results of operations.\nWe currently account for our FCC broadcast licenses as indefinite-lived assets. In the event we are no longer able to conclude that our FCC broadcast licenses have indefinite lives, we may be required to amortize such licenses. The amortization of our FCC broadcast licenses would affect our earnings and earnings per share.\nThe impairment tests require us to make estimates of the fair value of our intangible assets, which is determined by using a discounted cash flow methodology. Since a number of factors may influence the fair value of our intangible assets, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles will occur in the future. From time to time in the past, we have incurred significant impairment charges, which have materially adversely affected our results of operations.\nAny future impairments would result in our recognizing a corresponding operating loss, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPiracy of our programming and other content, including digital and Internet piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of our programming and other content and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nPiracy of programming is prevalent in many parts of the world and is made easier by technological advances allowing conversion of programming and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of our content. We believe that the proliferation of unauthorized copies and piracy of these products has an adverse effect on our business and profitability because these products reduce the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our media content.\nDamage to our brands or reputation could adversely affect our company.\nOur brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain advertisers for our broadcast stations depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of our company, our ability to produce attractive programming, the strength of our audience and our integrity. Damage to our brands or reputation or negative publicity or perceptions about us, either through infringement of our brands, intellectual property or otherwise, could cause a loss of consumer or advertiser confidence in our company and may adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our employees.\nIn recent years, a number of employers, including us, have been subject to lawsuits, including alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace, wage-hour and employment discrimination matters, class action lawsuits, and a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. We could also face potential liability if we are found to have misclassified certain employees as exempt from the overtime requirements of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor laws, or for having classified certain personnel as contractors and not as employees under applicable law. We have had and now have some employment-related administrative proceedings and lawsuits pending against us, although none involving class allegations and none that we believe to be material.\nRa\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, has majority voting control of our common stock and 100% voting control of our Series C preferred stock and this control may discourage or influence certain types of transactions or strategic initiatives.\nRa\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owns shares of common stock representing approximately 85% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2019. Such combined voting power includes Mr. Alarc\u00f3n\u2019s voting control over 380,000 shares of Series C preferred stock (convertible into 760,000 shares of Class A common stock) pursuant to his capacity as trustee for the AAA Trust. As a result, Mr. Alarc\u00f3n generally has the ability to control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our entire Board of Directors, mergers and acquisitions and sales of all or substantially all of our assets, and our recapitalization strategy. Mr. Alarc\u00f3n\u2019s voting power may allow him to have a greater influence on our corporate strategy than other equity holders.\nWe cannot assure you that Mr. Alarc\u00f3n will maintain all or any portion of his ownership or that he would continue as an officer or director if he sells a significant part of his stock. Further, the disposition by Mr. Alarc\u00f3n of a sufficient number of shares could result in a change in control of our company, which could trigger a variety of federal, state and local regulatory consent requirements and potentially limit our utilization of NOLs for income tax purposes, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the secondary market prices of our securities.\nBecause our stock currently trades below $5.00 per share, and is quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market, our stock is considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which can adversely affect its liquidity.\nAs the trading price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements. The broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent prior to the transaction.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity of our common stock in the secondary market because few brokers or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities. Purchasers of our common stock may find it difficult to resell the shares in the secondary market.\nThere may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their securities. The market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nWhile our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market of the OTC Markets, our common stock is thinly traded and should be considered an illiquid investment. The market price of our common stock will likely be highly volatile, as is the stock market in general, and the market for over the counter quoted stocks in particular. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control, such as conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common stock. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance. In addition, the illiquidity and volatility of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital or successfully implement our recapitalization strategy. Any further impact on our ability to successfully implement our recapitalization strategy will likely continue to adversely affect our ability to execute our long-term business strategy, including any efforts to use equity capital to finance selective acquisitions, reduce our indebtedness or fund our operations.\nRisks Related to Legislative and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in U.S. communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe television and radio broadcasting and distribution industries in the United States are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The television and radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. For example, we are required to obtain, and periodically renew, licenses from the FCC to operate our radio and television stations. The FCC may not approve our future renewal applications, or it may approve them for less than the full term or subject to conditions or qualifications. Although a station can continue to operate under its expired license pursuant to FCC rules until the FCC takes action on its renewal application and the FCC grants renewal of broadcast licenses in the great majority of cases, we cannot be assured that our licenses will be renewed on favorable terms or at all in future renewal cycles. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must also comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our television and radio stations and our television network. FCC regulations limit the number of television and radio stations that a licensee can own in a market and the household reach of television stations nationwide. Under the Communications Act, every three years each television broadcast station is required to elect to exercise the right, either to require cable television system and DBS operators in its local market to carry its signal (must carry), or to prohibit carriage or condition it upon payment of a fee or other consideration. These \u201cmust carry\u201d rights are not absolute, and under some circumstances, a cable system or DBS operator may be entitled not to carry a given station. The FCC\u2019s current rules require cable and DBS operators to carry only one channel of the digital signal of our television stations, despite the capability of digital broadcasters to broadcast multiple program streams within one station\u2019s digital allotment. Cable systems and DBS operators may not continue to carry our owned or affiliated television broadcast stations. The failure of a cable system or DBS operator to carry one of our owned or affiliated television stations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation and ownership of our radio and television properties. For example, from time to time, proposals have been advanced in the U.S. Congress and at the FCC to require radio and television broadcast stations to provide advertising time to political candidates for free or at a reduced charge. Any restrictions or reductions in rates on political advertising may adversely affect our advertising revenues. The FCC has initiated a proceeding to examine and potentially regulate more closely embedded advertising, such as product placement and product integration. Enhanced restrictions affecting these means of delivering advertising messages may adversely affect our advertising revenues. The FCC is currently engaged in a review of its media ownership rules. Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by us. We are unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on our operations.\nProposed legislation would require radio broadcasters to pay royalties to record labels and recording artists.\nLegislation has been previously introduced in Congress that would require radio broadcasters to pay a royalty to record labels and performing artists for use of their recorded songs. Thus far, the legislation has failed to pass, but it may be reintroduced in the future. Currently, we pay royalties to song composers and publishers through Broadcast Music, Inc., the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and SESAC, Inc. The proposed legislation would add an additional layer of royalties to be paid directly to the record labels and artists. In addition, radio and recording industry representatives have entered into negotiations in the past that could result in an agreement to resolve the performance fee issue. It is currently unknown what proposed legislation, if any, will become law, whether industry groups will enter into an agreement with respect to fees, and what significance this royalty would have on our results from operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe FCC vigorously enforces its indecency and other program content rules against the broadcast industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules and regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent/profane material because of the vagueness of the FCC\u2019s indecency/profanity definition, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC vigorously pursues its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency and has threatened on more than one occasion to initiate license revocation or license renewal proceedings against a broadcast licensee who commits a \u201cserious\u201d indecency violation. The FCC has substantially increased its monetary penalties for violations of these regulations pursuant to law enacted in 2006 that provides the FCC with authority to impose fines of up to $414,454 per incident or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3,825,726 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. Moreover, the FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent \u201cutterance,\u201d in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation.\nIn July 2010, the Second Circuit issued a decision in which it vacated the FCC\u2019s indecency policy as unconstitutional. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which held that the FCC could not fine ABC and Fox for the specific broadcasts at issue in that case because the FCC had not provided them with sufficient notice of its intent to issue fines for the use of fleeting expletives. However, the Court did not make any substantive ruling regarding the FCC\u2019s indecency standards. In April 2013, the FCC requested comments on its indecency policy, including whether it should ban the use of fleeting expletives or whether it should only impose fines for broadcasts that involve repeated and deliberate use of expletives. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts its review of its indecency policies generally and in 2015 issued a Notice of Apparent Liability for the then-maximum forfeiture amount of $325,000 against a television station for violation of its indecency policy. We cannot predict whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area.\nThe FCC\u2019s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme against the broadcast industry generally may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations. In addition, we have in the past been the subject and may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our stations\u2019 broadcast of allegedly indecent or obscene material. To the extent that these pending inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected. We also face increased potential costs in the form of fines for indecency violations, and we cannot predict whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area.\nOur businesses depend upon licenses issued by the FCC, and if any of those licenses were not renewed or we were to be out of compliance with FCC regulations and policies, our business may be materially impaired.\nOur businesses depend upon maintaining their broadcasting licenses issued by the FCC, which are issued currently for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal thereafter. Interested parties may challenge a renewal application. On rare occasions, the FCC has revoked licenses, not renewed them, or renewed them with significant qualifications, including renewals for less than a full term of eight years. In the past, a few of our stations have operated on expired licenses while their applications for renewal remain pending. We cannot be certain that our future renewal applications will be approved or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect our operations or result in material impairments, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our FCC licenses are not renewed, we could be prevented from operating the affected station and generating revenue from it.\nFurther, the FCC has a general policy restricting the transferability of a station license while a renewal application for that station is pending, and we must comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies governing the ownership and operation of our stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio and television stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions. The FCC\u2019s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on their operations, and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. If the FCC relaxes these technical requirements, it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the FCC has recently increased its enforcement of certain regulations, including regulations requiring a radio station to include an on-air announcement which identifies the sponsor of all advertisements and other matter broadcast by any radio station for which any money, service or other valuable consideration is received, and for failure to comply with requirements regarding the maintenance of public inspection files for each radio station, which are maintained on an FCC database and therefore are easily accessible by members of the public and the FCC. Moreover, governmental regulations and policies may change over time, and the changes may have a material adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee also \u201c-We face several risks regarding the foreign ownership issue.\u201d\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the FCC\u2019s media ownership rules, and any changes to such rules could restrict our ability to acquire broadcast stations.\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own (directly or by attribution) in any market and require FCC approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses. The FCC\u2019s media ownership rules remain in flux and subject to further agency and court proceedings. The FCC is required to review quadrennially the following media ownership rules and to modify, repeal or retain any rules as it determines to be in the public interest. In addition to the FCC media ownership rules, the outside media interests of our officers and directors could limit our ability to acquire stations. The filing of petitions or complaints against us or any of our license-holding subsidiaries, or any FCC licenses from which we are acquiring a station, could result in the FCC delaying the grant of, or refusing to grant or imposing conditions on, its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses. In addition, where proposed acquisitions might result in local radio\nadvertising revenue concentration, the DOJ and/or the FTC could undertake their own reviews and could attempt to block or place restrictions or conditions on such transactions.\nWe may be adversely affected by comprehensive tax reform.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Legislation was signed into law. The Tax Legislation contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, additional limitations on the tax deductibility of interest, substantial changes to the taxation of foreign earnings such as a tax on income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets (i.e., global intangible low-taxed income or \u201cGILTI\u201d), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nNew or changing federal, state or international privacy legislation or regulation could hinder the growth of our internet business.\nA variety of federal and state laws govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data that our internet business uses to operate its services and to deliver certain advertisements to its customers, as well as the technologies used to collect such data. For example, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act, we were required to make upgrades to our web-based and digital portals, including obtaining certain software licenses, to become compliant. Not only are existing privacy-related laws in these jurisdictions evolving and subject to potentially disparate interpretation by governmental entities, new legislative proposals affecting privacy are also now pending at both the federal and state level in the United States. Changes to the interpretation of existing law or the adoption of new privacy-related requirements could hinder the growth of our internet business. Also, a failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws or requirements or with our own policies and procedures could result in significant liabilities, including a possible loss of consumer or investor confidence or a loss of customers or advertisers.", "PERMNO": 87342, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "SBSAA"}
