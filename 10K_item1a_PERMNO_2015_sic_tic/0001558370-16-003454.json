{"cik": "1265131", "company": "Hilltop Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion sets forth what management currently believes could be the most significant regulatory, market and economic, liquidity, legal and business and operational risks and uncertainties that could impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to us, could also negatively impact our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Thus, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties we may face and the order of their respective significance may change.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the SWS Merger.\nAchieving the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of the SWS Merger and any other acquisitions we may complete will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired companies with our own in an efficient and effective manner. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the integration of certain operations will require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day business. Any inability to realize the full extent, or any, of the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of the SWS Merger or any other acquisitions we make, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and cause a decrease in our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and contribute to a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to cover actual loan losses, our banking segment earnings will be adversely affected.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that we could sustain losses because our borrowers may not repay their loans in accordance with the terms of their loans. We have historically accounted for this risk by maintaining an allowance for loan losses in an amount intended to cover Bank management\u2019s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Under the acquisition method of accounting requirements, we were required to estimate the fair value of the loan portfolios\nacquired in each of the PlainsCapital Merger, the FNB Transaction and the SWS Merger, respectively (collectively, the \u201cBank Transactions\u201d), as of the applicable acquisition date and write down the recorded value of such acquired portfolio to that estimate. For most loans, this process was accomplished by computing the net present value of estimated cash flows to be received from borrowers of these loans. The allowance for loan losses that had been maintained by PlainsCapital, FNB or SWS, as applicable, prior to their respective transactions, was eliminated in this accounting process. A new allowance for loan losses has been established for loans made by the Bank subsequent to consummation of the PlainsCapital Merger and for any decrease from that originally estimated as of the applicable acquisition date in the estimate of cash flows to be received from the loans acquired in the Bank Transactions.\nThe estimates of fair value as of the consummation of the Bank Transactions were based on economic conditions at such time and on Bank management\u2019s projections concerning both future economic conditions and the ability of the borrowers to continue to repay their loans. If management\u2019s assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect, however, the estimate of fair value may be higher than the actual fair value and we may suffer losses in excess of those estimated. Further, the allowance for loan losses established for new loans or for revised estimates may prove to be inadequate to cover actual losses, especially if economic conditions worsen.\nWhile management will endeavor to estimate the allowance to cover anticipated losses, no underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we could adopt to address credit risk could provide complete assurance that we will not incur unexpected losses. These losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, federal regulators periodically evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different from those of our Bank management. As a result, any such increase in our provision for loan losses or additional loan charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAn adverse change in real estate market values may result in losses in our banking segment and otherwise adversely affect our profitability.\nAt December 31, 2015, 42% of the loan portfolio of our banking segment was comprised of loans with real estate as the primary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides a source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A decline in real estate values generally, and in Texas specifically, could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amounts we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by a decrease in real estate market values.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by unpredictable economic, market and business conditions.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by general economic, market and business conditions. The credit quality of our loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in the areas in which we conduct our business. Our continued financial success depends to a degree on factors beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nnational and local economic conditions, such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, energy prices, bankruptcies, household income and consumer spending;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic consequences of international conditions, such as weakness in the European and Asian economies and emerging markets and the impact of that weakness on the U.S. and global economies;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and cost of capital and credit;\n\u00b7\nincidence of customer fraud; and\n\u00b7\nfederal, state and local laws affecting these matters.\nThe deterioration of any of these conditions, as we have experienced with past economic downturns, could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses and securities portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for\ncredit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, the investment portfolio of our insurance segment, our capital levels and liquidity, and our results of operations.\nAlthough the United States has recently seen improvement in certain economic indicators, including improvement in the housing market, increasing consumer confidence, continued growth in private sector employment, and improved credit availability, these improvements are relatively recent and may not be sustainable. Several factors could pose risks to the financial services industry, including low oil prices, political gridlock in Washington, D.C., regulatory uncertainty, continued infrastructure deterioration, and international political unrest. In addition, the current environment of heightened scrutiny of financial institutions has resulted in increased public awareness of and sensitivity to banking fees and practices. Each of these factors may adversely affect our fees and costs.\nOur geographic concentration may magnify the adverse effects and consequences of any regional or local economic downturn.\nWe conduct our banking operations primarily in Texas. At December 31, 2015, substantially all of the real estate loans in our loan portfolio were secured by properties located in our four largest markets within Texas, with 35.6%, 27.6%, 13.4% and 11.2% secured by properties located in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin/San Antonio, Rio Grande Valley/South Texas and Houston/Coastal Bend markets, respectively. Significantly all of these loans are made to borrowers who live and conduct business in Texas. Accordingly, economic conditions in Texas have a significant impact on the ability of the Bank\u2019s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure, and the stability of the Bank\u2019s deposit funding sources. Further, recent declines in crude oil prices may have a more profound effect on the economy of energy-dominant states such as Texas. At December 31, 2015, energy loans, including those within the exploration and production, oilfield services, pipeline construction, distribution and transportation sectors, comprised 3.6% of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio. The Bank also has loans extended to businesses that depend on the energy industry. If crude oil prices remain at low levels for an extended period, the Bank could experience weaker energy loan demand and increased losses within its energy and Texas-related loan portfolios.\nIn addition, mortgage origination fee income and insurance premium volume are both dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in Texas and California. During 2015, 22.2% and 14.7% by dollar volume of our mortgage loans originated were collateralized by properties located in Texas and California, respectively. Further, Texas insureds accounted for 70.5% and 69.3% of our insurance segment\u2019s gross premiums written in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects Texas or, to a lesser extent, California, whether caused by recession, inflation, unemployment, changing oil prices or other factors, may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors that are less geographically concentrated and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may suffer losses or be forced to make a \u201ctrue-up\u201d or reimbursement payment to the FDIC if our losses realized on the assets acquired in the FNB transaction are not covered by the loss-share agreements, the FDIC audits us and determines that we have not adequately managed these loans or we continue to experience favorable resolutions within our covered assets portfolio.\nUnder the terms of the loss-share agreements we entered into with the FDIC in connection with the FNB Transaction, the FDIC is obligated to reimburse us for the following amounts with respect to the covered assets (including covered loans): (i) 80% of net losses on the first $240.4 million of net losses incurred; (ii) 0% of net losses in excess of $240.4 million up to and including $365.7 million of net losses incurred; and (iii) 80% of net losses in excess of $365.7 million of net losses incurred. Net losses are defined as book value losses plus certain defined expenses incurred in the resolution of assets, less subsequent recoveries. Under the loss-share agreement for commercial assets, the amount of subsequent recoveries that are reimbursable to the FDIC for a particular asset is limited to book value losses and expenses actually billed plus any book value charge-offs incurred prior to September 13, 2013 (the \u201cBank Closing Date\u201d). There is no limit on the amount of subsequent recoveries reimbursable to the FDIC under the loss-share agreement for single family residential assets. The loss-share agreements for commercial and single family residential assets are in effect for 5 years and 10 years, respectively, and the loss recovery provisions to the FDIC are in effect for 8 years and 10 years, respectively, from the Bank Closing Date. Our obligations under the loss-share agreements are extensive, and failure to comply with any obligations could result in a specific asset, or group of assets, losing loss-share coverage. Although the FDIC has agreed to reimburse us for the substantial portion of losses on covered loans, the FDIC has the right to refuse or delay payment for loan losses if we do not manage covered loans in accordance with the loss-share agreements and may audit our past practices and require us to return amounts reimbursed to us if we are found to\nhave not managed the portfolio properly. In addition, reimbursable losses are based on the book value of the relevant assets as determined by the FDIC as of the effective dates of the transactions. The amount that we realize on these loans could differ materially from the carrying value that will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements, based upon the timing and amount of collections on the covered assets in future periods. In addition, certain losses projected to be incurred during the loss-share period may not be realized until after the expiration date of the applicable agreement and, consequently, would not be covered by the loss-share agreements. Any losses we experience in the assets acquired in the FNB Transaction that are not covered under the loss-share agreements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in accordance with the loss-share agreements, the Bank may be required to make a \u201ctrue-up\u201d payment to the FDIC approximately ten years following the Bank Closing Date if our actual net realized losses over the life of the loss-share agreements are less than the FDIC\u2019s initial estimate of losses on covered assets. The \u201ctrue-up\u201d payment is calculated using a defined formula set forth in the Purchase and Assumption Agreement we entered into with the FDIC in connection with the FNB Transaction. While the ultimate amount of any \u201ctrue-up\u201d payment is unknown at this time and will vary based upon the amount of future losses or recoveries within our covered loan portfolio, the Bank has recorded a related \u201ctrue-up\u201d payment accrual of $5.5 million at December 31, 2015 based on the current estimate of aggregate realized losses on covered assets over the life of the loss-share agreements. Additionally, as estimates of realized losses on covered assets change, the value of the receivable under the loss-share agreements with the FDIC (\u201cFDIC Indemnification Asset\u201d) will be adjusted and therefore may not be realized. If the Bank continues to experience favorable resolutions within its covered assets portfolio and covered losses are lower than currently estimated, the Bank may be required to increase its \u201ctrue-up\u201d payment accrual and recognize negative accretion (amortization) on the FDIC Indemnification Asset. These changes will be partially offset by increased discount accretion on the covered loan portfolio. If such changes occur, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur geographic concentration may also exacerbate the adverse effects on our insurance segment of inherently unpredictable catastrophic events.\nOur insurance segment expects to have large aggregate exposures to inherently unpredictable natural and man-made disasters of great severity, such as hurricanes, hail, tornados, windstorms, wildfires and acts of terrorism. Hurricanes Ike, Katrina and Rita highlighted the challenges inherent in predicting the impact of catastrophic events. The catastrophe models utilized by our insurance segment to assess its probable maximum insurance losses generally failed to adequately project the financial impact of these hurricanes. Although our insurance segment may attempt to exclude certain losses, such as terrorism and other similar risks, from some coverage that our insurance segment writes, it may be prohibited from, or may not be successful in, doing so. The occurrence of losses from catastrophic events may have a material adverse effect on our insurance segment\u2019s ability to write new business and on its financial condition and results of operations. Increases in the values and geographic concentrations of policyholder property and the effects of inflation have resulted in increased severity of industry losses in recent years, and our insurance segment expects that these factors will increase the severity of losses in the future. Factors that may influence our insurance segment\u2019s exposure to losses from these types of events, in addition to the routine adjustment of losses, include, among others:\n\u00b7\nexhaustion of reinsurance coverage;\n\u00b7\nincreases in reinsurance rates;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated litigation expenses;\n\u00b7\nunrecoverability of ceded losses;\n\u00b7\nimpact on independent agent operations and future premium income in areas affected by catastrophic events;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated expansion of policy coverage or reduction of premium due to regulatory, legislative and/or judicial action following a catastrophic event; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated demand surge related to other recent catastrophic events.\nOur insurance segment writes insurance primarily in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia and Louisiana. In 2015, Texas accounted for 70.5%, Arizona accounted for 9.6%, Oklahoma accounted for 6.6%, Tennessee accounted for 5.9% and Georgia accounted for 3.4% of our gross premiums written. As a result, a single catastrophe, destructive weather pattern, wildfire, terrorist attack, regulatory development or other condition or general economic trend affecting these regions or significant portions of these regions could adversely affect our insurance segment\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations more significantly than other insurance companies that conduct business across a broader geographic area. Although our insurance segment purchases catastrophe reinsurance to limit its exposure to these types of catastrophes, in the event of one or more major catastrophes resulting in losses to it in excess of $125.0 million, our insurance segment\u2019s losses would exceed the limits of its reinsurance coverage.\nOur risk management processes may not fully identify and mitigate exposure to the various risks that we face, including interest rate, credit, liquidity and market risk.\nWe continue to refine our risk management techniques, strategies and assessment methods on an ongoing basis. However, risk management techniques and strategies, both ours and those available to the market generally, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk. For example, we might fail to identify or anticipate particular risks, or the systems that we use, and that are used within our business segments generally, may not be capable of identifying certain risks. Certain of our strategies for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior. We apply statistical and other tools to these observations to quantify our risk exposure. Any failures in our risk management techniques and strategies to accurately identify and quantify our risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks. In addition, any risk management failures could cause our losses to be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. Further, our quantified modeling does not take all risks into account. As a result, we also take a qualitative approach in reducing our risk. Our qualitative approach to managing those risks could also prove insufficient, exposing us to material unanticipated losses.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings, capital levels and overall results.\nThe majority of our assets are monetary in nature and, as a result, we are subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may impact our net interest income in our banking segment as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities in each of our segments. Earnings in our banking segment are significantly dependent on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect to periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our banking segment\u2019s assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d may work against us, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nAn increase in the general level of interest rates may also, among other things, adversely affect the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans. In particular, if mortgage interest rates increase, the demand for residential mortgage loans and the refinancing of residential mortgage loans will likely decrease, which will have an adverse effect on our income generated from mortgage origination activities. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates may adversely affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume and our overall results.\nOur broker-dealer segment holds securities, principally fixed-income bonds, to support sales, underwriting and other customer activities. If interest rates increase, the value of debt securities held in the broker-dealer segment\u2019s inventory would decrease. Rapid or significant changes in interest rates could adversely affect the segment\u2019s bond sales, underwriting activities and broker-dealer businesses. Further, the profitability of our margin and stock lending businesses depends to a great extent on the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments of customer cash balances and the interest expense paid on customer cash balances and borrowings.\nOur insurance segment invested over 83% of its invested assets in fixed maturity assets such as bonds and mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2015. Because bond trading prices decrease as interest rates rise, a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our insurance segment\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. On the other hand, decreases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our insurance segment\u2019s investment income and results of operations. For example, if interest rates decline, investment of new premiums received and funds reinvested will earn less. Additionally, mortgage-backed securities typically are prepaid more quickly when interest rates fall and the holder must reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates. In periods of increasing interest rates, mortgage-backed securities typically are prepaid more slowly, which may require our insurance segment to receive interest payments that are below the then prevailing interest rates for longer time periods than expected. The volatility of\nour insurance segment\u2019s claims may force it to liquidate securities, which may cause it to incur capital losses. If our insurance segment\u2019s investment portfolio is not appropriately matched with its insurance liabilities, it may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover these liabilities. In addition, if we experience market disruption and volatility, such as that experienced in 2009 and 2010, we may experience additional losses on our investments and reductions in our earnings. Investment losses could significantly decrease the asset base and statutory surplus of our insurance segment, thereby adversely affecting its ability to conduct business and potentially its A.M. Best financial strength rating.\nIn addition, we hold securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in securities\u2019 prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, general liquidity needs and other similar factors are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value, which may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. The effects of an increase in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our available for sale investment portfolio.\nMarket interest rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. We may not be able to accurately predict the likelihood, nature and magnitude of such changes or how and to what extent such changes may affect our business. We also may not be able to adequately prepare for, or compensate for, the consequences of such changes. Any failure to predict and prepare for changes in interest rates, or adjust for the consequences of these changes, may adversely affect our earnings and capital levels and overall results of operations and financial condition.\nOur bank lending, margin lending, stock lending, securities trading and execution and mortgage purchase businesses are all subject to credit risk.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in all areas of our business. The Bank is exposed to the risk that its loan customers may not repay their loans in accordance with their terms, the collateral securing the loans may be insufficient, or its loan loss reserve may be inadequate to fully compensate the Bank for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. Our mortgage warehousing activities subject us to credit risk during the period between funding by the Bank and when the mortgage company sells the loan to a secondary investor.\nOur broker-dealer business is subject to credit risk if securities prices decline rapidly because the value of our collateral could fall below the amount of the indebtedness it secures. In rapidly appreciating markets, credit risk increases due to short positions. Our securities lending business as well as our securities trading and execution businesses subject us to credit risk if a counterparty fails to perform or if collateral securing its obligations is insufficient. In securities transactions, we are subject to credit risk during the period between the execution of a trade and the settlement by the customer.\nSignificant failures by our customers, including correspondents, or clients to honor their obligations, together with insufficient collateral and reserves, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are heavily dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries.\nWe are a financial holding company engaged in the business of managing, controlling and operating our subsidiaries, including the Bank and its subsidiary, PrimeLending, NLC and its two insurance company subsidiaries, NLIC and ASIC, and our Securities Holdings subsidiaries. We conduct no material business or other activity other than activities incidental to holding stock in the Bank, NLC and the Securities Holdings subsidiaries. As a result, we rely substantially on the profitability of, and dividends from, these subsidiaries to pay our operating expenses and to pay interest on our debt obligations. Each of the Bank, NLC and the Securities Holdings subsidiaries is subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends to us. Accordingly, if the Bank, NLC or the Securities Holdings subsidiaries are unable to make cash distributions to us, then we may be unable to satisfy our obligations or make interest payments on our debt obligations.\nNLIC and ASIC are also subject to limitations under debt agreements limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends, including the indenture governing NLC\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 3.40% notes due 2035 and the surplus indentures governing NLIC\u2019s two LIBOR plus 4.10% and 4.05% notes due 2033 and ASIC\u2019s LIBOR plus 4.05% notes due 2034.\nOur indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2015, on a consolidated basis, we had total deposits of $7.0 billion and other indebtedness of $1.3 billion, including $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. Our significant amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to compete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged, as we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions, developing properties or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nrestricting the way in which we conduct our business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 existing and future indebtedness, including, in the case of certain indebtedness of subsidiaries, certain covenants that restrict the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us;\n\u00b7\nexposing us to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or a decrease in pricing of our products; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to react to changing market conditions in our industry and in our customers\u2019 industries.\nIn addition to our debt service obligations, our operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.\nSubject to the restrictions in the indenture governing the Senior Notes, we may incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described above could increase.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:\n\u00b7\nour future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and\n\u00b7\nour future ability to refinance the Senior Notes, which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to obtain financing in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, including our obligations under the Senior Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants,\nwhich could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity and/or negotiate with our lenders and other creditors to restructure the applicable debt in order to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. The indenture governing the Senior Notes may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes contains, and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes contains, and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\ndispose of, or issue voting stock of, certain subsidiaries; or\n\u00b7\nincur or permit to exist any mortgage, pledge, encumbrance or lien or charge on the capital stock of certain subsidiaries.\nAny of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for, or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities. Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes offered hereby. Upon a default, holders of the Senior Notes offered hereby would have the ability ultimately to force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, subject to the indenture governing the Senior Notes. In addition, a default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes could trigger a cross default under the agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. Our operating results may not be sufficient to service our indebtedness or to fund our other expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing to meet these requirements.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision and regulation that could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business and limit our ability to generate income.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, including that of the Federal Reserve Board, the Texas Department of Banking, the Texas Department of Insurance, the FDIC, the CFPB, the SEC and FINRA. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not stockholders or other debt holders. Insurance regulations promulgated by state insurance departments are primarily intended to protect policyholders rather than stockholders or other debt holders. Likewise, regulations promulgated by FINRA are primarily intended to protect customers of broker-dealer businesses rather than stockholders or other debt holders.\nThese regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, capital requirements, investment practices, brokerage and investment advisory activities, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in money damages, civil money penalties or reputational damage, as well as sanctions and supervisory actions by regulatory agencies that could subject us to significant restrictions or suspensions on our business and our ability to expand through acquisitions or branching. Further, our clearing contracts generally include automatic termination provisions that are triggered in the event we are suspended from any of the national exchanges of which we are a member for failure to comply with the rules or regulations thereof. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations of laws and regulations, such violations may occur from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Congress and federal regulatory agencies frequently revise banking and securities laws, regulations and policies. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which significantly alters the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect that several aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act may affect our business, including, without limitation, increased capital requirements, increased mortgage regulation, restrictions on proprietary trading in securities, restrictions on investments in hedge funds and private equity funds, executive compensation restrictions, potential federal oversight of the insurance industry and disclosure and reporting requirements. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-\nFrank Act or the resulting rules and regulations will affect our business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations likely will result in additional costs, which could be significant and may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the Bank received a \u201csatisfactory\u201d CRA rating in connection with its most recent CRA performance evaluation. A CRA rating of less than \u201csatisfactory\u201d adversely affects a bank\u2019s ability to establish new branches and impairs a bank\u2019s ability to commence new activities that are \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d or acquire companies engaged in these activities. Other regulatory exam ratings or findings also may adversely impact our ability to branch, commence new activities or make acquisitions.\nWe cannot predict whether or in what form any other proposed regulations or statutes will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Such changes could subject our business to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nThe impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules are uncertain.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule that substantially amends the risk-based capital rules applicable to Hilltop and the Bank. The final rule implements the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective on a phase-in basis for Hilltop and the Bank on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios and results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. As of January 1, 2016, the new capital conservation buffer requirement is currently being phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. The application of more stringent capital requirements for Hilltop and the Bank could, among other things, adversely affect our results of operations and growth, require the raising of additional capital, restrict our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule in February 2014 that clarifies how companies should incorporate the Basel III regulatory capital reforms into their capital and business projections during the 2014 and subsequent cycles of capital plan submissions and stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act. For companies and their subsidiary banks with between $10.0 billion and $50.0 billion in total consolidated assets, the initial stress testing cycle began on October 1, 2013 and the initial nine-quarter planning horizon for stress capital projections continued through the fourth quarter of 2015, which overlaps with the implementation of the Basel III capital reforms that began on January 1, 2015. At December 31, 2015, Hilltop and the Bank had $11.9 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively, in total consolidated assets and their average of total consolidated assets for the four most recent consecutive quarters was $12.3 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. As a result of the SWS Merger, Hilltop has more than $10.0 billion in assets. Accordingly, Hilltop is currently subject to these capital planning and stress testing requirements, which will increase our cost of regulatory compliance. Compliance with these requirements may also necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with the annual stress testing requirements, part of which must be publicly disclosed, may also be misinterpreted by the market generally or our customers and, as a result, may adversely affect our stock price or our ability to retain our customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing program will require Hilltop to submit its initial annual company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve Board using our capital planning tools to regulators by July 31, 2017. Hilltop will be required to publicly disclose a summary of the results of these forward looking, company-run stress tests that assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline, adverse and severely adverse economic scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve Board. The stress testing and capital planning processes may, among other things, require us to limit any dividend or other capital distributions we may make to stockholders or increase our capital levels, modify our business and growth strategies or\ndecrease our exposure to various asset classes, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Management continues to study the implementation of Basel III regulatory capital reforms and stress testing requirements.\nIn July 2013 the SEC also adopted various amendments to Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act related to, among other things, securities lending, certain new deductions from net capital, proprietary accounts of broker-dealer customers, certain broker-dealer insolvency events and corresponding related amendments to books and records rules. The implementation of such requirements has increased and will likely continue to increase our cost of regulatory compliance.\nThe CFPB has issued \u201cability-to-repay\u201d and \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rules that may have a negative impact on our loan origination process and foreclosure proceedings, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOn January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule to implement the \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring mortgage lenders to consider consumers\u2019 ability to repay home loans before extending them credit. The CFPB\u2019s \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rule took effect on January 10, 2014. The final rule describes certain minimum requirements for lenders making ability-to-repay determinations, but does not dictate that they follow particular underwriting models. Lenders will be presumed to have complied with the ability-to-repay rule if they issue \u201cqualified mortgages,\u201d which are generally defined as mortgage loans prohibiting or limiting certain risky features. Loans that do not meet the ability-to-repay standard can be challenged in court by borrowers who default and the absence of ability-to-repay status can be used against a lender in foreclosure proceedings. Any loans that we make outside of the \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d criteria could expose us to an increased risk of liability and reduce or delay our ability to foreclose on the underlying property. The CFPB\u2019s \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rule could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive or time consuming to make these loans. Any decreases in loan origination volume or increases in compliance and foreclosure costs caused by the rule could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur broker-dealer business is subject to various risks associated with the securities industry.\nOur broker-dealer business is subject to uncertainties that are common in the securities industry. These uncertainties include:\n\u00b7\nintense competition in the public finance and other sectors of the securities industry;\n\u00b7\nthe volatility of domestic and international financial, bond and stock markets;\n\u00b7\nextensive governmental regulation;\n\u00b7\nlitigation; and\n\u00b7\nsubstantial fluctuations in the volume and price level of securities.\nAs a result, the revenues and operating results of our broker-dealer segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions could reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide financial advisory, underwriting and other services. Disruptions in fixed income and equity markets could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and, therefore, to declines in revenues from commissions and clearing services. Our broker-dealer business is much smaller and has much less capital than many competitors in the securities industry. In addition, the Hilltop Broker-Dealers are operating subsidiaries of Hilltop, which means that their activities are limited to those that are permissible for subsidiaries of a financial holding company.\nMarket fluctuations could adversely impact our broker-dealer business.\nOur broker-dealer segment is subject to risks as a result of fluctuations in the securities markets. Our securities trading, market-making and underwriting activities involve the purchase and sale of securities as a principal, which subjects our capital to significant risks. Market conditions could limit our ability to sell securities purchased or to purchase securities sold in such transactions. If price levels for equity securities decline generally, the market value of equity securities that we hold in our inventory could decrease and trading volumes could decline. In addition, if interest rates increase, the\nvalue of debt securities we hold in our inventory would decrease. Rapid or significant market fluctuations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, during periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain assets if comparable sales become less frequent or market data becomes less observable. Certain classes of assets or loan collateral that were in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, asset valuations may require more estimation and subjective judgment.\nOur investment advisory business may be affected if our investment products perform poorly.\nPoor investment returns and declines in client assets in our investment advisory business, due to either general market conditions or underperformance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by investment products, affects our ability to retain existing assets, prevent clients from transferring their assets out of products or their accounts, or inhibit our ability to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. Any such poor performance could adversely affect our investment advisory business and the advisory fees that we earn on client assets.\nOur portfolio trading business is highly price competitive and serves a very limited market.\nOur portfolio trading business serves one small component of the capital markets group with a small customer base and a high service model, charging competitive commission rates. Consequently, growing or maintaining market share is very price sensitive. We rely upon a high level of customer service and product customization to maintain our market share; however, should prevailing market prices fall, or the size of our market segment or customer base decline, our profitability would be adversely impacted. In addition, in our portfolio trading business, we purchase securities as principal, which subjects our capital to significant risks.\nOur existing correspondents may choose to perform their own clearing services, move their clearing business to one of our competitors or exit the business.\nAs our correspondents\u2019 operations grow, they often consider the option of performing clearing functions themselves, in a process referred to as \u201cself-clearing.\u201d The option to convert to self-clearing operations may be attractive due to the fact that as the transaction volume of a broker-dealer grows, the cost of implementing the necessary infrastructure for self-clearing may eventually be offset by the elimination of per transaction processing fees that would otherwise be paid to a clearing firm. Additionally, performing their own clearing services allows self-clearing broker-dealers to retain their customers\u2019 margin balances, free credit balances and securities for use in margin lending activities. Furthermore, our correspondents may decide to use the clearing services of one of our competitors or exit the business. Any significant loss of correspondents due to self-clearing or because of their use of a competitor\u2019s clearing service or their exiting the business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSeveral of our broker-dealer segment\u2019s product lines rely on favorable tax treatment and changes in federal tax law could impact the attractiveness of these products to our customers.\nWe offer a variety of services and products, such as individual retirement accounts and municipal bonds, which rely on favorable federal income tax treatment to be attractive to our customers. Should favorable tax treatment of these products be eliminated or reduced, sales of these products could be materially impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur mortgage origination segment is subject to investment risk on loans that it originates.\nWe intend to sell, and not hold for investment, substantially all residential mortgage loans that we originate through PrimeLending. At times, however, we may originate a loan or execute an interest rate lock commitment (\u201cIRLC\u201d) with a customer pursuant to which we agree to originate a mortgage loan on a future date at an agreed-upon interest rate without having identified a purchaser for such loan. An identified purchaser may also decline to purchase a loan for a variety of reasons. In these instances, we will bear interest rate risk on an IRLC until, and unless, we are able to find a buyer for the loan underlying such IRLC and the risk of investment on a loan until, and unless, we are able to find a buyer for such loan. In addition, if a customer defaults on a mortgage payment shortly after the loan is originated, the purchaser of the loan may have a put right, whereby the purchaser can require us to repurchase the loan at the full amount that it paid. During periods of market downturn, we have at times chosen to hold mortgage loans when the\nidentified purchasers have declined to purchase such loans because we could not obtain an acceptable substitute bid price for such loan. The failure of mortgage loans that we hold on our books to perform adequately could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates may change the value of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio which may increase the volatility of our earnings.\nWe have expanded, and may continue to expand, our residential mortgage servicing operations within our mortgage origination segment. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a portfolio of MSR assets. A MSR is the right to service a mortgage loan - collect principal, interest and escrow amounts - for a fee. We measure and carry all of our residential MSR assets using the fair value measurement method. Fair value is determined as the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers.\nOne of the principal risks associated with MSR assets is that in a declining interest rate environment, they will likely lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments. Moreover, if prepayments are greater than expected, the cash we receive over the life of the mortgage loans would be reduced. The mortgage origination segment uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and swaptions, as a means to mitigate market risk associated with MSR assets. However, no hedging strategy can protect us completely, and hedging strategies may fail because they are improperly designed, improperly executed and documented or based on inaccurate assumptions and, as a result, could actually increase our risks and losses. The increasing size of our MSR portfolio may increase our interest rate risk and correspondingly, the volatility of our earnings, especially if we cannot adequately hedge the interest rate risk relating to our MSR assets.\nAt December 31, 2015, the mortgage origination segment\u2019s MSR asset had a fair value of $53.5 million. All income related to retained servicing, including changes in the value of the MSR asset, is included in noninterest income. Depending on the interest rate environment, it is possible that the fair value of our MSR asset may be reduced in the future. If such changes in fair value significantly reduce the carrying value of our MSR asset, our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nIncome that we recognize in connection with the purchase discount of the credit-impaired loans acquired in the Bank Transactions and accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification 310-30 could be volatile in nature and have significant effects on reported net income.\nIn connection with the Bank Transactions, we acquired loans at an aggregate discount of $523.2 million. The Bank Transactions have each been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the respective discounts are amortized and accreted to interest income on a monthly basis. The effective yield and related discount accretion on credit-impaired loans is initially determined at the acquisition date based upon estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows as well as the amount of credit losses that will be incurred. These estimates are updated quarterly. In future periods, if actual historical results combined with future projections of these factors (amount, timing, or credit losses) differ from the initial projections, the effective yield and the amount of discount recognized will change. Volatility may increase as the variance of actual results from initial projections increases. As the acquired loans are removed from our books, the related discount will no longer be available for accretion into income. Aggregate accretion of $96.1 million on loans purchased at a discount in the Bank Transactions were recorded as interest income during 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of our discount on loans in the aggregate was $242.7 million.\nWe ultimately may write-off goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations.\nAs a result of purchase accounting in connection with our acquisition of NLC, the PlainsCapital Merger, the FNB Transaction and the SWS Merger, our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, contained goodwill of $251.8 million and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $54.9 million. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of value of intangible assets. As circumstances change, the value of these intangible assets may not be realized by us. If we determine that a material impairment has occurred, we will be required to write-off the impaired portion of intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if we are exposed to actual conditions different from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in this Annual Report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that are considered \u201ccritical\u201d by us because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, such events or assumptions could have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe are dependent on our management team, and the loss of our senior executive officers or other key employees could impair our relationship with customers and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur success is dependent, to a large degree, upon the continued service and skills of our existing management team and other key employees with long-term customer relationships. Our business and growth strategies are built primarily upon our ability to retain employees with experience and business relationships within their respective segments. The loss of one or more of these key personnel could have an adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel. In addition, we currently do not have non-competition agreements with certain members of management and other key employees. If any of these personnel were to leave and compete with us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth could suffer.\nA decline in the market for municipal advisory services could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur broker-dealer segment has historically earned a significant portion of its revenues from advisory fees paid to it by its clients, in large part upon the successful completion of the client\u2019s transaction. New issuances in the municipal market by cities, counties, school districts, state and other governmental agencies, airports, healthcare institutions, institutions of higher education and other clients that the public finance group serves can be subject to significant fluctuations based on by factors such as changes in interest rates, property tax bases, budget pressures on certain issuers caused by uncertain economic times and other factors. We expect that the reliance of our broker-dealer segment on advisory fees will continue for the foreseeable future, and a decline in public finance advisory engagements or the market for advisory services generally would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, credit unions, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even negative speculation about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry in general, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the receivable due us. Any such losses could be material and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNegative publicity regarding us, or financial institutions in general, could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and conduct our business could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is damaged. Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion regarding our company, or financial institutions in general, is inherent in our business. Adverse perceptions concerning our reputation could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. In particular, negative perceptions concerning our reputation could lead to decreases in the level of deposits that consumer\nand commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending or foreclosure practices; sales practices; corporate governance and potential conflicts of interest; ethical failures or fraud, including alleged deceptive or unfair lending or pricing practices; regulatory compliance; protection of customer information; cyber-attacks, whether actual, threatened, or perceived; negative news about us or the financial institutions industry generally; general company performance; or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to such activities or circumstances. Furthermore, our failure to address, or the perception that we have failed to address, these issues appropriately could impact our ability to keep and attract customers and/or employees and could expose us to litigation and/or regulatory action, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on our computer and communications systems and an interruption in service would negatively affect our business.\nOur businesses rely on electronic data processing and communications systems. The effective use of technology allows us to better serve customers and clients, increases efficiency and reduces costs. Our continued success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully maintain, secure and upgrade the capability of our systems, our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees. Significant malfunctions or failures of our computer systems, computer security, software or any other systems in the trading process (e.g., record retention and data processing functions performed by third parties, and third party software, such as Internet browsers) could cause delays in customer trading activity. Such delays could cause substantial losses for customers and could subject us to claims from customers for losses, including litigation claiming fraud or negligence. In addition, if our computer and communications systems fail to operate properly, regulations would restrict our ability to conduct business. Any such failure could prevent us from collecting funds relating to customer and client transactions, which would materially impact our cash flows. Any computer or communications system failure or decrease in computer system performance that causes interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively or timely implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operational systems and networks have been, and will continue to be, subject to an increasing risk of continually evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in a loss of customer business, financial liability, regulatory penalties, damage to our reputation or the disclosure of confidential information.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business and maintain the security of confidential information and complex transactions, which subjects us to an increasing risk of cyber incidents from these activities due to a combination of new technologies and the increasing use of the Internet to conduct financial transactions, as well as a potential failure, interruption or breach in the security of these systems, including those that could result from attacks or planned changes, upgrades and maintenance of these systems. Such cyber incidents could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, securities trading, general ledger, deposits, computer systems, electronic underwriting servicing or loan origination systems. We also utilize relationships with third parties to aid in a significant portion of our information systems, communications, data management and transaction processing to third parties. These third parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risks, including operational errors, system interruptions or breaches, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and misuse of intellectual property. If our third-party service providers encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, reputation damages, and litigation risk that could be material to our business.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and networks with measures such as intrusion detection and prevention systems and monitoring firewalls to safeguard critical business applications, there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can provide absolute security. Our computer systems, software and networks may be adversely affected by cyber incidents such as unauthorized access; loss or destruction of\ndata (including confidential client information); account takeovers; unavailability of service; computer viruses or other malicious code; cyber-attacks; and other events. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will promptly detect intrusions, and that we will not experience losses or incur costs or other damage related to intrusions that go undetected, at levels that adversely affect our financial results or reputation. These threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Additional challenges are posed by external extremist parties, including foreign state actors, in some circumstances, as a means to promote political ends. If one or more of these events occurs, it could result in the disclosure of confidential client or customer information, damage to our reputation with our clients, customers and the market, customer dissatisfaction, additional costs such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies, regulatory penalties, exposure to litigation and other financial losses to both us and our clients and customers. Such events could also cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our system.\nWe have been the subject of \u201cdenial of services\u201d attacks from external sources that have limited or interrupted the availability of our online banking services. Although to date we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, we may suffer such losses in the future. We have taken steps to improve and upgrade the security of our systems in response to such threats, but such incidents could occur again, more frequently or on a more significant scale.\nIn February 2014, FINRA released a report identifying principles and effective practices it expects firms to consider as they develop or enhance their cybersecurity programs, and in February 2015 and September 2015, the SEC\u2019s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations issued Risk Alerts to provide information on summary findings and areas of focus on cybersecurity examinations. In light of the guidance in these recent reports, Securities Holdings evaluated its cybersecurity program by participating in an Information Security vulnerability assessment based on the Critical Security Controls (CSCs) standard established by the Center for Internet Security. In addition to its standard external penetration testing, Securities Holdings expanded the scope of the external provider to include application, and authenticated internal testing.\nWe will continue to evaluate our cybersecurity program and will consider incorporating new practices as necessary to meet the expectations of such regulatory agencies. Such procedures include management-level engagement and corporate governance, risk management and assessment, technical controls, incident response planning, vendor management and staff training. Even if we implement these procedures, however, we cannot assure you that we will be fully protected from a cybersecurity incident, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nWe face strong competition from other financial institutions and financial service and insurance companies, which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur banking segment primarily competes with national, regional and community banks within various markets where the Bank operates. The Bank also faces competition from banks and many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies and credit unions. A number of these banks and other financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits, larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services than we do. We also compete with other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage and investment banking firms, consumer finance companies, pension trusts, insurance companies and governmental organizations, each of which may offer more favorable financing than we are able to provide. In addition, some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. The banking business in Texas has become increasingly competitive over the past several years, and we expect the level of competition we face to further increase. Competition for deposits and in providing lending products and services to consumers and businesses in our market area is intense and pricing is important. Other factors encountered in competing for savings deposits are convenient office locations, interest rates and fee structures of products offered. Direct competition for savings deposits also comes from other commercial bank and thrift institutions, money market mutual funds and corporate and government securities that may offer more attractive rates than insured depository institutions are willing to pay. Competition for loans is based on factors such as interest rates, loan origination fees and the range of services offered by the provider. We seek to distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our commitment to personalized customer service and responsiveness to customer needs while providing a range of competitive loan and deposit products and other services. Our profitability depends on our ability to compete effectively in these markets. This competition\nmay reduce or limit our margins on banking services, reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial advisory and investment banking industries also are intensely competitive industries and will likely remain competitive. Our broker-dealer business competes directly with numerous other financial advisory and investment banking firms, broker-dealers and banks, including large national and major regional firms and smaller niche companies, some of whom are not broker-dealers and, therefore, not subject to the broker-dealer regulatory framework. In addition to competition from firms currently in the industry, there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services, including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations. Our broker-dealer business competes on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of advice and service, technology, product selection, innovation, reputation client relationships and price. Many of our broker-dealer segment\u2019s competitors in the investment banking industry have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, more managing directors to serve their clients\u2019 needs, greater global reach and more established relationships with their customers than our broker-dealer business. Additionally, certain competitors of our financial advisory business have reorganized or plan to reorganize from investment banks into bank holding companies, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. These larger and better capitalized competitors may be more capable of responding to changes in the investment banking market, competing for skilled professionals, financing acquisitions, funding internal growth and competing for market share generally. Increased pressure created by any current or future competitors, or by competitors of our broker-dealer business collectively, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Increased competition may result in reduced revenue and loss of market share. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, our broker-dealer business may from time to time make certain pricing, service or marketing decisions that also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur mortgage origination business faces vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions, including large financial institutions as well as independent mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations. Our mortgage origination segment competes on a number of factors including customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates and loan origination fees. The ability to attract and retain skilled mortgage origination professionals is critical to our mortgage origination business. We seek to distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our commitment to personalized customer service and responsiveness to customer needs while providing a range of competitive mortgage loan products and services.\nThe insurance industry also is highly competitive and has, historically, been characterized by periods of significant price competition, alternating with periods of greater pricing discipline during which competitors focus on other factors, including service, experience, the strength of agent and policyholder relationships, reputation, speed and accuracy of claims payment, perceived financial strength, ratings, scope of business, commissions paid and policy and contract terms and conditions. Our insurance business competes with many other insurers, including large national companies that have greater financial, marketing and management resources than our insurance segment. Many of these competitors also have better ratings and market recognition than our insurance business.\nIn addition, a number of new, proposed or potential industry developments also could increase competition in our insurance segment\u2019s industry. These developments include changes in practices and other effects caused by the Internet (including direct marketing campaigns by our insurance segment\u2019s competitors in established and new geographic markets), which have led to greater competition in the insurance business and increased expectations for customer service. These developments could prevent our insurance business from expanding its book of business. Our insurance business also faces competition from new entrants into the insurance market. New entrants do not have historic claims or losses to address and, therefore, may be able to price policies on a basis that is not favorable to our insurance business. New competition could reduce the demand for our insurance segment\u2019s insurance products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage origination and insurance businesses are subject to fluctuations based upon seasonal and other factors and, as a result, our results of operations for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nOur mortgage origination business is subject to several variables that can impact loan origination volume, including seasonal and interest rate fluctuations. We typically experience increased loan origination volume from purchases of homes during the second and third calendar quarters, when more people tend to move and buy or sell homes. In addition,\nan increase in the general level of interest rates may, among other things, adversely affect the demand for mortgage loans and our ability to originate mortgage loans. In particular, if mortgage interest rates increase, the demand for residential mortgage loans and the refinancing of residential mortgage loans will likely decrease, which will have an adverse effect on our mortgage origination activities. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to increased competition for mortgage loan origination business. As a result of these variables, our results of operations for any single quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nGenerally, our insurance segment\u2019s insured risks exhibit higher losses in the second and third calendar quarters due to a seasonal concentration of weather-related events in its primary geographic markets. Although weather-related losses (including hail, high winds, tornadoes and hurricanes) can occur in any calendar quarter, the second calendar quarter, historically, has experienced the highest frequency of losses associated with these events. Hurricanes, however, are more likely to occur in the third calendar quarter of the year.\nIf the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses of our insurance segment exceed its loss and expense estimates, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of our insurance segment depend upon its ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks that it insures. Our insurance segment establishes reserve liabilities to cover the payment of all losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cLAE\u201d) incurred under the policies that it writes. These liability estimates include case estimates, which are established for specific claims that have been reported to our insurance segment, and liabilities for claims that have been incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d). LAE represent expenses incurred to investigate and settle claims. To the extent that losses and LAE exceed estimates, NLIC and ASIC will be required to increase their reserve liabilities and reduce their income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. In addition, increasing reserves causes a reduction in policyholders\u2019 surplus and could cause a downgrade in the ratings of NLIC and ASIC. This, in turn, could diminish our ability to sell insurance policies.\nThe liability estimation process for our insurance segment\u2019s casualty insurance coverage possesses characteristics that make case and IBNR reserving inherently less susceptible to accurate actuarial estimation than is the case with property coverages. Unlike property losses, casualty losses are claims made by third-parties of which the policyholder may not be aware and, therefore, may be reported a significant time after the occurrence, including sometimes years later. As casualty claims most often involve claims of bodily injury, assessment of the proper case estimates is a far more subjective process than claims involving property damage. In addition, in determining the case estimate for a casualty claim, information develops slowly over the life of the claim and can subject the case estimation to substantial modification well after the claim was first reported. Numerous factors impact the casualty case reserving process, such as venue, the amount of monetary damage, legislative activity, the permanence of the injury and the age of the claimant.\nThe effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims from catastrophes or other events to rise in the future. Increases in the values and geographic concentrations of policyholder property and the effects of inflation have resulted in increased severity of industry losses in recent years, and our insurance segment expects that these factors will increase the severity of losses in the future. As NLC observed in 2008, the severity of some catastrophic weather events, including the scope and extent of damage and the inability to gain access to damaged properties, and the ensuing shortages of labor and materials and resulting demand surge, provide additional challenges to estimating ultimate losses. Our insurance segment\u2019s liabilities for losses and LAE include assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above liabilities established for these costs, our insurance segment expects to be required to increase its liabilities, together with a corresponding reduction in its net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified.\nEstimating an appropriate level of liabilities for losses and LAE is an inherently uncertain process. Accordingly, actual loss and LAE paid will likely deviate, perhaps substantially, from the liability estimates reflected in our insurance segment\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Claims could exceed our insurance segment\u2019s estimate for liabilities for losses and LAE, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our insurance segment cannot obtain adequate reinsurance protection for the risks it underwrites or its reinsurers do not pay losses in a timely fashion, or at all, our insurance segment will suffer greater losses from these risks or may reduce the amount of business it underwrites, which may materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance segment purchases reinsurance to protect itself from certain risks and to share certain risks it underwrites. During 2015 and 2014, our insurance segment\u2019s personal lines ceded 6.7% and 10.0%, respectively, of its direct insurance premiums written (primarily through excess of loss, quota share and catastrophe reinsurance treaties) and its commercial lines ceded 4.2% and 5.6%, respectively, of its direct insurance premiums written (primarily through excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties). The total cost of reinsurance, inclusive of per risk excess and catastrophe, decreased 3.2% during 2015, which is partially attributable to reduced limits, lower premium rates and slightly higher reinstatement premiums in 2015 of $37 thousand. Reinsurance cost generally fluctuates as a result of storm costs or any changes in capacity within the reinsurance market.\nFrom time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, insurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they have considered adequate for their business needs. Accordingly, our insurance segment may not be able to obtain desired amounts of reinsurance. Even if our insurance segment is able to obtain adequate reinsurance, it may not be able to obtain it from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness or negotiate terms that it deems appropriate or acceptable. Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in our insurance segment\u2019s premium rates, our insurance segment may have guaranteed certain premium rates to its policyholders. Under these circumstances, if the cost of reinsurance were to increase with respect to policies for which our insurance segment guaranteed the rates, our insurance segment would be adversely affected. In addition, if our insurance segment cannot obtain adequate reinsurance protection for the risks it underwrites, it may be exposed to greater losses from these risks or it may be forced to reduce the amount of business that it underwrites for such risks, which will reduce our insurance segment\u2019s revenue and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2015, our insurance segment had $16.9 million in reinsurance recoverables, including ceded paid loss recoverables, ceded losses and LAE recoverables and ceded unearned insurance premiums. Our insurance segment expects to continue to purchase substantial reinsurance coverage in the foreseeable future. Because our insurance segment remains primarily liable to its policyholders for the payment of their claims, regardless of the reinsurance it has purchased relating to those claims, in the event that one of its reinsurers becomes insolvent or otherwise refuses to reimburse our insurance segment for losses paid, or delays in reimbursing our insurance segment for losses paid, its liability for these claims could materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal claims and litigation, including potential securities law liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face significant legal risks in each of the business segments in which we operate, and the volume of legal claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial service companies remains high. These risks often are difficult to assess or quantify, and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us or any of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business and prospects. Further, regulatory inquiries and subpoenas, other requests for information, or testimony in connection with litigation may require incurrence of significant expenses, including fees for legal representation and fees associated with document production. These costs may be incurred even if we are not a target of the inquiry or a party to the litigation. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, in the normal course of business, our broker-dealer segment has been subject to claims by customers and clients alleging unauthorized trading, churning, mismanagement, suitability of investments, breach of fiduciary duty or other alleged misconduct by our employees or brokers. We are sometimes brought into lawsuits based on allegations concerning our correspondents. As underwriters, we are subject to substantial potential liability for material misstatements and omissions in prospectuses and other communications with respect to underwritten offerings of securities. Prolonged litigation producing significant legal expenses or a substantial settlement or adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the foreclosure on real estate assets securing the loan portfolio of our banking segment.\nHazardous or toxic substances or other environmental hazards may be located on the real estate that secures our loans. If we acquire such properties as a result of foreclosure, or otherwise, we could become subject to various environmental liabilities. For example, we could be held liable for the cost of cleaning up or otherwise addressing contamination at or from these properties. We could also be held liable to a governmental entity or third party for property damage, personal injury or other claims relating to any environmental contamination at or from these properties. In addition, we could be held liable for costs relating to environmental contamination at or from our current or former properties. We may not detect all environmental hazards associated with these properties. If we ever became subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide timely and reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, our financial statements may not accurately reflect our financial condition. Inadequate internal controls over financial reporting could impact the reliability and timeliness of our financial reports and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on our business and the value of our securities.\nThe debt agreements of our insurance segment and its controlled affiliates contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on its business.\nThe indenture governing NLC\u2019s LIBOR plus 3.40% notes due 2035 contains restrictions on its ability to, among other things, declare and pay dividends and merge or consolidate. In addition, this indenture contains a change of control provision, which provides that (i) if a person or group becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of NLC\u2019s equity securities and (ii) if NLC\u2019s ratings are downgraded by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined in the Exchange Act), then each holder of the notes governed by such indenture has the right to require that NLC purchase such holder\u2019s notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the then outstanding principal amount. Likewise, the surplus indentures governing NLIC\u2019s two LIBOR plus 4.10% and 4.05% notes due 2033 and ASIC\u2019s LIBOR plus 4.05% notes due 2034 contain restrictions on dividends and mergers and consolidations. In addition, NLC has other credit arrangements with its affiliates and other third-parties.\nNLC\u2019s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default under the loan agreements or indentures governing the notes or under its other debt agreements. An event of default under its debt agreements would permit some of its lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If NLC were unable to repay debt to its secured lenders, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of its other indebtedness may cause NLC to be unable to make interest payments on the notes. Other agreements that NLC or its insurance company subsidiaries may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on their respective businesses that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under their respective existing agreements. These restrictions may affect NLC\u2019s ability to operate its business and may limit its ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nRisks Related to our Substantial Cash Position and Related Strategies for its Use\nBecause we intend to use a substantial portion of our remaining available cash to make acquisitions or effect a business combination, we may become subject to risks inherent in pursuing and completing any such acquisitions or business combination.\nWe are endeavoring to make acquisitions or effect business combinations with a substantial portion of our remaining available cash. We may not, however, be able to identify suitable targets, consummate acquisitions or effect a combination on commercially acceptable terms or, if consummated, successfully integrate personnel and operations.\nThe success of any acquisition or business combination will depend upon, among other things, the ability of management and our employees to integrate personnel, operations, products and technologies effectively, to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and to retain customers and clients of targets. In addition, any acquisition or business\ncombination we undertake may consume available cash resources, result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business that we acquire or with which we merge, our diligence may not surface all material issues that may adversely affect a particular target business, and we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Consequently, we also may need to make further investments to support the acquired or combined company and may have difficulty identifying and acquiring the appropriate resources.\nWe may enter, through acquisitions or a business combination, into new lines of business or initiate new service offerings subject to the restrictions imposed upon us as a regulated financial holding company. Accordingly, there is no basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular target business with which we may combine or that we may ultimately acquire.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected the yield on our available cash.\nOur primary objective is to preserve and maintain the liquidity of our available cash, while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for a prolonged period. This volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels, resulting in dramatic declines in interest rates and other yields relative to risk. This downward pressure has negatively affected the yields we receive on our available cash. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will receive any significant yield on our available cash. Further, given current market conditions, no assurance can be given that we will be able to preserve our available cash.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock or additional shares of common stock to complete an acquisition or effect a combination or under an employee incentive plan after consummation of an acquisition or combination, which would dilute the interests of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock or additional shares of common stock:\n\u00b7\nmay significantly dilute the equity interest of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;\n\u00b7\ncould cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards; and\n\u00b7\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nOur authorized capital stock includes ten million shares of preferred stock, all of which is unissued. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may designate and issue one or more additional series of preferred stock from the authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by law or our articles of incorporation, our board of directors is empowered to determine the designation and number of shares constituting each series of preferred stock, as well as any designations, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions or special or relative rights of additional series. The rights of preferred stockholders may supersede the rights of common stockholders. Preferred stock could be issued with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the shares of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could also result in a series of securities outstanding that would have preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends and in liquidation.\nOur common stock price may experience substantial volatility, which may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price.\nPrice volatility of our common stock may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price. Market price fluctuations in our common stock may arise due to acquisitions, dispositions or other material public announcements, including those regarding dividends or changes in management, along with a variety of additional factors, including, without limitation, other risks identified in \u201cForward-looking Statements\u201d and these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d In addition, the stock markets in general, including the NYSE, have experienced extreme price and trading fluctuations.\nThese fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nExisting circumstances may result in several of our directors having interests that may conflict with our interests.\nA director who has a conflict of interest with respect to an issue presented to our board will have no inherent legal obligation to abstain from voting upon that issue. We do not have provisions in our bylaws or charter that require an interested director to abstain from voting upon an issue, and we do not expect to add provisions in our charter and bylaws to this effect. Although each director has a duty to act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests, there is a risk that, should interested directors vote upon an issue in which they or one of their affiliates has an interest, their vote may reflect a bias that could be contrary to our best interests. In addition, even if an interested director abstains from voting, the director\u2019s participation in the meeting and discussion of an issue in which they have, or companies with which they are associated have, an interest could influence the votes of other directors regarding the issue.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.\nWe are organized under Maryland law, which provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter eliminates our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability to us and our stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and that is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, our stockholders and we may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAuthority to Issue Additional Shares. Under our charter, our board of directors may issue up to an aggregate of ten million shares of preferred stock without stockholder action. The preferred stock may be issued, in one or more series, with the preferences and other terms designated by our board of directors that may delay or prevent a change in control of us, even if the change is in the best interests of stockholders. At December 31, 2015, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.\nBanking Laws. Any change in control of our company is subject to prior regulatory approval under the Bank Holding Company Act or the Change in Bank Control Act, which may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of us.\nInsurance Laws. NLIC and ASIC are domiciled in the State of Texas. Before a person can acquire control of an insurance company domiciled in Texas, prior written approval must be obtained from the Texas Department of Insurance. Acquisition of control would be presumed on the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the regulators determine otherwise. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the Texas Department of Insurance will consider several factors, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe financial strength of the acquirer;\n\u00b7\nthe integrity and management experience of the acquirer\u2019s board of directors and executive officers;\n\u00b7\nthe acquirer\u2019s plans for the management of the insurer;\n\u00b7\nthe acquirer\u2019s plans to declare dividends, sell assets or incur debt;\n\u00b7\nthe acquirer\u2019s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of the acquisition on continued licensure of the domestic insurer;\n\u00b7\nthe impact on the interests of Texas policyholders; and\n\u00b7\nany anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control.\nThese laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals for us and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, including transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider desirable.\nFINRA. Any change in control (as defined under FINRA rules) of any of the Hilltop Broker-Dealers, including through acquisition, is subject to prior regulatory approval by FINRA which may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or other change in control of such broker-dealers.\nRestrictions on Calling Special Meeting, Cumulative Voting and Director Removal. Our bylaws includes a provision prohibiting the holders of less than a majority of the voting power represented by all of our shares issued, outstanding and entitled to be voted at a proposed meeting, from calling a special meeting of stockholders. Our charter does not provide for the cumulative voting in the election of directors. In addition, our charter provides that our directors may only be removed for cause and then only by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Any amendment to our charter relating to the removal of directors requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. These provisions of our bylaws and charter may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of us.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC, SIPC, the Texas Department of Insurance or any other government agency. Accordingly, you should be capable of affording the loss of any investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90037, "SIC": 6199, "TIC": "HTH"}
