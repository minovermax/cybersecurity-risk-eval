RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. Our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of the following risks. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the value and trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe have generated no revenue from commercial sales to date and our future profitability is uncertain.\nWe were incorporated in May 2017 and have a limited operating history and our business is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with development and expansion of a new business enterprise. Since inception, we have incurred losses and expect to continue to operate at a net loss for at least the next several years as we commence our research and development efforts, conduct clinical trials and develop manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $14,313,705 and $7,197,816, respectively, and our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $33,727,163 and $19,413,458, respectively. There can be no assurance that the products under development by us will be approved for sale in the U.S. or elsewhere. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that if such products are approved they will be successfully commercialized, and the extent of our future losses and the timing of our profitability are highly uncertain. If we are unable to achieve profitability, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue or complete our product development and you will likely lose your entire investment.\nWe will need to continue to seek capital from time to time to continue development of our product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that any revenues that we may generate in the future will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations. We believe that we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur business or operations may change in a manner that may consume available funds more rapidly than anticipated and substantial additional funding may be required to maintain operations, fund expansion, commercialize our product candidates, develop new or enhanced products, acquire complementary products, business or technologies or otherwise respond to competitive pressures and opportunities, such as a change in the regulatory environment or a change in preferred treatment modalities. In addition, we may need to accelerate the growth of our sales capabilities and distribution beyond what is currently envisioned, and this would require additional capital. However, we may not be able to secure funding on favorable terms, if at all.\nIf we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale back or eliminate our research and development activities, clinical studies or operations. We may also be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators, which arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain intellectual property, technologies or products that we otherwise would not consider relinquishing, including rights to future product candidates or certain major geographic markets. This could result in sharing revenues which we might otherwise retain for ourselves. Any of these actions may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including the progress, timing and scope of our product development programs; the progress, timing and scope of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals; the time and cost necessary to further develop manufacturing processes and arrange for contract manufacturing; our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships; and our partners\u2019 commitment of time and resources to the development and commercialization of our products.\nEven if we can raise additional funding, we may be required to do so on terms that are dilutive to you.\nThe capital markets have been unpredictable in the recent past for unprofitable companies such as ours. The amount of capital that a company such as ours is able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, or at all. If we are able to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet our future needs. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, including our results of operations, financial condition and our continued viability will be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval, Manufacturing and Commercialization\nWe are dependent upon the clinical success of our licensed products and technologies. If we are unable to generate revenues from our licensed products and technologies, our ability to create shareholder value may be limited.\nWe do not currently generate revenues from any of our product candidates, and we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence our clinical trials. If we do not obtain such approvals, the time in which we expect to commence clinical programs for our product candidates will be extended and such extension may increase our expenses and our need for additional capital. Moreover, there is no guarantee that our clinical trials will be successful or that we will continue clinical development in support of an approval from the regulatory agencies for any indication. We note that most drug candidates never reach the clinical stage and even those that do commence clinical development have only a small chance of successfully completing clinical development and gaining regulatory approval. Therefore, our business currently depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, which may never occur.\nAlthough we have entered into the Voltron Agreement pursuant to which we and HaloVax intend to jointly develop products to prevent COVID-19, no assurance can be given as to when, if ever, we will be able to develop any products for such purpose and if developed that such products will be successfully commercialized.\nIn March 2020, we entered into the Voltron Agreement pursuant to which we and HaloVax will work to jointly develop potential products candidates to prevent COVID-19; however, no assurance can be given as to when, if ever, we will be able to develop any products for such purpose. Furthermore, we are subject to risks including, but not limited to, the following with respect to the development of a treatment for COVID-19:\n\u25cf the Emergency Use Authorization marketing approval processes of the FDA are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have a marketable product;\n\u25cf we may encounter substantial delays in completing our clinical studies which in turn will require additional costs, or we may fail to demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf conducting successful clinical studies may require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit;\n\u25cf to be commercially successful, physicians must be persuaded that using our products are effective alternatives to other existing therapies and treatments;\n\u25cf we may depend on third parties for manufacturing our proposed product candidates and any conflicts with such partners could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of such product candidates;\n\u25cf if third-party contract manufacturers upon whom we rely to formulate and manufacture our product candidates do not perform, fail to manufacture according to our specifications or fail to comply with strict regulations, our clinical studies could be adversely affected and the development of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated or we could incur significant additional expenses;\n\u25cf adverse events involving our products may lead the FDA to delay or deny clearance for our products or result in product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results; and\n\u25cf if we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial enforcement actions, including civil and criminal penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf our joint venture with HaloVax, LLC (\u201cHaloVax\u201d) is not successful or if we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from such joint venture, we may not be able to capitalize on the full market potential of our potential products.\nIn March 2020, we entered into the Voltron Agreement to form a joint venture entity named HaloVax to jointly develop potential product candidates for the prevention of the COVID-19. Pursuant to the terms of the Voltron Agreement we are entitled to receive sales-based royalties at low single digit percentages. In addition, in 2020, we purchased 6% of HaloVax\u2019s outstanding membership interests and shall contribute proceeds of the development of products to prevent COVID-19. If and to the extent we and HaloVax are unable to develop potential product candidates for the prevention of COVID-19, we will not be entitled to any sale-based royalties and the value of our ownership interest in HaloVax could decline in which case we may lose all or part of our investment in HaloVax.\nWhile Voltron has agreed to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to exchange information and resources that will lead to the development activities and established a Joint Development Committee consisting of seven members, two of which were selected by us, to plan, review, coordinate and oversee the performance of the development activities and timelines with respect to development activities, we have limited contractual rights to direct its activities. Moreover, we will not have any other control with respect to the operations of HaloVax. Therefore, HaloVax will have a greater influence with respect to its commercialization efforts and other operations. In general, our joint venture with HaloVax subjects us to a number of related risks including that:\n\u25cf we may not receive sales-based royalties pursuant to the terms of the Voltron Agreement;\n\u25cf we may not be successful in the development of any product candidates;\n\u25cf HaloVax may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our products;\n\u25cf HaloVax may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and other potential liability;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between us and HaloVax that result in the delay or termination of the commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources including, but not limited to, disputes with respect to commercializing products upon terms mutually agreeable or beneficial to us and HaloVax;\n\u25cf any products, if developed, will be sold or licensed on terms that are beneficial to us;\n\u25cf HaloVax may not provide us with timely and accurate information regarding commercialization status or results, which could adversely impact our ability to manage our own commercialization efforts, accurately forecast financial results or provide timely information to our shareholders regarding our commercialization efforts; and\n\u25cf if any product candidates are successfully developed that we will be able to commercialize such products upon terms mutually agreeable or beneficial to us and HaloVax.\nIf HT-005 is not commercialized by Zyl\u00f6 or otherwise acquired by a third party, we may not be able to capitalize on the full market potential of our interests with respect to HT-005.\nIn December 2021, we licensed HT-005 back to Zyl\u00f6 and are entitled to receive a low single digit percent of the net proceeds attributable to the sale of HT-005 to a third party, a low single digit percent of the net proceeds from the sale of HT-005 in the United States and Canada and their respective territories (collectively, the \u201cTerritory\u201d) and a low double digit percent of any royalty Zyl\u00f6 receives through the sublicense to a third party based on the net sales of HT-005 in the Territory. In connection with the license of HT-005 back to Zyl\u00f6, we acquired 100,000 shares of Zyl\u00f6\u2019s Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we own 220,000 shares of Zyl\u00f6\u2019s Class B common stock. If Zyl\u00f6 is unable to sell or otherwise commercialize HT-005, we will not be entitled to any proceeds or sale-based royalties and the value of our ownership interest in Zyl\u00f6 could decline in which case we may lose all or part of our investment in Zyl\u00f6.\nThe marketing approval process of the FDA is lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates we intend to develop, our business may be substantially harmed.\nNone of the product candidates we intend to develop have gained marketing authorization, approval or clearance in the U.S. or elsewhere, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. Our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize our product candidates in the United States or elsewhere without first obtaining approval from regulatory agencies such as the FDA to market each product candidate. Our product candidates could fail to receive marketing approval for many reasons, including among others:\n\u25cf the FDA or other regulatory agencies may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA could determine that we cannot rely on Section 505(b)(2) for any of our product candidates; and\n\u25cf the FDA may determine that we have identified the wrong reference listed drug or drugs or that approval of our Section 505(b)(2) application for any of our product candidates is blocked by patent or non-patent exclusivity of the reference listed drug or drugs.\nIn addition, the process of seeking regulatory clearance or approval to market the product candidates we intend to develop is expensive and time consuming and, notwithstanding the effort and expense incurred, clearance or approval is never guaranteed. If we are not successful in obtaining timely clearance or approval of our product candidates from the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, we may never be able to generate significant revenue and may be forced to cease operations. The NDA process is costly, lengthy and uncertain. Any NDA application filed by us will have to be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use.\nObtaining clearances or approvals from the FDA and from regulatory agencies in other countries is an expensive and time-consuming process and is uncertain as to outcome. The FDA and other agencies could ask us to supplement our submissions, collect non-clinical data, conduct additional clinical trials or engage in other time-consuming actions, or it could simply deny our applications. In addition, even if we obtain an NDA approval or pre-market approvals in other countries, the approval could be revoked or other restrictions imposed if post-market data demonstrates safety issues or lack of effectiveness. We cannot predict with certainty how, or when, the FDA or other regulatory agencies will act. If we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, our financial condition and cash flow may be adversely affected, and our ability to grow domestically and internationally may be limited. Additionally, even if cleared or approved, our products may not be approved for the specific indications that are most necessary or desirable for successful commercialization or profitability.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in completing our clinical studies which in turn will require additional costs, or we may fail to demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nIt is impossible to predict if or when any of our product candidates will prove safe or effective in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u25cf delays in reaching, or failing to reach, a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;\n\u25cf delays in reaching, or failing to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with a sufficient number of prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining required IRB or Ethics Committee (\u201cEC\u201d) approval at each clinical study site;\n\u25cf delays in recruiting a sufficient number of suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies;\n\u25cf imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies, after an inspection of our clinical study operations or study sites;\n\u25cf failure by our CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical study, regulatory or legal requirements;\n\u25cf failure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s GCP or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u25cf delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of sufficient quantities of our product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u25cf delays in having patients complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf clinical study sites or patients dropping out of a study;\n\u25cf delay or failure to address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs or increases in costs of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u25cf occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; or\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs or ECs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board for such trial or by the FDA, Therapeutics Goods Administration (\u201cTGA\u201d), European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d), or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA, TGA, or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nAny inability to successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions.\nClinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe outcome of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Further, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval. If the results of our clinical studies are inconclusive or if there are safety concerns or adverse events associated with our other product candidates, we may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates, if approved at all;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u25cf be required to change the way the product is administered;\n\u25cf be required to perform additional clinical studies to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u25cf have regulatory authorities withdraw their approval of a product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u25cf be sued; or\n\u25cf experience damage to our reputation.\nAdditionally, our product candidates could potentially cause other adverse events that have not yet been predicted. The inclusion of ill patients in our clinical studies may result in deaths or other adverse medical events due to other therapies or medications that such patients may be using. As described above, any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates and impair our ability to commercialize our products.\nIf we are not able to obtain any required regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be limited.\nWe must successfully complete clinical trials for our product candidates before we can apply for marketing approval. Even if we complete our clinical trials, it does not assure marketing approval. Our pre-clinical trials may be unsuccessful, which would materially harm our business. Even if our initial pre-clinical trials are successful, we are required to conduct clinical trials to establish our product candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy, before a marketing application (NDA or BLA or their foreign equivalents) can be filed with the FDA, the EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval of our product candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in early phases of pre-clinical and clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, EMA, and other regulatory authorities in the United States, European Union, and other countries, where regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates as prescription pharmaceutical products in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA is approved. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA or other regulatory authorities and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. We have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities. If our development efforts for our product candidates, including regulatory approval, are not successful for their planned indications, or if adequate demand for our product candidates is not generated, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on the receipt of regulatory approval and the issuance of such regulatory approvals is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf the results of nonclinical or toxicology studies may not support the filing of an IND or foreign equivalent for our product candidates;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or IRBs or ECs may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of our product candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials may not be satisfactory or may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA, EMA, or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval;\n\u25cf the dosing of our product candidates in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u25cf patients in our clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, BLA or other marketing application or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the requirement for additional studies;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree on the design or implementation of our clinical trials, including the methodology used in our studies, our chosen endpoints, our statistical analysis, or our proposed product indication;\n\u25cf our failure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA, or comparable regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf we may fail to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf immunogenicity might affect a product candidate\u2019s efficacy and/or safety;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient to support the submission and filing of a marketing application or to obtain marketing approval. For example, the FDA may require additional studies to show that our product candidates are safe or effective;\n\u25cf we may fail to obtain approval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf there may be changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our nonclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval; or\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional nonclinical or clinical data to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates for the foregoing, or any other reasons, will prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. We cannot guarantee that regulators will agree with our assessment of the results of the clinical trials we intend to conduct in the future or that such trials will be successful. The FDA, EMA and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional clinical trials, or pre-clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on consultants and third party CROs with expertise in this area to assist us in this process. Securing regulatory approvals to market a product requires the submission of pre-clinical, clinical, and/or pharmacokinetic data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the appropriate regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish a product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for each indication. Our product candidates may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude us from obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use with respect to one or all intended indications.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, the jurisdiction in which regulatory approval is sought and the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which we may seek approval, but the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to seek approval in a different jurisdiction. Failure to obtain regulatory marketing approval for our product candidates in any indication will prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nIf we are unable to submit an application for product candidate approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or if we are required to generate additional data related to the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.\nWe may seek marketing authorization in the United States under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA which permits use of a marketing application, referred to as a 505(b)(2) application, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use. The FDA interprets this to mean that an applicant may rely for approval on such data as that found in published literature or the FDA\u2019s finding of safety or effectiveness, or both, of a previously approved drug product owned by a third party. There is no assurance that the FDA would find third-party data relied upon by us in a 505(b)(2) application sufficient or adequate to support approval and may require us to generate additional data to support the safety and efficacy of a product candidate. Consequently, we may need to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to conduct. Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming and there is no assurance that such data generated from such additional activities would be sufficient to obtain approval.\nIf the data to be relied upon in a 505(b)(2) application is related to drug products previously approved by the FDA and covered by patents that are listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book, we would be required to submit with our 505(b)(2) application a Paragraph IV Certification in which we must certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, and provide notice to the patent owner or the holder of the approved NDA. The patent owner or NDA holder would have 45 days from receipt of the notification of our Paragraph IV Certification to initiate a patent infringement action against us. If an infringement action is initiated, the approval of our NDA would be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit. Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates. Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient clinical data so that we would no longer need to rely on third-party data, which would be costly and time consuming and there would be no assurance that such data generated from such additional activities would be sufficient to obtain approval.\nWe may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications, and the FDA may not agree that a product candidate qualifies for marketing approval. If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet anticipated or reasonable development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval. If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) allowing reliance on data in a previously approved drug application owned by a third party, or there is a change in the law affecting Section 505(b)(2), this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) application that we submit.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for our product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as \u201corphan drugs.\u201d Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for the type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.\nOrphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Additionally, if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. This means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain circumstances, including proving clinical superiority (i.e., another product is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care) to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity, or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective.\nModifications to our products may require new drug or device approvals.\nOnce a particular product receives FDA approval or clearance, expanded uses or uses in new indications of our products may require additional human clinical trials and new regulatory approvals or clearances, including additional IND and NDA/BLA submissions or premarket approvals before we can begin clinical development, and/or prior to marketing and sales. If the FDA requires new clearances or approvals for a particular use or indication, we may be required to conduct additional clinical studies, which would require additional expenditures and harm our operating results. If the products are already being used for these new indications, we may also be subject to significant enforcement actions. Conducting clinical trials and obtaining clearances and approvals can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals could adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nConducting successful clinical studies may require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit.\nPatient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population; the nature of the trial protocol; the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects; the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators; support staff; proximity of patients to clinical sites; ability to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial; and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts. Patients may also not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of competitive products.\nAdditional delays to the completion of clinical studies may result from modifications being made to the protocol during the clinical trial, if such modifications are warranted and/or required by the occurrences in the given trial.\nEach modification to the protocol during a clinical trial has to be submitted to the FDA. This could result in the delay or halt of a clinical trial while the modification is evaluated. In addition, depending on the quantity and nature of the changes made, the FDA could take the position that the data generated by the clinical trial is not poolable because the same protocol was not used throughout the trial. This might require the enrollment of additional subjects, which could result in the extension of the clinical trial and the FDA delaying clearance or approval of a product. Any such delay could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the data generated from our clinical trials using modified protocols will be acceptable to FDA.\nThere can be no assurance that the data generated using modified protocols will be acceptable to the FDA or that if future modifications during the trial are necessary, that any such modifications will be acceptable to the FDA. If the FDA believes that its prior approval is required for a particular modification, it can delay or halt a clinical trial while it evaluates additional information regarding the change.\nSerious injury or death resulting from a failure of one of our drug candidates during clinical trials could also result in the FDA delaying our clinical trials or denying or delaying clearance or approval of a product candidate. Even though an adverse event may not be the result of the failure of our drug candidate, the FDA or an IRB could delay or halt a clinical trial for an indefinite period of time while an adverse event is reviewed, and likely would do so in the event of multiple such events.\nAny delay or termination of our current or future clinical trials as a result of the risks summarized above, including delays in obtaining or maintaining required approvals from IRBs, delays in patient enrollment, the failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial, and delays or termination of clinical trials as a result of protocol modifications or adverse events during the trials, may cause an increase in costs and delays in the filing of any product submissions with the FDA, delay the approval and commercialization of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our products.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials for our product candidates, and we must rely on third parties, such as CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct such trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations, meet expected deadlines or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe future results of our current or future clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of unexpected adverse side effects.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our drug candidate claims or that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our drug candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses. If the FDA or other regulatory agencies conclude that the clinical trials for any of our product candidates has failed to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, we would not receive clearance from the FDA or other regulatory agencies to market that product in the United States or internationally for the indications sought.\nIn addition, such an outcome could cause us to abandon the product candidate and might delay development of other product candidates. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of any product submissions with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s profile. In addition, our clinical trials may involve a relatively small patient population. Because of the small sample size, our results may not be indicative of future results.\nEven if our product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities, if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA regulations or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nThe manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA. In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations and International Standards Organization (\u201cISO\u201d) regulations for the manufacture of our products and other regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval. Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, enforce these regulations through periodic inspections. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, enforcement actions by the FDA.\nIf any of these actions were to occur it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nEven if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, such clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce the potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that the product promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we or our commercialization partners cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider such training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with adverse event and pharmacovigilance reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events which occur in connection with, and whether or not directly related to, our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to recall, replace or refund the cost of any product we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur revenue stream will depend upon third-party reimbursement.\nThe commercial success of our products in both domestic and international markets will be substantially dependent on whether third-party coverage and reimbursement is available for patients that use our products. However, the availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved therapies is uncertain, and therefore, third-party coverage may be particularly difficult to obtain even if our products are approved by the FDA as safe and efficacious. Patients using existing approved therapies are generally reimbursed all or part of the product cost by Medicare or other third-party payors. Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for these products. Submission of applications for reimbursement approval generally does not occur prior to the filing of an NDA for that product and may not be granted for as long as many months after NDA approval. In order to obtain reimbursement arrangements for these products, we or our commercialization partners may have to agree to a net sales price lower than the net sales price we might charge in other sales channels. The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may limit our revenue. Initial dependence on the commercial success of our products may make our revenues particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain for such product candidates.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act (\u201cMMA\u201d) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our product candidates and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cHealth Care Reform Law\u201d) is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.\nThe Health Care Reform Law remains subject to legislative efforts to repeal, modify or delay the implementation of the law. However, if the Health Care Reform Law is repealed or modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law are delayed, such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law on us at this time. Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms, we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce or eliminate our profitability.\nWe are dependent on third parties for manufacturing and marketing of our proposed product candidates. If we are not able to secure favorable arrangements with such third parties, our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe will not manufacture any of our proposed product candidates for commercial sale nor do we have the resources necessary to do so. In addition, we currently do not have the capability to market our drug products ourselves. In addition to our internal sales force efforts, we have contracted with and intend to continue to contract with specialized manufacturing companies to manufacture our proposed product candidates and partner with larger pharmaceutical companies for commercialization of our products. In connection with our efforts to commercialize our proposed product candidates, we will seek to secure favorable arrangements with third parties to distribute, promote, market and sell our proposed product candidates. If our internal sales force is unable to successfully distribute, market and promote our product candidates and we are not able to secure favorable commercial terms or arrangements with third parties for the distribution, marketing, promotion and sales of our proposed product candidates, we may have to retain promotional and marketing rights and seek to develop the commercial resources necessary to promote or co-promote or co-market certain or all of our proposed drug candidates to the appropriate channels of distribution in order to reach the specific medical market that we are targeting. We may not be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on this or any other basis. If we are not able to secure favorable partnering arrangements or are unable to develop the appropriate resources necessary for the commercialization of our proposed product candidates, our business and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, we will have to hire additional employees or consultants, since our current employees have limited experience in these areas. Sufficient employees with relevant skills may not be available to us. Any increase in the number of our employees would increase our expense level and could have an adverse effect on our financial position.\nIn addition, we, or our potential commercial partners, may not successfully introduce our proposed product candidates or such candidates may not achieve acceptance by patients, health care providers and insurance companies. Further, it is possible that we may not be able to secure arrangements to manufacture, market, distribute, promote and sell our proposed product candidates at favorable commercial terms that would permit us to make a profit. To the extent that corporate partners conduct clinical trials, we may not be able to control the design and conduct of these clinical trials.\nWe may have conflicts with our partners that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may have conflicts with our partners, such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of pre-clinical or clinical data, the achievement of milestones, the interpretation of contractual obligations, payments for services, development obligations or the ownership of intellectual property developed during our collaboration. If any conflicts arise with any of our partners, such partner may act in a manner that is averse to our best interests. Any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following, each of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates, and in turn prevent us from generating revenues: unwillingness on the part of a partner to pay us milestone payments or royalties we believe are due to us under a collaboration; uncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights arising from our collaborative activities, which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations; unwillingness by the partner to cooperate in the development or manufacture of the product, including providing us with product data or materials; unwillingness on the part of a partner to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities; initiating of litigation or alternative dispute resolution options by either party to resolve the dispute; or attempts by either party to terminate the agreement.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited.\nIf approved for marketing, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon each product\u2019s acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance for any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf relative convenience, dosing burden and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians to prescribe our product candidates, and the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u25cf efficacy of our product candidates compared to competing products;\n\u25cf the introduction of any new products that may in the future become available targeting indications for which our product candidates may be approved;\n\u25cf new procedures or therapies that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications in which our product candidates may show utility;\n\u25cf pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf the inclusion or omission of our product candidates in applicable therapeutic and vaccine guidelines;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our own or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in approved labeling from regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors or to receive the necessary pricing approvals from government bodies regulating the pricing and usage of therapeutics; and\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement or government pricing approvals.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities thereby giving other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render our product candidates not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve any of our product candidates with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization for that indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals or require risk management plans or a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our product candidates. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our product candidates.\nOur products will face significant competition, and if they are unable to compete successfully, our business will suffer.\nOur product candidates face, and will continue to face, intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic and research institutions. We compete in an industry that is characterized by: (i) rapid technological change, (ii) evolving industry standards, (iii) emerging competition and (iv) new product introductions. Our competitors have and may develop products and technologies that will compete with our products and technologies. Because several competing companies and institutions have greater financial resources than us, they may be able to: (i) provide broader services and product lines, (ii) make greater investments in research and development and (iii) carry on larger research and development initiatives. Our competitors also have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking pre-clinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. They also have greater name recognition and better access to customers than us.\nAdverse events involving our products may lead the FDA or other regulatory agencies to delay or deny clearance for our products or result in product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nOnce a product receives clearance or approval, the agency has the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of adverse side effects, material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. With respect to the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the product would cause serious injury or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of adverse side effects, impurities or other product contamination, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial enforcement actions, including civil and criminal penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSales of our product candidates, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.\n\u25cf federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (\u201cCMPL\u201d), prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u25cf The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nAlso, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government\u2019s and/or pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to our business are complex, changing and often subject to varying interpretations. As a result, we may not be able to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. Any violation or alleged violation of any of these laws or regulations by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We may be a party to various lawsuits, demands, claims, qui tam suits, government investigations and audits, of which any could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, reputational harm, termination of relationships or contracts related to our business, mandated refunds, substantial payments made by us, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in Medicare and other healthcare programs and possible criminal penalties.\nIf we are found in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including:\n\u25cf suspension or termination of our participation in federal healthcare programs;\n\u25cf criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act, CMPL, and Anti-Kickback Statute;\n\u25cf enforcement actions by governmental agencies or claims for monetary damages by patients under federal or state patient privacy laws, including HIPAA;\n\u25cf repayment of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements, and related monetary penalties;\n\u25cf mandated changes to our practices or procedures that materially increase operating expenses;\n\u25cf imposition of corporate integrity agreements that could subject us to ongoing audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of our business practices;\n\u25cf termination of various relationships or contracts related to our business; and\n\u25cf harm to our reputation which could negatively affect our business relationships, decrease our ability to attract or retain patients and physicians, decrease access to new business opportunities and impact our ability to obtain financing, among other things.\nResponding to lawsuits and other proceedings as well as defending ourselves in such matters will continue to require management\u2019s attention and cause us to incur significant legal expense. It is also possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us or individuals in our business in connection with investigations by the federal government.\nFurthermore, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.\nIf a third-party contract manufacturing organization (\u201cCMO\u201d) upon whom we rely to formulate and manufacture our product candidates does not perform, fails to manufacture according to our specifications or fails to comply with strict regulations, our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials could be adversely affected, and the development of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated or we could incur significant additional expenses.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on and intend to continue to rely on CMOs to formulate and manufacture our pre-clinical and clinical materials. Our reliance on a CMO exposes us to a number of risks, any of which could delay or prevent the completion of our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, or the regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenues. Some of these risks include:\n\u25cf our CMO failing to develop an acceptable formulation to support later-stage clinical trials for, or the commercialization of, our product candidates;\n\u25cf our CMO failing to manufacture our product candidate according to our specifications, the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements, or otherwise manufacturing material that we or the FDA may deem to be unsuitable in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf our CMO being unable to increase the scale of, increase the capacity for, or reformulate the form of our product candidates. We may experience a shortage in supply, or the cost to manufacture our products may increase to the point where it may adversely affect the cost of our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our CMO will be able to manufacture our product candidates at a suitable scale, or we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us that can do so;\n\u25cf our CMO placing a priority on the manufacture of their own products, or other customers\u2019 products;\n\u25cf our CMO failing to perform as agreed upon or not remain in business; and\n\u25cf our CMO\u2019s plants being closed as a result of regulatory sanctions, natural disasters, health epidemics or otherwise.\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with FDA mandated cGMPs, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. While we are obligated to audit their performance, we do not have control over our CMO\u2019s compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by any of our CMOs, or us, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the CMOs. These sanctions may include fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant pre-market approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business.\nIn the event that we need to change our CMOs, our pre-clinical studies, clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, adversely affected or terminated, or such a change may result in significantly higher costs.\nVarious steps in the manufacture of our product candidates may need to be sole-sourced. In accordance with cGMP, changing manufacturers may require the re-validation of manufacturing processes and procedures, and may require further pre-clinical studies or clinical trials to show comparability between the materials produced by different manufacturers. Changing our current or future CMOs may be difficult for us and could be costly, which could result in our inability to manufacture our product candidates for an extended period of time and therefore a delay in the development of our product candidates. Further, in order to maintain our development time lines in the event of a change in our CMOs, we may incur significantly higher costs to manufacture our product candidates.\nHealthcare Reform in the United States.\nIn the United States, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect the future results of pharmaceutical manufactures\u2019 operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. On the federal level, the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) was enacted in March 2010, and included measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA that have been of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:\n\u25cf an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u25cf implementation of the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the \u201cPhysician Payments Sunshine Act\u201d;\n\u25cf a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u25cf creation of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u25cf establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending;\n\u25cf an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price;\n\u25cf adoption of methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u25cf extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u25cf expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u25cf creation of a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and\n\u25cf expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program.\nAlthough there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, the Biden Administration has affirmed support for the law, entered its own executive orders to enforce and strengthen it, and committed to examining and, where appropriate, reversing contrary Trump Administration policies. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\nBecause of the volatility surrounding the implementation and enforcement of the ACA since its passage, and at this time, the full effect that the ACA would have on a pharmaceutical manufacturer remains unclear. This uncertainty is heightened by President Biden\u2019s January 28, 2021 Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act which indicates that the Biden Administration may significantly modify the ACA and further reform the ACA and other federal programs in manner that may impact our operations. The Biden Administration has indicated that a goal of its administration is to expand and support Medicaid and the ACA and to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable. The potential increase in patients covered by government funded insurance may impact our pricing. Further, it is possible that the Biden Administration may further increase scrutiny of drug pricing.\nAdditionally, in December 2019, a federal appeals court held that the individual mandate portion of the ACA was unconstitutional and left open the question whether the remaining provisions of the ACA would be valid without the individual mandate. However, on appeal, the Supreme Court ruled in June 2021 that the parties challenging the law lacked standing, leaving the ACA in place. It is unclear how any other potential litigation challenging the ACA and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services.\nMoreover, prescription drug pricing has been a recent focus of federal policymaking. The Trump Administration issued a series of executive orders and rules related to prescription drug pricing, including executive orders in July and September 2020 focused on reducing drug prices and rules in November 2020 establishing a \u2018Most Favored Nation\u2019 rule tying Medicare Part B drug pricing to prices in other countries, as well as a rule effectively banning rebates from Medicare Part D. The Biden Administration has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority for the Biden Administration as well.\nFurther, there is uncertainty surrounding the applicability of the biosimilars provisions under the ACA. The FDA has issued several guidance documents, but no implementing regulations, on biosimilars. A number of biosimilar applications have been approved over the past few years. The regulations that are ultimately promulgated and their implementation are likely to have considerable impact on the way pharmaceutical manufacturers conduct their business and may require changes to current strategies. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an approved drug notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the approved drug in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.\nIndividual states have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm a pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce ultimate demand for certain products or put pressure product pricing, which could negatively affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and biologics and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While no one cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in decreased reimbursement for drugs and biologics, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm a pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s ability to generate revenue. Increases in importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical products from foreign countries into the United States could put competitive pressure on a pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s ability to profitably price products, which, in turn, could adversely affect business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. A pharmaceutical manufacturer might elect not to seek approval for or market products in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize the risk of re-importation, which could also reduce the revenue generated from product sales. It is also possible that other legislative proposals having similar effects will be adopted.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities\u2019 assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects. For example, average review times at the FDA for marketing approval applications can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes.\nSecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and/or our physical buildings could expose us to liability and damage our reputation and business.\nIt is essential to our business strategy that our technology and network infrastructure and our physical buildings remain secure and are perceived by our customers and corporate partners to be secure. Despite security measures, however, any network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers and other security threats. We may face cyber-attacks that attempt to penetrate our network security, sabotage or otherwise disable our research, products and services, misappropriate our or our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 proprietary information, which may include personally identifiable information, or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services. Despite security measures, we also cannot guarantee security of our physical buildings. Physical building penetration or any cyber-attacks could negatively affect our reputation, damage our network infrastructure and our ability to deploy our products and services, harm our relationship with customers and partners that are affected, and expose us to financial liability.\nAdditionally, there are a number of state, federal and international laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data. For example, HIPAA imposes limitations on the use and disclosure of an individual\u2019s healthcare information by healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health insurance plans, or, collectively, covered entities, and also grants individuals rights with respect to their health information. HIPAA also imposes compliance obligations and corresponding penalties for non-compliance on individuals and entities that provide services to healthcare providers and other covered entities. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\u201cARRA\u201d) the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA were amended. ARRA also made significant increases in the penalties for improper use or disclosure of an individual\u2019s health information under HIPAA and extended enforcement authority to state attorneys general. As amended by ARRA and subsequently by the final omnibus rule adopted in 2013, HIPAA also imposes notification requirements on covered entities in the event that certain health information has been inappropriately accessed or disclosed, notification requirements to individuals, federal regulators, and in some cases, notification to local and national media. Notification is not required under HIPAA if the health information that is improperly used or disclosed is deemed secured in accordance with encryption or other standards developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Most states have laws requiring notification of affected individuals and/or state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information protected by HIPAA. Many state laws impose significant data security requirements, such as encryption or mandatory contractual terms, to ensure ongoing protection of personal information. Activities outside of the U.S. implicate local and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements and generate additional risks of enforcement for non-compliance. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws, to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe rely upon licenses granted to us by various licensors, and if such licensors do not adequately defend such licenses, our business may be harmed.\nWe have entered into and may, in the future, enter into license and sublicense agreements with respect to our product candidates. We have limited control over the activities of our licensors, and we rely upon our licensors to protect their intellectual property, including the patents covered by our licenses. We cannot be certain that activities conducted by our licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, we have no or limited control or input over whether, and in what manner, our licensors may enforce or defend the patents that we license against a third-party. Our licensors may defend the patents we license less vigorously than if we had enforced or defended the patents ourselves. Furthermore, our licensors may not necessarily seek enforcement in scenarios in which we would feel that enforcement was in our best interests. For example, our licensors may not enforce the patents against a competitor of ours who is not a direct competitor of such licensor. If our in-licensed intellectual property is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then our licensors may not be able to enforce the patents against a competitor of ours. Moreover, if we fail to meet our obligations under our license agreements, the licensor may terminate the license agreement. Furthermore, if we fail to meet our obligations under our sublicense agreements or our sublicensor fails to meet its obligations to the licensor, such licensor may terminate the license agreement thereby terminating our sublicense agreement.\nOur business depends upon us securing and protecting critical intellectual property.\nAlthough we do not own and only license intellectual property, to the extent we develop intellectual property, our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark protection of our technologies in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as successfully enforcing and defending such intellectual property rights against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable intellectual property protection, such as patents or trade secrets, cover them. In particular, we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. Moreover, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain for products that are currently in the early stages of development because we cannot predict which of these products will ultimately reach the commercial market or whether the commercial versions of these products will incorporate proprietary technologies.\nPatent positions in our industry are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions.\nPatent positions in our industry are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. For example, we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our pending patent applications and issued patents, as applicable; we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies; it is possible that none of our pending patent applications or the pending patent applications of our licensors will result in issued patents; our issued patents and issued patents of our licensors may not provide a basis for commercially viable technologies, or may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties; and, we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable. As a result, our owned and licensed patents may not be valid, and we may not be able to obtain and enforce patents and to maintain trade secret protection for the full commercial extent of our technology. The extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm our business.\nWe or our licensors have applied for and will continue to apply for patents for certain products. Such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, and any patents now held or that may be issued may not provide us with adequate protection from competition. Furthermore, it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged successfully. In that event, if we have a preferred competitive position because of such patents, any preferred position held by us would be lost. If we are unable to secure or to continue to maintain a preferred position, we could become subject to competition from the sale of generic products. Failure to receive, inability to protect, or expiration of our patents for medical use, manufacture, conjugation and labeling of any of our product candidates may adversely affect our business and operations.\nPatents issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of others. The cost of enforcing our patent rights against infringers, if such enforcement is required, could be significant, and we do not currently have the financial resources to fund such litigation. Further, such litigation can go on for years and the time demands could interfere with our normal operations. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. We may become a party to patent litigation and other proceedings. The cost to us of any patent litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Litigation may also absorb significant management time.\nUnpatented trade secrets, improvements, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation are important to our scientific and commercial success. Although we attempt to and will continue to attempt to protect our proprietary information through reliance on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and other appropriate means, these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, and, in any event, others may develop independently, or obtain access to, the same or similar information.\nIf we are found to be infringing on patents or trade secrets owned by others, we may be forced to cease or alter our product development efforts, obtain a license to continue the development or sale of our products, and/or pay damages.\nOur manufacturing processes and potential products may violate proprietary rights of patents that have been or may be granted to competitors, universities or others, or the trade secrets of those persons and entities. As the pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our processes and potential products may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents or trade secrets of others. These other persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or process. If any of these actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to conduct clinical tests, manufacture or market the affected product or use the affected process. Required licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and the results of litigation are uncertain. If we become involved in litigation or other proceedings, it could consume a substantial portion of our financial resources and the efforts of our personnel.\nOur ability to protect and enforce any patents we may obtain does not guaranty that we will secure the right to commercialize such patents.\nA patent is a limited monopoly right conferred upon an inventor, and his successors in title, in return for the making and disclosing of a new and non-obvious invention. This monopoly is of limited duration but, while in force, allows the patent holder to prevent others from making and/or using his invention. While a patent gives the holder this right to exclude others, it is not a license to commercialize the invention, where other permissions may be required for permissible commercialization to occur. For example, a drug cannot be marketed without the appropriate authorization from the FDA, regardless of the existence of a patent covering the product. Further, the invention, even if patented itself, cannot be commercialized if it infringes the valid patent rights of another party.\nWe rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our trade secrets. If these agreements are breached by our employees or other parties, our trade secrets may become known to our competitors.\nWe rely on trade secrets which we seek to protect through confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties. If these agreements are breached, our competitors may obtain and use our trade secrets to gain a competitive advantage over us. We may not have any remedies against our competitors and any remedies that may be available to us may not be adequate to protect our business or compensate us for the damaging disclosure. In addition, we may have to expend resources to protect our interests from possible infringement by others.\nRelated Risks to the Company\nWe have expanded and may continue to expand, our business through the acquisition of rights to new drug candidates that could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and may also dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests in our Company.\nOur business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities, and we may seek acquisitions of additional drug candidates or technologies to do so. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including substantial cash expenditures; potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities; incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition; difficulties in assimilating the acquired technologies or the operations of the acquired companies; diverting our management\u2019s attention away from other business concerns; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience; and the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies.\nWe cannot assure you that any acquisition will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. We may misjudge the value or worth of an acquired product, company or business. In addition, our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired products, businesses or companies work or be successful. Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business or any acquired products, business or companies may require a substantial capital investment by us. We may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our preferred or common stock, which could dilute each current shareholder\u2019s ownership interest in the Company.\nAny international operations we undertake may subject us to risks inherent with operations outside of the United States.\nWe may seek to obtain market clearance for in foreign markets that we deem to generate significant opportunities. However, even with the cooperation of a commercialization partner, conducting drug development in foreign countries involves inherent risks, including, but not limited to: difficulties in staffing, funding and managing foreign operations; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; export restrictions; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in protecting, acquiring, enforcing and litigating intellectual property rights; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and potentially adverse tax consequences. If we were to experience any of the difficulties listed above, or any other difficulties, our international development activities and our overall financial condition may suffer and cause us to reduce or discontinue our international development and registration efforts.\nWe may not be successful in hiring and retaining key employees, including executive officers.\nOur future operations and successes depend in large part upon the strength of our management team. We rely heavily on the continued service of each member of our management team. Accordingly, if any member of our management team were to terminate their employment with us, such departure may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire or engage, retain and motivate other well-qualified financial, managerial, technical, clinical and regulatory personnel. There can be no assurance that these professionals will be available in the market, or that we will be able to retain existing professionals or to meet or to continue to meet their compensation requirements. Furthermore, the cost base in relation to such compensation, which may include equity compensation, may increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Failure to establish and maintain an effective management team and work force could adversely affect our ability to operate, grow and manage our business.\nManaging our growth as we expand operations may strain our resources.\nWe expect to grow rapidly in order to support additional, larger, and potentially international, pivotal clinical trials of our drug candidates, which will place a significant strain on our financial, managerial and operational resources. In order to achieve and manage growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our operational and financial management capabilities. Moreover, we will need to increase staffing and to train, motivate and manage our employees. All of these activities will increase our expenses and may require us to raise additional capital sooner than expected. Failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf a product liability claim is successfully brought against us for uninsured liabilities, or such claim exceeds our insurance coverage, we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards that could materially harm our business.\nThe use of any of our existing or future product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved pharmaceutical products may expose us to significant product liability claims. We currently do not have product liability insurance coverage but we intend to obtain such insurance. Such insurance coverage may not protect us against any or all of the product liability claims that may be brought against us in the future. We may not be able to acquire or maintain adequate product liability insurance coverage at a commercially reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses. In the event a product liability claim is brought against us, we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us. In the event our product candidate is approved for sale by the FDA or other regulatory agency and commercialized, we may need to substantially increase the amount of our product liability coverage. Defending any product liability claim or claims could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nThe outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) evolved into a global pandemic. The coronavirus has spread to many regions of the world. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the coronavirus, including variants, and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nShould the coronavirus continue to spread, our business operations could be delayed or interrupted. For instance, our clinical trials may be affected by the pandemic. Site initiation, participant recruitment and enrollment, participant dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis may be paused or delayed due to changes in hospital or university policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital resources toward pandemic efforts, or other reasons related to the pandemic. If the coronavirus continues to spread, some participants and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols. For example, quarantines or other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) may impede participant movement, affect sponsor access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services, and we may be unable to conduct our clinical trials. Further, if the spread of the coronavirus pandemic continues and our operations are adversely impacted, we risk a delay, default and/or nonperformance under existing agreements which may increase our costs. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.\nInfections and deaths related to the pandemic may disrupt the United States\u2019 healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems. Such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay FDA review and/or approval with respect to, our clinical trials. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of our product candidates.\nWe currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture raw materials. If any third parties in the supply chain for materials used in the production of our product candidates are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and research and development operations.\nIn the event of a shelter-in-place order or other mandated local travel restrictions, our employees conducting research and development, or manufacturing activities may not be able to access their laboratory or manufacturing space, and our core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time.\nThe spread of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, may have a material economic effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, our research programs, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nYou should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are:\n\u25cf sale of our common stock by our shareholders, executives, and directors;\n\u25cf volatility and limitations in trading volumes of our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financings to conduct and complete research and development activities including, but not limited to, our clinical trials, and other business activities;\n\u25cf the timing and success of introductions of new products by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to attract new customers;\n\u25cf our ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to conduct clinical trials on our desired schedule;\n\u25cf commencement, enrollment or results of our clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u25cf changes in the development status of our product candidates;\n\u25cf any delays or adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to a regulatory agency\u2019s review of our planned pre-clinical and clinical trials;\n\u25cf any delay in our submission for studies or product approvals or adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf unanticipated safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure or dividend policy, future issuances of securities and sales of large blocks of common stock by our shareholders;\n\u25cf our cash position;\n\u25cf announcements and events surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities;\n\u25cf our inability to enter into new markets or develop new products;\n\u25cf reputational issues;\n\u25cf announcements of acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, new products, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in general economic, political and market conditions in or any of the regions in which we conduct our business;\n\u25cf changes in industry conditions or perceptions;\n\u25cf analyst research reports, recommendation and changes in recommendations, price targets, and withdrawals of coverage;\n\u25cf departures and additions of key personnel;\n\u25cf disputes and litigations related to intellectual properties, proprietary rights, and contractual obligations;\n\u25cf changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which may be out of our control, including, but not limited to, pandemics such as COVID-19, war, or other acts of God.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our shareholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, applications and services or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIn addition, we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u25cf difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u25cf difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf adverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees;\n\u25cf use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u25cf use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial position may suffer.\nMarket and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nConcerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining real estate market, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices have led to periods of significant economic instability, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward, increased unemployment rates, and increased credit defaults in recent years. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns, volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance, and share price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization plans.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume may decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our markets and our competitors. We do not control these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the market and interest in our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and may also impair our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers.\nFuture sales and issuances of our securities could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our shareholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including research and development, increased marketing, hiring new personnel, commercializing our products, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing shareholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing shareholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to shareholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we intend to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation. In the past, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOn December 30, 2021, we received written notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of our common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810, we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until June 28, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period. In the event we do not regain compliance by June 28, 2022, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period if we meet the continued listing standards, with the exception of bid price, for The Nasdaq Capital Market, and we provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. Although we may effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock in the future, there can be no assurance that such reverse stock split will enable us to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement.\nFinancial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time-consuming, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nAs a publicly traded company we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The obligations of being a public company in the United States require significant expenditures and places significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under Sarbanes-Oxley, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market. These rules require the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult to implement, monitor and maintain compliance with. Moreover, despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, the reporting requirements, rules, and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations, otherwise we may fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under Sarbanes-Oxley related to internal controls and procedures in the future, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nSection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we fail to comply with the rules under Sarbanes-Oxley related to disclosure controls and procedures in the future, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended (\u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d), our Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Nevada law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders. We are authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which are outstanding as of March 28, 2022. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors without further action by shareholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. As of March 28, 2022, 5,000,000 shares of our preferred stock have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock of which 3,102,480 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were previously issued and converted into common stock at the time of our initial public offering and 1,897,520 shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain authorized. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control by the present management.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Nevada law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a shareholder might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, the Articles of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Nevada law, as applicable, among other things:\n\u25cf provide the board of directors with the ability to alter the Amended and Restated Bylaws without shareholder approval;\n\u25cf place limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at shareholder meetings; and\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain disputes which could limit shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or its directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada shall be the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims with respect to: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought in the name or right of us or on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of any fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action arising or asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Nevada Revised Statutes Chapters 78 or 92A or any provision of our Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, including, without limitation, any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other employees or agents and may result in increased costs to our shareholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees and agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Amended and Restated Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18402, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HOTH"}
