{"cik": "55135", "company": "KELLY SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with low barriers to entry and may be unable to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.\nThe worldwide staffing services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. We compete in global, national, regional and local markets with full-service and specialized temporary staffing and consulting companies. Randstad, Adecco Group, ManpowerGroup Inc., Recruit Holdings and Allegis Group, are considerably larger than we are and have more substantial marketing and financial resources. Additionally, the emergence of online staffing platforms or other forms of disintermediation may pose a competitive threat to our services, which operate under a more traditional staffing business model. Price competition in the staffing industry is intense, particularly for the provision of office clerical and light industrial personnel. We expect that the level of competition will remain high, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.\nThe number of customers distributing their staffing service purchases among a broader group of competitors continues to increase which, in some cases, may make it more difficult for us to obtain new customers, or to retain or maintain our current share of business, with existing customers. We also face the risk that our current or prospective customers may decide to provide similar services internally. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future.\nOur business is significantly affected by fluctuations in general economic conditions.\nDemand for staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity and employment in the United States and the other countries in which we operate. When economic activity increases, temporary employees are often added before full-time employees are hired. As economic activity slows, however, many companies reduce their use of temporary employees before laying off full-time employees. Significant swings in economic activity historically have had a disproportionate impact on staffing industry volumes. We may not fully benefit from times of increased economic activity should we experience shortages in the supply of temporary employees. We may also experience more competitive pricing pressure and slower customer payments during periods of economic downturn. A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings are generated by our business operations in the United States. Any significant economic downturn in the United States or certain other countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnological advances may significantly disrupt the labor market and weaken demand for human capital at a rapid rate.\nOur success is directly dependent on our customers\u2019 demands for talent. As technology continues to evolve, more tasks currently performed by people may be replaced by automation, robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and other technological advances outside of our control. This trend poses a risk to the staffing industry as a whole, particularly in lower-skill job categories that may be more susceptible to such replacement.\nOur business strategy may be insufficient or not achieve its intended effects.\nOur business strategy focuses on driving profitable growth in key specialty areas. We are making targeted investments in our chosen specialties, focusing on growth platforms and developing a more robust operating model to bridge our strategy to execution. If we are unsuccessful in executing our strategy, we may not achieve either our stated goal of revenue growth or the intended productivity improvements, which could negatively impact profitability. Even if effectively executed, our strategy may prove insufficient in light of changes in market conditions, technology, competitive pressures or other external factors.\nWe are at risk of damage to our brand, which is important to our success.\nOur success depends, in part, on the goodwill associated with our brand. Because we assign employees to work under the direction and supervision of our customer at work locations not under Kelly\u2019s control, we are at risk of our employees engaging in unauthorized conduct that could harm our reputation. Moreover, significant disputes with clients or suppliers, compliance violations, cyberattacks, customer dissatisfaction, social media incidents, media reports, or corporate sustainability issues could harm our reputation. Our Kelly Education product is particularly susceptible to this exposure. An occurrence that damages Kelly\u2019s reputation could cause the loss of current and future customers, additional regulatory scrutiny and liability to third parties, which could negatively impact profitability.\nOur intellectual property assets could be infringed upon or compromised, and there are limitations to our ability to protect against such events.\nOur success is dependent in part on our proprietary business processes, our intellectual property and our thought leadership. To protect those rights, we depend upon protections afforded by the laws of the various countries in which we operate, as well as contractual language and our own enforcement initiatives. These defenses may not be sufficient to fully protect us or to deter infringement or other misappropriation of our trade secrets and other intellectual property. In addition, third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We also face the risk that third parties may allege that the operation of our business infringes or otherwise misappropriates intellectual property rights that they own or license. Losses or claims of this nature could cause us to incur significant expense, harm our reputation, reduce our competitive advantages or prevent us from offering certain services or solutions. The remedies available to us may be limited or leave us without full compensation.\nIf we fail to successfully develop new service offerings, we may be unable to retain our current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline.\nThe process of developing new service offerings requires accurate anticipation of customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends. This may require that we make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in service offerings that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. If we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers\u2019 needs through the development of new service offerings or do not successfully deliver new service offerings, our competitive position could be weakened and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs we increasingly offer services outside the realm of traditional staffing, including business process outsourcing and services intended to connect talent to independent work, we are exposed to additional risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business strategy focuses on driving profitable growth in key specialty areas, including through business process outsourcing arrangements, where we provide operational management of our customers\u2019 non-core functions or departments. This could expose us to certain risks unique to that business, including product liability or product recalls. In addition, as the nature of work changes, we deliver services that connect talent to independent work with our customers and expect that such services will continue to expand. Although we have internal vetting processes intended to control such risks, there is no assurance that these processes will be effective or that we will be able to identify these potential risks in a timely manner. Additionally, while we maintain insurance in types and amounts we believe are appropriate in light of the aforementioned exposures, there can also be no assurance that such insurance policies will remain available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage.\nWe are increasingly dependent on third parties for the execution of critical functions.\nWe leverage many cloud-based services in our business operations, including vendor management, customer relationship management, and applicant tracking systems. We have elected to enter into supplier partnerships rather than establishing or maintaining our own operations in some of the territories where our customers require our services. We do not maintain a controlling interest in our expanded staffing joint venture in Asia Pacific (PersolKelly Asia Pacific) and have elected to rely on the joint venture to provide certain back office and administrative services to our GTS operations in the region. The failure or inability to perform on the part of one or more of these critical suppliers or partners could cause significant disruptions and increased costs.\nPast and future acquisitions may not be successful.\nFrom time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention from its existing operations, the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business, the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements, the potentially substantial transaction costs associated with acquisitions, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business and the inability to successfully integrate the business into our operations. Potential impairment losses could result if we overpay for an acquisition. There can be no assurance that any past or future acquired businesses will generate anticipated revenues or earnings.\nInvestments in equity affiliates expose us to additional risks and uncertainties.\nWe participate, or may participate in the future, in certain investments in equity affiliates, such as joint ventures or other equity method investments with strategic partners, including PersolKelly Asia Pacific. These arrangements expose us to a number of risks, including the risk that the management of the combined venture may not be able to fulfill their performance obligations under the management agreements or that the joint venture parties may be incapable of providing the required financial support. Additionally, improper, illegal or unethical actions by the venture management could have a negative impact on the reputation of the venture and our company.\nA loss of major customers or a change in such customers\u2019 buying behavior could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe serve many large corporate customers through high volume global service agreements. While we intend to maintain or increase our revenues and earnings from our major corporate customers, we are exposed to risks arising from the possible loss of major customer accounts. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of these customers could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from these customers. Continuing merger and acquisition activity involving our large corporate customers could put existing business at risk or impose additional pricing pressures. Since receipts from customers generally lag payroll to temporary employees, the bankruptcy of a major customer could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet our working capital requirements. Additionally, most of our customer contracts can be terminated by the customer on short notice without penalty. This creates uncertainty with respect to the revenues and earnings we may recognize with respect to our customer contracts.\nOur business with large customer accounts reflects a market-driven shift in buying behaviors in which reliance on a small number of staffing partners has shifted to reliance upon a network of talent providers. The movement from single-sourced to competitively sourced staffing contracts may also substantially reduce our future revenues from such customers. While Kelly has sought to address this trend, including providing Contingent Workforce Outsourcing (\"CWO\") services within our GTS segment, we may not be selected or retained as the CWO service provider by our large customers. This may result in a material decrease in the revenue we derive from providing staffing services to such customers. In addition, revenues may be materially impacted from our decision to exit customers due to pricing pressure or other business factors.\nOur business with the federal government and government contractors presents additional risk considerations. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. Failure to meet these obligations could result in civil penalties, fines, suspension of payments, reputational damage, disqualification from doing business with government agencies and other sanctions or adverse consequences. Government procurement practices may change in ways that impose additional costs or risks upon us or pose a competitive disadvantage. Our employees may be unable to obtain or retain the security clearances necessary to conduct business under certain contracts, or we could lose or be unable to secure or retain a necessary facility clearance. Government agencies may temporarily or permanently lose funding for awarded contracts, or there could be delays in the start-up of projects already awarded and funded.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations outside of the United States and we are subject to risks relating to our international business activities, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and numerous legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe conduct our business in most major staffing markets throughout the world. Our operations outside the United States are subject to risks inherent in international business activities, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022restrictions or limitations on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022government intrusions including asset seizures, expropriations or de facto control;\n\u2022varying economic and political conditions;\n\u2022differences in cultures and business practices;\n\u2022differences in employment and tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022differences in accounting and reporting requirements;\n\u2022differences in labor and market conditions;\n\u2022compliance with trade sanctions;\n\u2022changing and, in some cases, complex or ambiguous laws and regulations; and\n\u2022litigation, investigations and claims.\nOur operations outside the United States are reported in the applicable local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Exchange rates for currencies of these countries may fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar and these fluctuations may have an adverse or favorable effect on our operating results when translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.\nOur investment in Persol Holdings exposes us to potential market and currency exchange risks.\nWe are exposed to market and currency risks on our investment in Persol Holdings. The investment is stated at fair value and is marked to market through net earnings. Changes in the market price are based on the Persol Holdings stock price as listed in the Tokyo stock exchange, and such changes may be material. Foreign currency fluctuations on this yen-denominated investment are reflected as a component of other comprehensive income and, accordingly, the exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse or favorable effect on our financial statements.\nOur international operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. As a result, we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage.\nWe depend on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified permanent full-time employees.\nAs we aim to expand the number of clients utilizing our higher margin specialty solutions in support of our growth strategy, we are highly reliant on individuals who possess specialized knowledge and skills to lead related specialty solutions and operations. There can be no assurance that qualified personnel will continue to be available. Our success is increasingly dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain these experts.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified temporary personnel (employed directly by us or through third-party suppliers).\nWe depend on our ability to attract qualified temporary personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our customers. We must continually evaluate our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that qualified personnel will continue to be available in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us and our customers. Our success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit and retain qualified temporary personnel.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and losses, including class action lawsuits and collective actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe employ and assign personnel in the workplaces of other businesses. The risks of these activities include possible claims relating to:\n\u2022discrimination and harassment;\n\u2022wrongful termination or retaliation;\n\u2022violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;\n\u2022apportionment between us and our customer of legal obligations as an employer of temporary employees;\n\u2022classification of workers as employees or independent contractors;\n\u2022employment of unauthorized workers;\n\u2022violations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u2022retroactive entitlement to employee benefits, including health insurance;\n\u2022failure to comply with leave policy requirements; and\n\u2022errors and omissions by our temporary employees, particularly for the actions of professionals such as attorneys, accountants, teachers and scientists.\nWe are also subject to potential risks relating to misuse of customer proprietary information, misappropriation of funds, death or injury to our employees, damage to customer facilities due to negligence of temporary employees, criminal activity and other similar occurrences. We may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these risks. In addition, these occurrences may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. In the U.S. and certain other countries in which we operate, new employment and labor laws and regulations have been proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. In addition, such laws and regulations are arising with increasing frequency at the state and local level in the U.S. and the resulting inconsistency in such laws and regulations results in additional complexity. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies and practices we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. Although we maintain insurance in types and amounts we believe are appropriate in light of the aforementioned exposures, there can also be no assurance that such insurance policies will remain available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage. Additionally, should we have a material inability to produce records as a consequence of litigation or a government investigation, the cost or consequences of such matters could become much greater.\nA failure to maintain the privacy of information entrusted to us could have significant adverse consequences.\nIn the normal course of business we control, we process or have access to personal information regarding our own employees or employment candidates, as well as that of many of our customers or managed suppliers. Information concerning our employees and candidates may also reside in systems controlled by third parties for purposes such as employee benefits and payroll administration. The legal and regulatory environment concerning data privacy is becoming more complex and challenging, and the potential consequences of non-compliance have become more severe. Changes in the regulatory environment, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, impose additional compliance requirements related to the collection, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and retention of personal information, which can increase operating costs and resources to accomplish. Any failure to abide by these regulations or to protect such personal information from inappropriate access or disclosure, whether through social engineering or by accident or other cause, could have severe consequences including fines, litigation, regulatory sanctions including loss of our status as a subscriber to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, reputational damage and loss of customers or employees. Although we have a program designed to preserve the privacy of the personal data that we control or process, as well as personal data that we entrust to third parties, there can be no assurance that our program will meet all current and future regulatory requirements, anticipate all potential methods of unauthorized access, or prevent all inappropriate disclosures. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all such costs or consequences, and there can be no assurance that any insurance that we now maintain will remain available under acceptable terms.\nCyberattacks or other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our systems, services, reputation and financial results.\nWe rely upon multiple information technology systems and networks, some of which are web-based or managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. Our networks and applications are increasingly accessed from locations and by devices not within our physical control, and the specifics of our technology systems and networks may vary by geographic region. In the course of ordinary business, we may store or process proprietary or confidential information concerning our business and financial performance and current, past or prospective employees, customers, vendors and managed suppliers. The secure and consistent operation of these systems, networks and processes is critical to our business operations. Moreover, our temporary employees may be exposed to, or have access to, similar information in the course of their customer assignments. We routinely experience cyberattacks, which may include the use of malware, computer viruses, phishing, social engineering schemes and other means of attempted disruption or unauthorized access.\nThe actions we take to reduce the risk of impairments to our operations or systems and breaches of confidential or proprietary data may not be sufficient to prevent or repel future cyber events or other impairments of our networks or information technologies. An event involving the destruction, modification, accidental or unauthorized release, or theft of sensitive information from systems related to our business, or an attack that results in damage to or unavailability of our key technology systems or those of critical vendors, could result in damage to our reputation, fines, regulatory sanctions or interventions, contractual or financial liabilities, additional compliance and remediation costs, loss of employees or customers, loss of payment card network privileges, operational disruptions and other forms of costs, losses or reimbursements, any of which could materially adversely affect our operations or financial condition. Our cyber security and business continuity plans, and those of our third party vendors, may not be effective in anticipating, preventing and effectively responding to all potential cyber risk exposures. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all such costs or consequences, and there can be no assurance that any insurance that we now maintain will remain available under acceptable terms.\nDamage to our key data centers could affect our ability to sustain critical business applications.\nMany business processes critical to our continued operation are hosted in outsourced facilities in America and Europe. Certain other processes are hosted at our corporate headquarters complex or occur in cloud-based computer environments. These critical processes include, but are not limited to, payroll, customer reporting and order management. Although we have taken steps to protect all such instances by establishing robust data backup and disaster recovery capabilities, the loss of these data centers or access to the cloud-based environments could create a substantial risk of business interruption which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information technology projects may not yield their intended results.\nWe have a number of information technology projects in process or in the planning stages, including improvements to applicant onboarding and tracking systems, order management, and improvements to financial processes such as billing and accounts payable through system consolidation and upgrades. Although the technology is intended to increase productivity and operating efficiencies, these projects may not yield their intended results. Any delays in completing, or an inability to successfully complete, these technology initiatives or an inability to achieve the anticipated efficiencies could adversely affect our operations, liquidity and financial condition. In our information technology projects we rely on our own project work as well as those of third party vendors. If our vendors are unable to provide these services, or if the vendor is replaced by another vendor, we could be subject to business interruptions or data loss which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our information technology investments and strategy may not provide the ability to keep up with evolving industry trends and customer expectations which could weaken our competitive position. We also do not currently utilize a single enterprise resource planning system, which limits our ability and increases the amount of investment and effort necessary to provide global service integration to our customers.\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting.\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nImpairment charges relating to our goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, including equity method investments, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe regularly monitor our goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments for impairment indicators. In conducting our goodwill impairment testing, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to the related net book value. In conducting our impairment analysis of long-lived assets and intangibles, we compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets and intangibles to the related net book values. We review our equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be other-than-temporarily impaired. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of our goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets and equity method investments. In the event that we determine that there is an impairment, we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnexpected changes in claim trends on our workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment, disability and medical benefit plans may negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe self-insure, or otherwise bear financial responsibility for, a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation program, disability and medical benefits claims. Unexpected changes in claim trends, including the severity and frequency of claims, actuarial estimates and medical cost inflation, could result in costs that are significantly different than initially reported. If future claims-related liabilities increase due to unforeseen circumstances, or if we must make unfavorable adjustments to accruals for prior accident years, our costs could increase significantly. In addition, unemployment insurance costs are dependent on benefit claims experience from employees which may vary from current levels and result in increased costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any changes in claims-related liabilities.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may restrict the types of employment services we are permitted to offer or result in additional or increased taxes, including payroll taxes or other costs that reduce our revenues and earnings.\nThe temporary employment industry is heavily regulated in many of the countries in which we operate. Changes in laws or government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services we are permitted to offer or the imposition of new or additional benefit, licensing or tax requirements that could reduce our revenues and earnings. In particular, we are subject to state unemployment taxes in the U.S., which typically increase during periods of increased levels of unemployment. We also receive benefits, such as the work opportunity income tax credit in the U.S., that regularly expire and may not be reinstated. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to fully cover increased costs as a result of any changes in laws or government regulations. Any future changes in laws or government regulations, or interpretations thereof, including additional laws and regulations enacted at a local level may make it more difficult or expensive for us to provide staffing services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we structure and market our services.\nAs a leading staffing and recruiting company, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities, leading to increased scrutiny. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct.\nThe European Commission and its various competition authorities have targeted industry trade associations in which we participate. Any government regulatory actions may hamper our ability to provide the cost-effective benefits to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our services and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:\n\u2022We may have to choose between withdrawing certain services from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those services to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a service delivery.\n\u2022Adverse rulings may act as precedent in other competition law proceedings.\nWe may have additional tax or unclaimed property liabilities that exceed our estimates.\nWe are subject to a multitude of federal, state and local taxes in the jurisdictions we operate in, including the tax provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. We are also subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws. Our tax expense could be materially impacted by changes in tax laws in these jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the mix of income by country. The demographics of our workforce and the visibility of our industry may make it more likely we become a target of government investigations, and we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax and unclaimed property estimates are reasonable, the final determination of audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could materially harm our business.\nWe may not be able to realize value from, or otherwise preserve and utilize, our tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards.\nProvisions in U.S. and foreign tax law could limit the use of tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards in the event of an ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs under U.S. tax law if there is a change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership that exceeds 50% over a rolling three-year period. If we experience an ownership change, inclusive of our Class A and Class B common stock, our tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change may be subject to annual limitations that could reduce, eliminate or defer the utilization. Such limitation could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain specified financial covenants in our bank credit facilities, or credit market events beyond our control, could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks, including risk of loss of access to capital markets.\nOur bank credit facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions. During 2019 we met all of the covenant requirements. Our ability to continue to meet these financial covenants, particularly with respect to interest coverage (see Debt footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements), may not be assured. If we default under this or any other of these requirements, the lenders could declare all outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees to be due and payable or significantly increase the cost of the facility. In these circumstances, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance this indebtedness at favorable rates or at all. Events beyond our control could result in the failure of one or more of our banks, reducing our access to liquidity and potentially resulting in reduced financial and operating flexibility. If broader credit markets were to experience dislocation, our potential access to other funding sources would be limited.\nOur controlling stockholder exercises voting control over our company and has the ability to elect or remove from office all of our directors.\nThe Terence E. Adderley Revocable Trust K (\u201cTrust K\u201d) which became irrevocable upon the death of Terence E. Adderley on October 9, 2018, is the controlling stockholder. In accordance with the provisions of Trust K, William U. Parfet, David M. Hempstead and Andrew H. Curoe were appointed as successor trustees of the trust. Mr. Parfet is the brother of Donald R. Parfet, the Chairman of the board of directors of the Company. The trustees, acting by majority vote, have sole investment and voting power over the shares of Class B common stock held by Trust K, which represent approximately 91.5% of the outstanding Class B shares. The voting rights of our Class B common stock are perpetual and our Class B common stock is not subject to transfer restrictions or mandatory conversion obligations under our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.\nOur Class B common stock is the only class of our common stock entitled to voting rights. The trustees of Trust K are therefore able to exercise voting control with respect to all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election or removal from office of all members of the Company\u2019s board of directors.\nWe are not subject to certain of the listing standards that normally apply to companies whose shares are quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nOur Class A and Class B common stock are quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market. Under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Market, we are deemed to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d by virtue of the fact that Trust K has voting power with respect to more than fifty percent of our outstanding voting stock. A controlled company is not required to have a majority of its board of directors comprised of independent directors. Director nominees are not required to be selected or recommended for the board\u2019s selection by a majority of independent directors or a nominations committee comprised solely of independent directors, nor do the NASDAQ Global Market listing standards require a controlled company to certify the adoption of a formal written charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing the nominations process. A controlled company is also exempt from NASDAQ Global Market\u2019s requirements regarding the determination of officer compensation by a majority of independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. A controlled company is required to have an audit committee composed of at least three directors who are independent as defined under the rules of both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ Global Market further requires that all members of the audit committee have the ability to read and understand fundamental financial statements and that at least one member of the audit committee possess financial sophistication. The independent directors must also meet at least twice a year in meetings at which only they are present.\nWe currently comply with certain of the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Market that do not apply to controlled companies. Our compliance is voluntary, however, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with these standards in the future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. For example, if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us, the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting. The acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to replace directors at any annual meeting, and would not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting, which would require the acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted.\nOur board of directors also has the ability to issue additional shares of common stock which could significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law limits mergers and other business combination transactions involving 15 percent or greater stockholders of Delaware corporations unless certain board or stockholder approval requirements are satisfied. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation.\nOur board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquirer that it did not believe was in our strategic interests. If an acquirer is discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by these or other measures, our shareholders could lose the opportunity to sell their shares at a favorable price.\nThe holders of shares of our Class A common stock are not entitled to voting rights.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, the holders of shares of our Class A common stock are not entitled to voting rights, except as otherwise required by Delaware law. As a result, Class A common stockholders do not have the right to vote for the election of directors or in connection with most other matters submitted for the vote of our stockholders, including mergers and certain other business combination transactions involving the Company.\nOur stock price may be subject to significant volatility and could suffer a decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant volatility. We believe that many factors, including several which are beyond our control, have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. These include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022announcements of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in laws and government regulations;\n\u2022commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022any major change in our board or management;\n\u2022changes in industry trends or conditions; and\n\u2022sales of significant amounts of our common stock or other securities in the market.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. Further, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In such event, the price of our common stock may decline.", "PERMNO": 47387, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "KELYA"}
