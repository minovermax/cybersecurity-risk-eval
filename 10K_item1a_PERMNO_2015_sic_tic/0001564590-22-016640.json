See \u201cDisclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. All amounts disclosed are in thousands except shares, per share amounts, percentages, stores, and number of leases.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives.\nOur business growth depends on the successful execution of our strategic initiatives for our brands. The success of our strategic initiatives depends on a number of factors, including our ability to position our retail and e-commerce businesses for further strategic growth, particularly through omni-channel initiatives, the effectiveness of our wholesale expansion efforts, our ability to apply certain growth strategies modeled on the Vince brand to the Acquired Businesses, our ability to properly identify appropriate future growth opportunities, and other macroeconomic impacts on our business, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Moreover, as we continue to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic, some or all of the strategic\ninitiatives currently contemplated may become infeasible or impractical in the post-pandemic operating environment. There can be no assurance that the strategic initiatives would produce intended positive results and if we are unable to realize the benefits of the strategic initiatives, our financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement and optimize our omni-channel strategy.\nOne of our strategic priorities is to expand our omni-channel capabilities to promote direct-to-consumer growth and enhance customer engagement and shopping experience. Our omni-channel efforts include the integration and implementation of new technology, software, and processes that will further digital integration and customer personalization across our store and digital shopping channels, all of which has involved and will continue to involve significant investments, operational changes and employee resources. These efforts involve risks such as implementation delays, unexpected costs, technology interruptions, supply and distribution difficulties, and other issues that can affect the successful implementation and operation of our omni-channel initiatives. In fiscal 2021, we completed the initial stages of our omni-channel strategy by completing the rollout of a new POS system for the Vince brand. As we continue to adopt and implement these initiatives, including by rolling out a front-end re-platforming of our e-commerce websites to optimize the digital shopping experience across multiple mobile devices, it is unclear whether we will be able to realize the expected return on our investment in these initiatives. If our omni-channel initiatives are not successful, our financial condition, results of operations and ability for future growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to effectively execute our customer strategy.\nAnother of our strategic priorities is to establish a customer data platform and marketing strategy from which we will be able to drive customer initiatives underpinned by data and technology, creating improved segmentation and personalization for an enhanced customer experience both domestically and internationally. This will require significant investment in technology and infrastructure, as well as an increased reliance on leveraging micro and macro influencer networks to increase brand awareness and loyalty through social media and the digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. We must keep up to date with other competitive technology trends, including the use of innovative technology, creative and attractive user interfaces, and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others, which may increase our costs as well as our exposure to legal and reputational liability for online content, but may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting new customers. Any failure on our part to effectively execute on our strategy to enhance our customers\u2019 experience and realize the expected return on our investment in these initiatives could negatively affect sales as well as the reputation of our brands, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nOur plans to improve and expand our product offerings may not be successful, and the implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial, and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our net sales and profitability.\nWe continue to grow our core product offerings and categories. For example, in fiscal 2020, we launched a limited layette capsule and an inclusive sizing collection, and in fiscal 2021, we focused on further expanding our product offerings, particularly within the menswear and soft accessories categories while also entering into select, limited run product and/or services collaborations with a targeted group of external partners. The principal risks to our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings include our failure to maintain our brand identity and image, lack of expertise in the expanded categories and inherent limitations in the utilization of external partners in those categories, increased product liability exposure and general economic conditions, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia. As a result, our expansion into new product categories could be abandoned, cost more than anticipated or divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could negatively impact our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has continued to cause significantly reduced customer traffic and sales in many of our retail locations relative to the same period in fiscal 2019.\nTo date, we have taken various measures in response to COVID-19, as further described in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - COVID-19. However, the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve for example, the occurrence of additional waves of infections in the United States and Asia, including the recent surge in infections by new COVID-19 variants, and national and global uncertainty related to the effectiveness and speed of vaccination acceptance and distribution. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operations includes the following, among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy during these uncertain times;\n\u2022\nsupply chain disruptions resulting from closed factories, reduced workforces and higher labor costs, scarcity of and increased prices for raw materials, scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas, disruptions in the global\ntransportation network, such as temporary port closures, and higher freight costs, including the significant processing delays ongoing at the California ports, which together handle significant portions of our shipments, which resulted in significantly increased freight costs during fiscal 2021;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, caused by lower disposable income levels, travel restrictions, inflation, or other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe build-up of excess inventory as a result of store closures and/or lower consumer demand, including those resulting from potential changes in consumer traffic and shopping preferences, such as consumer willingness to shop at our or our wholesale partners\u2019 retail locations;\n\u2022\nour ability to access capital sources and maintain compliance with our credit facilities, as well as the ability of our key customers, suppliers, and vendors to do the same in regard to their own obligations;\n\u2022\nour ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers;\n\u2022\ntemporary closures and/or re-closures of our stores (including regulatory and/or voluntary re-closures based on the ongoing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic due to further resurgences in COVID-19 cases from variants or otherwise), distribution centers, and corporate facilities for unknown periods of time, as well as those of our wholesale partners;\n\u2022\na large portion of our employee population continuing to work remotely, which could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents;\n\u2022\nthe burden of compliance with strict COVID-19 related rules and guidelines relating to health and safety as well as labor, that are frequently amended and updated; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and employee attention and resources from key business activities and risk management outside of COVID-19 response efforts, including cybersecurity and maintenance of internal controls.\nThere can be no assurance that measures we have taken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic will prove successful or that we will be able to take effective measures against future outbreaks. These and other impacts of COVID-19 may continue to adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions in the U.S. and other parts of the world, including a weakening of the economy and restricted credit markets, can affect consumer confidence and consumer spending patterns.\nThe success of our operations depends on consumer spending. Consumer spending is impacted by a number of factors, including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, customer traffic within shopping and selling environments, business conditions, interest rates and availability of credit and tax rates in the general economy and in the international, regional and local markets in which our products are sold, including those resulting from health epidemics or pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and catastrophic events, such as war (including the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the related governmental and non-governmental global responses to such conflict), terrorist attacks, civil unrest, and other acts of violence. A worsening of the economy may negatively affect consumer and wholesale purchases of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur limited operating experience and brand recognition in international markets may delay our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nWe face risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally, including our efforts to further expand our business in Canada, select European countries, Asia, including China, and the Middle East through company-operated locations, wholesale arrangements as well as with international partners. Our current operations are based largely in the U.S., with international wholesale sales representing approximately 9% of net sales for fiscal 2021. Therefore, we have a limited number of customers and experience in operating outside of the U.S. We also do not have extensive experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of the U.S. and cannot guarantee that we will be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any market outside of the U.S. Many of these markets also have different operational characteristics, including employment and labor regulations, transportation, logistics, real estate (including lease terms) and local reporting or legal requirements, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact on the international markets remains unclear.\nIn fiscal 2021, we commenced a strategy to expand our international retail and e-commerce presence in China and a select list of neighboring countries in Asia via a joint venture arrangement. We are in the initial stages of establishing this relationship and there can be no guarantee that it will be successful. Further, we may face counterparty and/or operational risks as this joint venture arrangement makes us susceptible to the actions of our third-party partner. Our joint venture partner may have views that differ or conflict with ours, such as the timing of new store openings and the pricing of our products, or our partner may become bankrupt, which may as a practical matter subject us to our partner\u2019s liabilities in connection with the joint venture. Although we have sought and generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any investment to permit our objectives to be achieved, we might not be able to take certain actions without the approval of our partners. Reliance on joint venture relationships and our partners exposes us to\nincreased risk that our joint ventures will not be successful and will result in competitive harm to our brand image that could cause our expansion efforts, profitability and results of operations to suffer.\nOur current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.\nWe currently have product licensing agreements for Vince women\u2019s footwear and men\u2019s footwear and, beginning in fiscal year 2022, we will have product licensing agreements for women\u2019s and men\u2019s soft accessories and cold weather goods. In the future, we may enter into select additional licensing arrangements for product offerings which require specialized expertise. In addition, we have entered into select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted certain third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographic areas, and may continue to do so in the future. Although we have taken and will continue to take steps to select potential licensing partners carefully and monitor the activities of our existing licensing partners, such arrangements may not be successful, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under these agreements and the risks applicable to the businesses of our partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner\u2019s ability to obtain capital, exercise operational and financial control over its business, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with suppliers and customers and manage credit and bankruptcy risks, which may be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 and the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Any failure of our licensing arrangements may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. In addition, we license our Vince website domain name from a third-party, renewing on an annual basis. Although the licensor has no termination rights under the domain license agreement, any failure by the licensor to perform its obligations thereunder could materially and adversely impact our operations of our website and our e-commerce business.\nOur ability to continue to have the liquidity necessary to service our debt, meet contractual payment obligations and fund our operations depends on many factors, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, maintain adequate availability under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility or obtain other financing.\nOur ability to timely service our indebtedness, meet contractual payment obligations and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash, either through cash flows from operations or borrowing availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Our recent financial results have been, and our future financial results are expected to be, subject to substantial fluctuations, and will be impacted by business conditions and macroeconomic factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\nIn particular, our ability to continue to meet our obligations is dependent on our ability to generate positive cash flow from a combination of initiatives and any failure to successfully implement these initiatives would require us to implement alternative plans to satisfy our liquidity needs. In the event that we are unable to timely service our debt, meet other contractual payment obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity, seek waivers of or amendments to our contractual obligations for payment, reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations or seek other financing opportunities. There can be no assurance that these options would be readily available to us, and our inability to address our liquidity needs could materially and adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations, including causing defaults under the Term Loan Facility (as defined below), the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility or the Third Lien Credit Facility (as defined below), which could result in all amounts outstanding under those credit facilities becoming immediately due and payable.\nOur operations are restricted by our credit facilities.\nIn August 2018, we entered into an $80,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201c2018 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $27,500 senior secured term loan facility (the \u201c2018 Term Loan Facility\u201d). In November 2019, in connection with the Acquisition, we increased the aggregate commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility to $100,000 by exercising the accordion feature thereunder. The Acquired Businesses became guarantors under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Term Loan Facility and jointly and severally liable for the obligations thereunder. In addition, in December 2020, we entered into a $20,000 subordinated credit facility (the \u201cThird Lien Credit Facility\u201d). In September 2021, we entered into a new $35,000 senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full all outstanding amounts under, and terminate, the 2018 Term Loan Facility. The Acquired Businesses are guarantors under the Term Loan Facility.\nOur credit facilities contain significant restrictive covenants. These covenants may impair our financing and operational flexibility and make it difficult for us to react to market conditions and satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. Specifically, such covenants restrict our ability and, if applicable, the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: incur additional debt; make certain investments and acquisitions; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; use assets as security in other transactions; pay dividends; sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies; guarantee the debt of others; enter into new lines of businesses; make capital expenditures; prepay, redeem, or exchange our debt; and form any joint ventures or subsidiary investments.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our debt obligations, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, and are unable to cure such failure under the terms of our credit facilities, if applicable, we would be required to obtain additional waivers from our lenders to maintain compliance with our debt obligations. If we are unable to obtain any necessary waivers and the debt is accelerated, a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future operating performance would likely result. The terms of our debt obligations and the amount of borrowing availability under our credit facilities may also restrict or delay our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. See \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d under Note 13 \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information.\nIf we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nWe stock our stores, and provide inventory to our wholesale partners, based on our or their estimates of future demand for particular products. Our inventory management and planning team determines the number of pieces of each product that we will order from our manufacturers based upon past sales of similar products, sales trend information and anticipated demand at our suggested retail prices. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in demand for our products or for products of our competitors, product introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to match supply with demand in all cases in the future, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our inability to produce sufficient levels of desirable product or our failure to forecast demand accurately. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products. In fiscal 2020, we recorded a charge of $6,095 associated with inventory write-downs of excess and aged product inventory. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our inventory at a level appropriate for future customer demand.\nOne of our strategic initiatives is to focus on our direct-to-consumer business, which includes opening retail stores in select locations under more favorable and shorter lease terms and operating and maintaining our new and existing retail stores successfully. If we are unable to execute this strategy in a timely manner, or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs part of our strategy to increase focus on our direct-to-consumer business, we continue to seek retail opportunities in targeted streets or malls with desirable size and adjacencies, typically near luxury retailers that we believe are consistent with our key customers\u2019 demographics and shopping preferences, and seek to negotiate more favorable leases including shorter terms. The success of this strategy depends on a number of factors, including the identification of suitable markets and sites, negotiation of acceptable lease terms while securing those favorable locations, including desired term, rent and tenant improvement allowances, and if entering a new market, the timely achievement of brand awareness and proper evaluation of the market particularly for locations with shorter term, affinity and purchase intent in that market, as well as our business condition in funding the opening and operations of stores. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain the successful operation of our retail stores if the areas around our existing retail locations undergo changes that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable, such as economic downturns in the area, changes in demographics and customer preferences, and the closing or decline in popularity of adjacent stores.\nAs of January 29, 2022, we operated 86 stores, including 49 company-operated Vince full-price stores, 10 company-operated Rebecca Taylor full-price stores, 18 company-operated Vince outlet stores and 8 company-operated Rebecca Taylor outlet stores throughout the United States and one company-operated Vince full price store in the United Kingdom. During fiscal 2020, our retail stores were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions and we engaged in discussions with landlords to address the impact of the pandemic. There is no assurance that such closures and the need to engage in additional discussions with landlords will not recur in the future. In addition, following the reopening of our stores, we experienced reduced customer foot-traffic at our stores as compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively affected our business and financial results. Although we plan to continue evaluating our store base consistent with the current operating environment, there can be no assurance that our strategies will effectively address the various prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nDuring fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, we recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $13,026 and $818, respectively, within Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to the impairment of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets of certain retail stores with carrying values that were determined not to be recoverable and exceeded their fair value. We may in the future record further impairments of these assets.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail and office space, are historically subject to long-term non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases, and any failure to make these lease payments when due would likely harm our business, profitability and results of operations.\nWe do not own any of our stores or our offices, including our New York, Los Angeles or Paris offices and showroom spaces, but instead lease all of such space under operating leases. Although a majority of our leases are subject to shorter terms as a result of\nthe implementation of our strategy to pursue shorter lease terms, we still have some leases with initial terms of 10 years, and generally can be extended only for one additional 5-year term. Substantially all of our leases require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. Most of our leases are \u201cnet\u201d leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities, and we generally cannot cancel these leases solely at our option. Additionally, certain of our leases allow the lessor to terminate the lease if we do not achieve a specified gross sales threshold. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve these required thresholds and in the event we are not able to do so, we may be forced to find an alternative store location and may not be successful in doing so. Any loss of our store locations due to underperformance may harm our results of operations, stock price and reputation.\nPayments under these leases account for a significant portion of our selling, general and administrative expenses. For example, as of January 29, 2022, we were a party to 93 operating leases associated with our retail stores and our office and showroom spaces requiring future minimum lease payments of $28,410 in the aggregate through fiscal 2022 and $113,378 thereafter. Any new retail stores leased by us under operating leases will further increase our operating lease expenses, and some of those stores may require significant capital expenditures. We depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facilities or from other sources, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business. In addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term, even after the space is exited or otherwise closed (such as our temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic). Such costs and obligations related to the early or temporary closure of our stores or termination of our leases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among others, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term if we cannot negotiate a mutually acceptable termination payment. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or to find a suitable alternative location, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations or in the case of office leases, incur costs in relocating our office space. In fiscal 2022, four of our existing store leases will expire.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale partners, and the loss of any of these wholesale partners could substantially reduce our total revenue.\nWe historically had and continue to have a small number of wholesale partners who account for a significant portion of our net sales. Our consolidated net sales to the full-price, off-price and e-commerce operations of our largest wholesale partner comprised 20% of our total revenue for fiscal 2021. We do not have formal written agreements with any of our wholesale partners and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major wholesale partners, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to significantly decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Furthermore, due to the concentration of and/or ownership changes in our wholesale partner base, our results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these wholesale partners fails to satisfy its payment obligations to us when due or no longer takes part in the distribution arrangements. These changes could also decrease our opportunities in the market and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale partners. Furthermore, our wholesale partners have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with other wholesalers, and may become unable to continue business with us as they had pre-pandemic. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe acquisition of the Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands, and any other future acquisitions, may not achieve its intended benefits.\nWe face risks associated with our strategy to grow our business through acquisitions of other brands and geographic licensees, such as our acquisition of the Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands in November 2019. For example, on June 16, 2020, we announced that in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended further creation of new product for the Parker brand. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Acquired Businesses recorded impairment charges of $386 and $19,491, respectively, relating to goodwill, tradename, and customer relationship intangible assets. The additional difficulties that we may face that could cause the results of the Acquisition, including any anticipated operational synergies, to not be in line with our expectations include, among others:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our business plan for the combined business or to achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets;\n\u2022\nthe prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues resulting from the integration of logistics, information and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nretaining key customers, suppliers, and employees across brands;\n\u2022\noperating risks inherent in the Acquired Businesses and our business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of the attention and resources of management and resource constraints;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence or other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks, including the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, particularly upon the acquisition of historically privately held businesses, which have not previously been subject to regulations applicable to us.\nOur post-closing recourse with respect to the Acquisition is limited under the related purchase agreement. We obtained and paid for a representation and warranty insurance policy containing customary terms and conditions, which policy is our sole recourse for any losses we may suffer due to breaches of the representations and warranties of CLG and the Acquired Businesses in the purchase agreement other than fraud.\nWe may continue to pursue future acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any such acquisition may subject us to further risks as those described above and could have a material adverse effect on the combined businesses and impact the intended results of such acquisitions.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nIn fiscal 2021 a material weakness continued to exist relating to our internal control over financial reporting which was previously identified in fiscal 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of an entity\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As further described in Part II, Item 9A in this Annual Report, although to date we have made significant progress on our comprehensive remediation plan related to the previously identified material weakness, the material weakness will not be remediated until all necessary internal controls have been implemented, tested and determined to be operating effectively. In addition, we may need to take additional measures to address such material weakness or modify the planned remediation steps, and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weakness will not result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. Moreover, although no additional material weakness was identified in fiscal 2021, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and otherwise materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nFor so long as we remain a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to deliver an annual attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will cease to be a non-accelerated filer if either (i) the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter (our \u201cpublic float\u201d) is $75,000 or more and our annual revenues for the most recently completed fiscal year are $100,000 or more or (ii) our public float is $700,000 or more, in which case we would become subject to the requirement for an annual attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and advisories, including labor and employment, wage and hour, customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, data and privacy protection, and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. If these regulations were violated by our management, employees, vendors, independent manufacturers or partners, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our products, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations. Moreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. It is often difficult for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws and future actions or payments related to such changes could be material to us.\nIntense competition in the apparel and fashion industry could reduce our sales and profitability.\nAs a fashion company, we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign apparel, footwear and accessories manufacturers and retailers. Competition has and may continue to result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, lost market share or failure to grow our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. Some of our competitors have more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. These capabilities of our competitors may allow one or more of them to better withstand downturns in the economy or apparel and fashion industry. Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors which we have seen from time to time, could result in reduced sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nCompetition, along with such other factors as consolidation within the retail industry and changes in consumer spending patterns, could also result in significant pricing pressure and cause the sales environment to be more promotional, as it has been in recent years, impacting our financial results. For instance, we operated through a highly promotional sales environment during fiscal 2020 which had a negative impact on our operating results. If promotional pressure remains intense, either through actions of our competitors or through customer expectations, this may cause a further reduction in our sales and gross margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business depends on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain or enhance our brands, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise, which would harm our business and cause our results of operations to suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as visual merchandising, marketing and advertising, employee training and store operations. Further, our ability to maintain and enhance our brands depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our efforts to be more interactive and inclusive on social media, to have a positive impact on both our brand value and reputation. There is also increased focus on corporate responsibility matters and if we do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly with respect to our practices and initiatives, our reputation could be damaged. Certain of our competitors in the fashion industry have faced adverse publicity surrounding the quality, attributes and performance of their products or company culture. Any or all of our brands may similarly be adversely affected if our public image or reputation is tarnished by failing to maintain high standards for consistent merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns, which could be amplified by social media, may reduce demand for our merchandise. Customer sentiment could also be shaped by our partnerships with artists, influencers and other public figures. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a leading global contemporary group of apparel and accessories brands and to continue to provide high quality products. Moreover, we anticipate that, as our business expands into new markets and further penetrates existing markets, and as the markets in which we operate become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand images, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nIf we lose any key personnel, are unable to attract key personnel, or assimilate and retain our key personnel, we may not be able to successfully operate or grow our business.\nOur continued success is dependent on our ability to attract, assimilate, retain, and motivate qualified management, designers, administrative talent, and sales associates to support existing operations and future growth. Competition for qualified talent in the apparel and fashion industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have greater financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any members of senior management or board of directors or the inability to attract and retain qualified executives or members of our board of directors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we will need to continue to attract, assimilate, retain, and motivate highly talented employees with a range of other skills and experience. Competition for employees in our industry, especially at the store management levels, is intense and we may from time to time experience difficulty in retaining our associates or attracting the additional talent necessary to support the growth of our business. We will also need to attract, assimilate, and retain other professionals across a range of disciplines, including design, production, sourcing, and international business, as we develop new product categories and continue to expand our international presence.\nOur competitive position could suffer if our intellectual property rights are not protected.\nWe believe that our trademarks and designs are of great value. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property. The actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. On the other hand, successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability,\nprevent us from selling some of our products or force us to redesign our products. In addition, we rely on cooperation from third parties with similar trademarks to be able to register our trademarks in jurisdictions in which such third parties have already registered their trademarks. Any of these events could harm our business and cause our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition to suffer.\nOur goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets could become further impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d), goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth fiscal quarter and in an interim period if a triggering event occurs. Determining the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected revenues, EBITDA margins, long-term growth rates, working capital, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded $13,848 of impairment charges relating to goodwill and the tradename intangible assets due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $13,376 relating to goodwill and the tradename intangible assets of the Acquired Businesses. It is possible that our current estimates of future operating results could change adversely and impact the evaluation of the recoverability of the remaining carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and that the effect of such changes could be material. There can be no assurances that we will not be required to record further charges in our financial statements, which would negatively impact our results of operations during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined.\nOur operating results may be subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenue and income from operations.\nThe apparel and fashion industry in which we operate is cyclical and, consequently, our revenues are affected by general economic conditions and the seasonal trends characteristic to the apparel and fashion industry. Purchases of apparel are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, consumer confidence as well as the impact from adverse weather conditions. In addition, fluctuations in the amount of sales in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting direct-to-consumer sales; as such, the financial results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year. Any future seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors to assess the longer-term profitability and strength of our business at any particular point, which could lead to increased volatility in our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology and Security\nSystem or data security issues, such as cyber or malware attacks, as well as other major system failures could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services, and any such disruption could negatively impact our net sales, increase our expenses and harm our reputation.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to system or data security problems, including viruses and bugs as well as security issues created by third-party software and applications, employee errors and malfeasance and other various causes. None of these incidents has resulted in any data or information breaches or any other material impact to our financial results. There is no assurance, however, that we would not be subject to material security problems in the future, including cyber or malware attacks, including as an indirect result of the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and we could incur significant expenses or disruptions of our operations in connection with resulting system failures or data and information breaches. The increased use of smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices, as well as the continued need for a substantial portion of our corporate employees to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, may also heighten these and other operational risks. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions. Furthermore, any security issues that involve the compromise of personal information of our customers or employees could subject us to litigation and/or penalties and harm our reputation, materially and adversely affecting our business and growth. We also do not control our third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future. Lastly, in the case of a disaster affecting our information technology systems, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support our operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are continuing to adopt, optimize and improve our information technology systems, processes, and functions. If these systems, processes, and functions do not operate successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nWe continue to optimize and improve our information technology environment. For example, in fiscal 2021, we completed the roll-out of a new POS system for the Vince brand and in fiscal 2020, we completed the optimization of our warehouse systems as the initial step to implementing our omni-channel strategy as well as the migration of Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands to Vince\u2019s enterprise resource planning system as part of the integration efforts. We plan to progress these strategies, including the front-end re-platforming of our e-commerce system to upgrade both the load speeds of our e-commerce websites as well as create a streamlined customer experience across multiple mobile devices. If we fail in our efforts to continue adopting, optimizing and improving these systems, processes and functions as currently planned, we could incur further disruptions to our business and operations, including lost e-commerce sales, a negative mobile experience for our customers, deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal controls, as well as additional costs to replace those systems and functions.\nFailure to comply with privacy-related obligations, including privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally as well as other legal obligations, could materially adversely affect our business.\nA variety of laws and regulations, in the U.S. and internationally, govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, transfer and security of personally identifiable information and data, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective during fiscal 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020 and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which will become effective January 1, 2023. Since the enactment of the CCPA and CPRA, data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the U.S. states and in the U.S. Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. It is possible that these laws, rules and regulations, which evolve frequently and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, could be interpreted to conflict with our practices. In addition to the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy and data security laws and regulations, any failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with whom we do business to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, or with other obligations to which we may be or become subject, may result in actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any such action would be expensive to defend, could damage our reputation and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain\nProblems with our distribution process could materially harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sale transactions, and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.\nIn the U.S., we rely on distribution facilities operated by third-party logistics providers in California. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale partners and our own direct-to-consumer business depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. Because substantially all of our products are distributed from one state, our operations could be interrupted by labor difficulties, or by floods, fires, earthquakes or other natural disasters and health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, at or near such facility. For example, a majority of our ocean shipments go through the ports in California, which had previously been subject to significant processing delays due to COVID-19 as well as a prior blockage in the Suez Canal, resulting not only in shipment disruptions but also in significantly increased freight costs. We also have warehouses overseas, including in Hong Kong and Belgium, operated by third-party logistics providers, supporting our wholesale orders for customers located primarily in the nearby regions. Disruptions at any of these facilities located outside the U.S. (including disruptions related to COVID-19 and the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia) could also materially and negatively impact our business.\nWe maintain business interruption insurance. These policies, however, may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions to our distribution system. If we encounter problems with any of our distribution processes, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve targeted operating efficiencies could be harmed. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn fiscal 2021, we integrated a majority of the warehouse operations of the Acquired Businesses to those of Vince. If such integration efforts do not continue to progress as planned, our business operations may be significantly disrupted, materially and adversely impacting our business results.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could cause delays and increase costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials, particularly cotton, silk, leather and synthetics used in our manufactured apparel, could have a material adverse effect on cost of sales or our ability to meet customer\ndemands. The prices of fabrics depend largely on the market prices of the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of the raw materials and, in turn, the fabrics used in our apparel may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields, weather patterns, labor costs and changes in oil prices as well as other economic factors, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia. We may not be able to create suitable design solutions that utilize raw materials with attractive prices or, alternatively, to pass higher raw materials prices and related transportation costs on to our customers. We are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials, and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. The ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe extent of our foreign sourcing may adversely affect our business.\nIn fiscal 2021 we worked with more than 40 manufacturers across 10 countries, with 85% of our products produced in China throughout fiscal 2021. A manufacturing contractor\u2019s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of the magnitude of our foreign sourcing, our business is subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in countries or regions, especially Asia and in connection with the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, including heightened terrorism, diplomatic and other security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional or more frequent inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods;\n\u2022\nimposition of regulations, quotas and other trade restrictions relating to imports, including the additional tariffs and bans imposed on certain imports from China (such as those imposed by the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act), as well as other quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries from time to time;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nimposition of increased duties, taxes, tariffs (including, but not limited to, ongoing uncertainty related to the future of U.S. tariffs on products manufactured in China and China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on certain products sourced from the U.S.) and other charges on imports;\n\u2022\nincreases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation, both related and unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic and the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and demand for freight services at a time of reduced ocean freight capacity;\n\u2022\ndisease epidemics and health-related concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in travel restrictions, closed factories, reduced workforces and higher labor costs, scarcity of and increased prices for raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas (such as the recent COVID-19 related governmental restrictions imposed in China);\n\u2022\nlabor union strikes at ports through which our products enter the U.S.;\n\u2022\nlabor shortages in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;\n\u2022\nreduced manufacturing flexibility because of geographic distance between our foreign manufacturers and us, increasing the risk that we may have to mark down unsold inventory as a result of misjudging the market for a foreign-made product; and\n\u2022\nviolations by foreign contractors of labor and wage standards and resulting adverse publicity.\nIf these risks limit or prevent us from manufacturing products in any significant international market, prevent us from acquiring products from foreign suppliers, or significantly increase the cost of our products, our operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers are found or alternative markets are developed, which could negatively and significantly impact our business. While we may be able to shift our sourcing options to avoid any negative macroenvironmental impact of a particular region such as China, executing such a shift would be time consuming and would be difficult or impracticable for many products and may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs and/or may negatively impact the quality of our products. Any increase in the prices of our products and/or decline in the quality of our products could in turn negatively impact the demand for our products.\nOur reliance on independent manufacturers could cause delays or quality issues which could damage customer relationships.\nWe use independent manufacturers to assemble or produce all of our products, whether inside or outside the U.S. We are dependent on the ability of these independent manufacturers to adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity. Because we do not control these independent manufacturers, they may not continue to provide products that are consistent with our standards. We receive from time to time shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards or products that are damaged during shipment as they were not properly packed. Failures such as these in our quality control program may result in diminished product quality, which in turn may result in increased order cancellations and returns, decreased consumer demand for our products, or product recalls, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations and financial condition. In addition, products that fail to meet our standards, or other unauthorized products, could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge. This could materially harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe generally do not have long-term written agreements with any independent manufacturers. As a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. Our top five manufacturers accounted for the production of approximately 59% of our finished products during fiscal 2021. Supply disruptions from these manufacturers (or any of our other manufacturers) could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands if we are unable to source suitable replacement materials at acceptable prices or at all. Moreover, alternative manufacturers, if available, may not be able to provide us with products or services of a comparable quality, at an acceptable price or on a timely basis. We may also, from time to time, make a decision to enter into a relationship with a new manufacturer. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other responsible and/or ethical business practices. There can be no assurance that there will not be a disruption in the supply of our products from independent manufacturers or that any new manufacturer will be successful in producing our products in a manner we expected, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which initially significantly impacted and is continuing to impact the regions in which many of these manufacturers are located. During fiscal 2017, certain manufacturers demanded accelerated payment terms or prepayments as a condition to delivering finished goods to us, which required us to take various steps to address those requests to avoid disruptions in product deliveries and to return to normal terms. There can be no assurance that such demands would not recur in the future.\nIf our independent manufacturers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand images could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nWe have established operating guidelines which promote responsible and ethical business practices such as fair wage practices, compliance with child labor laws and other local laws. While we monitor compliance with those guidelines, we do not control our independent manufacturers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines. From time to time, our audit results have revealed a lack of compliance in certain respects, including with respect to local labor, safety, and environmental laws. Other fashion companies have faced criticism after highly publicized incidents or compliance issues have occurred or been exposed at factories producing their products. To the extent our manufacturers do not bring their operations into compliance with such laws or resolve material issues identified in any of our audit results, we may face similar criticism and negative publicity. In addition, other fashion companies have encountered organized boycotts of their products in such situations. If we, or other companies in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand images, stock price and results of operations. In addition, a lack of demonstrated compliance by our suppliers could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations. Furthermore, expectations of ethical business practices continually evolve, may be substantially more demanding than applicable legal requirements and are driven in part by legal developments and by diverse groups active in publicizing and organizing public responses to perceived ethical shortcomings. Accordingly, we cannot predict how expectations of ethical business practices might develop in the future and cannot be certain that our guidelines would satisfy all parties who are active in monitoring and publicizing perceived shortcomings in labor and other business practices worldwide.\nRisks Related to Our Structure and Ownership\nWe are required to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders 85% of certain tax benefits and could be required to make substantial cash payments in which our stockholders will not participate.\nWe entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the Pre-IPO Stockholders (as defined therein) in connection with the IPO and Restructuring Transactions which closed on November 27, 2013. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be obligated to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders an amount equal to 85% of the cash savings in federal, state and local income tax realized by us by virtue of our future use of the federal, state and local net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) held by us as of November 27, 2013, together with section 197 intangible deductions (collectively, the \u201cPre-IPO Tax Benefits\u201d). \u201cSection 197 intangible deductions\u201d means amortization deductions with respect to certain amortizable intangible assets which are held by us and our subsidiaries immediately after November 27, 2013. Cash tax savings generally will be computed by comparing our actual federal, state and local income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had such Pre-IPO Tax Benefits not been available to us. Assuming the federal, state and local corporate income tax rates presently in effect, no material change in applicable tax law and no limitation on our ability to use the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), the estimated cash benefit of the full use of these Pre-IPO Tax Benefits as of January 29, 2022 would be approximately $38,327, of which 85%, or approximately $32,578 plus accrued interest, is potentially payable to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. As of January 29, 2022, $0, plus accrued interest, is currently outstanding. However, the Tax Receivable Agreement could require us to make substantial cash payments in the future. Payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future and any future limitations that may be imposed on our ability to use the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits, and estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. If we determine in the future that the estimate should be revised, we would be required to\neither recognize additional liability related to tax benefits expected to be utilized or derecognize liability relating to tax benefits no longer expected to be utilized, which could result in material modifications to our financial statements.\nAlthough we are not aware of any issue that would cause the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) to challenge any tax benefits arising under the Tax Receivable Agreement, the affiliates of Sun Capital will not reimburse us for any payments previously made if such benefits subsequently are disallowed, although the amount of any tax savings subsequently disallowed will reduce any future payment otherwise owed to the Pre-IPO Stockholders. For example, if our determinations regarding the applicability (or lack thereof) and amount of any limitations on the NOLs under Section 382 of the Code were to be successfully challenged by the IRS after payments relating to such NOLs had been made to the Pre-IPO Stockholders, we would not be reimbursed by the Pre-IPO Stockholders and our recovery would be limited to the extent of future payments (if any) otherwise remaining under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, in such circumstances we could make payments to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual cash tax savings.\nBecause Vince Holding Corp. is a holding company with no operations of its own, its ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is dependent on the ability of Vince, LLC and its subsidiaries to make distributions to it. To the extent that we need funds, for such payment or otherwise, and Vince, LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. To the extent that Vince Holding Corp. is unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid, which could adversely affect our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in periods in which such payments are made.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the Pre-IPO Stockholders may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits.\nUpon the election of an affiliate of Sun Capital to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement pursuant to a change in control (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) or upon our election to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, all of our payment and other obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be accelerated and will become due and payable. Additionally, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that in the event that we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement by operation of law as a result of the rejection of the Tax Receivable Agreement in a case commenced under Title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d), then all of our payment and other obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be accelerated and will become due and payable. In the case of any such acceleration, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to 85% of the present value of the tax savings represented by any portion of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits for which payment under the Tax Receivable Agreement has not already been made.\nAlthough as of January 29, 2022, we estimate that we would not be required to make any payment under the Tax Receivable Agreement, in the future, such payments could be substantial and could exceed our actual cash tax savings from the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash available or that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d controlled by investment funds advised by affiliates of Sun Capital, whose interests in our business may be different from yours.\nAffiliates of Sun Capital owned approximately 71% of our outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2022. As such, affiliates of Sun Capital will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over our reporting and corporate management and affairs, and will be able to control virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval. For so long as affiliates of Sun Capital own 30% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, Sun Cardinal, LLC, an affiliate of Sun Capital, will have the right to designate a majority of our board of directors.\nAffiliates of Sun Capital control actions to be taken by us, our board of directors and our stockholders, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The directors designated by affiliates of Sun Capital have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d does not apply to Sun Capital or its affiliates, or any of our directors who are associates of, or affiliated with, Sun Capital, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our partners or customers. It is possible that the interests of Sun Capital and its affiliates may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you. For example, Sun Capital may have different tax positions from other stockholders, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets, whether and when we should incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder.\nAny disputes that arise between us and St. Louis, LLC, or between us and Kellwood, which is now an unaffiliated entity, with respect to our past relationships, could materially harm our business operations.\nDisputes may arise between St. Louis, LLC and us and/or between us and Kellwood with respect to any past transitional services provided under the Shared Services Agreement between Vince, LLC and Kellwood in a number of areas relating to our operations or indemnification obligations. Any such dispute, if not resolved, could materially harm our business operations, particularly as we may not obtain adequate recovery of damages from St. Louis, LLC, which has now been dissolved, and Kellwood, which is now an unaffiliated entity.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and intend to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d We will remain a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d until the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $250,000 or more and annual revenue as of our most recently completed fiscal year is $100,000 or more, or the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $700,000 or more, regardless of annual revenue.", "PERMNO": 14296, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "VNCE"}
