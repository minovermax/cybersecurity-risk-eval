{"cik": "1070698", "company": "Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A:\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risk factors described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC, such as our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any public announcements we make from time to time. If any of these risks actually occur, it may materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we think are immaterial may also materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment.\nRisks Associated with Commercialization and Product Development\nOur revenues currently depend entirely on the commercial success of our lead drug, PROCYSBI, for the management of nephropathic cystinosis.\nPROCYSBI is our only product currently approved for marketing, and as a result, our revenue and operating results substantially depend on the commercial success of PROCYSBI. We commenced marketing for PROCYSBI in the United States in June 2013 and Europe in April 2014. We did not have prior experience commercializing therapeutics. In the United States, we are permitted to market PROCYSBI only for the management of nephropathic cystinosis in adults and children six years and older. In September 2013, we received marketing authorization from the European Commission, or EC, to commercialize PROCYSBI for the treatment of proven nephropathic cystinosis in the Economic European Area, or EEA. However, we only recently commenced commercial sales of PROCYSBI in select countries in Europe, and have no assurance of securing reimbursement and subsequently launching in additional countries in the EEA. We believe that our results of operations and, in particular, net product sales of PROCYSBI will affect the trading price of our common stock substantially. If PROCYSBI sales do not meet expectations, our stock price may fluctuate, including a potential and possibly significant decrease.\nThe successful commercialization of PROCYSBI will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to provide acceptable evidence of the safety and efficacy of PROCYSBI;\n\u00b7 compliance with regulatory requirements, including fulfilling post-approval commitments;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain approval by regulatory agencies in other countries, including appropriate product labeling;\n\u00b7 the effect of current and future healthcare laws;\n\u00b7 the manufacture and supply of adequate quantities of PROCYSBI in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, as needed to meet commercial demand;\n\u00b7 adequate coverage and reimbursement for PROCYSBI from commercial health plans and government health programs, which we refer to collectively as third-party payors;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain acceptable prices in EEA countries and other select territories, including reimbursement at the country-specific price;\n\u00b7 limitations or warnings currently contained in or as may later be required in approved labeling and the breadth of product labeling or product insert requirements;\n\u00b7 our ability to enter into agreements with wholesalers, distributors and pharmacies on commercially reasonable terms; and\n\u00b7 the development and maintenance of intellectual property and other product protection for PROCYSBI.\nIf we fail to grow sales of PROCYSBI in existing markets or to successfully commercialize PROCYSBI in other countries within a reasonable time period, we may never become profitable and may be unable to sustain our business, our business, and results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to generate significant product sales from PROCYSBI is dependent upon market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient families, third-party payors and the healthcare community.\nPROCYSBI may not attain or maintain market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient families, third-party payors or the healthcare community compared to the current standard of care and our competitors. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate significant product sales of PROCYSBI will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the relative efficacy, safety, availability and ease of administration of alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the price of our product, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the timing of market introduction of our product relative to competitive drugs;\n\u00b7 the nature of publicity related to our products relative to the publicity related to our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects of PROCYSBI;\n\u00b7 continued patient adherence to therapy;\n\u00b7 availability of coverage from third-party payors;\n\u00b7 provision of affordable out-of-pocket costs to patients and/or other programs to ensure patient access to PROCYSBI; and\n\u00b7 the identification of currently diagnosed and undiagnosed patients and the continued growth of the cystinosis market.\nOur efforts to educate patients, physicians, parents, the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of PROCYSBI may require significant resources and may not be successful. If PROCYSBI does not achieve and maintain significant market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient families, third-party payors or the healthcare community, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nThe amount of our product sales of PROCYSBI in the EEA is dependent in part upon the pricing and reimbursement guidelines adopted in each of the EEA countries, which may not be at acceptable levels.\nWe currently sell PROCYSBI in select EEA countries at the German price. One or more EEA countries may not support our anticipated pricing and reimbursement levels for PROCYSBI, particularly in light of the budget crises faced by a number of countries and third-party payors in the EEA, which would negatively affect revenues from PROCYSBI. The pricing and reimbursement process in EEA countries can be lengthy and involved, and we do not have significant experience with this process. Failure to timely complete the pricing and reimbursement process in the EEA countries will delay our ability to further market PROCYSBI and our ability to derive revenues from that region.\nPROCYSBI is, and any other future product candidates, if approved, will be, subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements and continued regulatory review, which will result in significant expense, and we may be subject to penalties and litigation if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience problems with our products.\nEven after we achieve regulatory approvals, we are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to our manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, adverse event reporting, dispensation, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, ongoing maintenance of product registration and continued compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, good clinical practices, or GCPs, good distribution practices, or GDPs, and good laboratory practices, or GLPs. If we, our products or product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our products or product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7 impose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, suspend or withdraw product approvals, revoke necessary licenses or suspend product reimbursement;\n\u00b7 impose injunctions, suspensions or revocations of necessary approvals or other licenses;\n\u00b7 issue warning letters, show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available;\n\u00b7 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u00b7 refuse to permit drugs or precursor chemicals to be imported or exported to or from the United States;\n\u00b7 suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u00b7 seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u00b7 commence criminal investigations and prosecutions.\nMoreover, existing regulatory approvals and any future regulatory approvals that we obtain will be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, the conditions of approval, requirements for potentially costly, post-market testing and requirements for surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In the EEA, the advertising and promotion of pharmaceuticals is strictly regulated. The direct-to-consumer promotion of prescription pharmaceuticals is not permitted, and some countries of the EEA require the notification and/or prior authorization of promotional or advertising materials directed at healthcare professionals. The FDA, EMA, EC and other authorities in the EEA countries strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, and our product labeling, advertising and promotion are subject to continuing regulatory review. Physicians nevertheless may prescribe our product to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label or that is off-label. Positive clinical trial results in any of our RP103 programs increase the risk that immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate may be used off-label in those indications in certain geographic areas due to the lower cost of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. If we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, we may be subject to significant sanctions, civil and criminal fines and injunctions prohibiting us from engaging in specified promotional conduct.\nIn addition, engaging in improper promotion of our products for off-label uses in the United States can subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes. These false claims statutes in the United States include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Growth in false claims litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay civil money penalties, settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.\nThe regulations, policies or guidance of regulatory agencies may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. For example, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires the FDA to issue new guidance describing its policy regarding internet and social media promotion of regulated medical products, and the FDA may soon specify new restrictions on this type of promotion. In January 2014, the FDA released draft guidance on how drug companies can fulfill their regulatory requirements for post-marketing submission of interactive promotional media, and though the guidance provided insight into how the FDA views a company\u2019s responsibility for certain types of social media promotion, there remains a substantial amount of uncertainty. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from pending or future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are unable to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our drugs, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to expand the use of RP103 and receive regulatory approval for any other indication or for other product candidates, we may delay or terminate some of our product development activities, which would adversely affect the long term value of RP103 or other product candidates and our growth prospects.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products, among other things, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and by similar foreign regulatory governmental entities. We are not permitted to market any of our drug product candidates unless we obtain and maintain appropriate pre-market approvals from regulatory agencies in each of the markets in which we intend to market our products. Once approved, we may only market our products for the specific uses that are reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. A product\u2019s approved labeling may contain limitations or warnings or may be for different patient populations or for fewer or more limited indications than what we requested in our pre-market approval application, which could result in reimbursement complications, limit access for intended use or limit the commercial profile of the drug. In the United States, we are permitted to market the active pharmaceutical ingredient of RP103 in the formulation of a final drug product and in the doses approved under the brand name PROCYSBI only for the management of nephropathic cystinosis in adults and children six years and older under the brand name PROCYSBI. We are permitted to market PROCYSBI in the EEA as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of proven nephropathic cystinosis. We do not have approval of RP103 in any other market nor for any other disease indication. There can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approval for any other uses for PROCYSBI or any of our other product candidates or that, even if we obtained additional approvals, we would be able to commercialize the product candidates successfully.\nA new drug application, or NDA, submitted to the FDA, or a marketing authorization application, or MAA, submitted to the European Medicine Agency, or the EMA, must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls. This information must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the applicable product candidate for the management of each individual indication to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority. Obtaining approval of an NDA, MAA or any other filing for marketing authorization in a foreign country is an extensive, expensive and uncertain process. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. The FDA, EC or other regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of RP103 or our future drug product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials; they may change the requirements for approval even after having reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate that product candidates have adequate clinical and other benefits or adequate safety profiles, even if they achieve their specified endpoints in clinical trials; or they may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials and require that we conduct additional trials;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting (or equivalent, if required) in a timely manner, or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the regulatory agency require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical trials; approval may also be contingent on a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which limits the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require additional preclinical or clinical studies or other data prior to granting approval, and we may not be able to generate the required data on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or in the facilities of our third-party suppliers and/or contract manufacturers or may require us to manufacture additional validation batches or change our process, specifications or third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers; and\n\u00b7 we may not be able to validate our manufacturing process to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities, or they may not agree with our plan for potential retrospective validation.\nIf we fail to gain regulatory approval for RP103 for other indications or our other future drug product candidates, we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our research product development programs, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not have internal manufacturing capabilities. Throughout most of 2015, we expect to continue to rely on a single source supplier for our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and a single third-party manufacturer for the conversion to finished drug product. We also rely on third parties for the distribution and pharmaceutical services of PROCYSBI in the United States and the EEA. If we are unable to rely on these third parties, our revenue will be delayed or diminished and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and currently lack the in-house capability to manufacture PROCYSBI or RP103. As a result, we currently contract with external contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for commercial and clinical quantities of PROCYSBI and RP103 for the indications under development. We rely on a single source supplier for our cysteamine API. While we have procured additional manufacturing support with a second supplier for clinical supply of our finished drug product, for the majority of 2015, we will continue to rely on a single third-party manufacturer for supply of finished products until the second supplier can be validated and provide finished product. Our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of PROCYSBI and RP103 is constrained by limited supplies of raw materials and the limited capacity and output of these third parties. Furthermore, any reduction, delay or interruption in our supply of API from the single source supplier or of our supply of finished goods from our CMO, together with any additional required efforts to identify and qualify alternative sources of API supply, could result in significant additional operating costs, interruptions in product supply, delays in sales of PROCYSBI and delays in developing RP103 for additional indications. In addition, supply arrangements from alternative sources not currently under contract may not be available on acceptable economic terms, if at all.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production to commercial requirements. Difficulties may arise related to internal processes, production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality control testing, sourcing scarcities, resource constraints, equipment problems, shortages of qualified personnel, labor disputes, severe weather events, unstable political environments or financial difficulties at foreign facilities, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Manufacturers may breach their agreements with us or may terminate or decline to renew their agreements with us, whether due to our breach of the relevant agreements or based on their own business priorities. In addition, due to our small patient population, the manufacture of our drug may be given lower prioritization on the production line if manufacturing prioritization is decided by scale.\nManufacturers and suppliers are subject to regulatory requirements covering, among other things, manufacturing, process controls, testing, quality control and record keeping and are subject to ongoing inspections by regulatory agencies. We have no direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturing parties to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel, and while final outputs are reviewed by our own internal quality control, we depend on our third-party supplier and manufacturers for compliance with the FDA\u2019s current cGMP requirements and other FDA requirements, the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s regulations and other rules and regulations prescribed by applicable non-U.S. regulatory authorities. If our contract manufacturing partners cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities, and we may experience long delays and interruptions to our manufacturing supply and increased costs.\nPursuant to ongoing obligations from our NDA for PROCYSBI, we are required to collect and submit data to the FDA regularly regarding our currently observed clinical and commercial product profile and overall product safety assessment. While our current inventory falls within the specifications used during our clinical trials that support our NDA in the U.S. and marketing authorization application, or MAA, in Europe, we are currently evaluating our product specifications limit in light of new analytic data characterizing impurities and related substances and intend to submit requests to regulators in the U.S. and Europe for approval of revised PROCYSBI and RP103 specifications. We expect that there will continue to be intermittent delays in manufacturing or release of drug product as these issues are identified and addressed, and future release of drug product may depend on agreement of those and future specifications updates. If regulators reject our proposal to modify the specifications or require additional data to support the updated specifications, our ability to release drug product may be limited. Although we have stock of PROCYSBI on hand and believe we have enough PROCYSBI inventory to meet our near-term commercial needs in both the United States and the EEA, if there are material delays in the regulators\u2019 review and potential approval, we may experience an inventory shortfall, which would have a material adverse effect on sales of PROCYSBI.\nIf we or our third-party suppliers and manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could experience significant delays or interruptions to our manufacturing supply that may result in the delay or suspension of our pre-clinical or clinical trials. In addition, a regulatory agency could issue warning letters or untitled letters, seek an injunction, impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines, suspend or withdraw regulatory approval, suspend any ongoing clinical trials, refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications, suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements, seize or detain products or request that we initiate a product recall.\nWe also rely on a third-party logistics provider and specialty pharmacy to distribute PROCYSBI to patients in the United States and to pharmacies in the EEA and to collect from insurance companies and government agencies in the United States and from pharmacies in the EEA. Our ability to collect from a particular logistics provider is not only subject to such provider\u2019s credit worthiness but is also dependent, in part, on its ability to arrange for full reimbursement from third-party payors. The outsourcing of our distribution function is complex, and we may experience difficulties that could reduce, delay or stop shipments of PROCYSBI. If we encounter such distribution problems, and we are unable to quickly enter into a similar agreement with another specialty distributor on substantially similar terms, if at all, the distribution of PROCYSBI could become disrupted, resulting in reduced revenues, healthcare provider dissatisfaction and/or patient dissatisfaction, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our reputation would be harmed, revenues from sales of our products would be delayed or diminished and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nIf serious adverse side effects become associated with PROCYSBI, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nThe prescribing information for PROCYSBI includes several warnings relating to observed adverse reactions of cysteamine bitartrate usage. The FDA may require products approved under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, to bear the same or similar warning statements as the reference product used in the approval. We expect to update adverse reactions listed in the prescribing information based on continued commercial use and additional clinical trials. If additional adverse reactions emerge, or if there is a pattern of severe or persistent previously observed side effects in the relevant patient populations, the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory agencies could modify or revoke our marketing approval, require us to modify our label or require us to suspend production, require a product recall, or we may choose to withdraw PROCYSBI from the market. Regulatory authorities could also require us to change the way the product is administered or modify the product in some other way, or they could require us to conduct additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. If this were to occur, we may be unable to maintain marketing approval in our approved indications and/or obtain marketing approval in other indications. In addition, patients or their representatives may bring claims against us alleging serious adverse side effects or harm suffered as a result of use of PROCYSBI. Any such side effects or related claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also the risk factor titled \u201cWe may be subject to product liability claims.\u201d\nIf we fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy in our preclinical studies or clinical trials or to keep to the terms of a product development program, our future business prospects for these drug product candidates will be materially adversely affected.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement. The outcome of clinical trials is uncertain, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing for RP103 or pre-clinical or clinical testing for any of our other product candidates could significantly affect our product development costs and business plan.\nPreclinical studies involve testing in appropriate multiple non-human disease models to demonstrate efficacy and safety. Regulatory agencies evaluate these data carefully as part of their determination whether to authorize clinical testing in humans. If certain preclinical data reveal potential safety issues or if the results are inconsistent with an expectation of the drug product candidate\u2019s efficacy in humans, the regulatory agencies may require additional testing before allowing human clinical trials. This additional testing will increase program expenses and extend timelines. There are many potential preclinical models to test for different disease states, and we could fail to choose the best preclinical model to determine proof of concept, safety and efficacy of our drug product candidates. We may decide to suspend further testing on our drug product candidates or technologies if, in the judgment of our management and advisors, the preclinical test results do not support further development.\nFollowing successful preclinical testing, drug product candidates must be tested in a clinical development program to provide data on safety and efficacy in humans prior to becoming eligible for product approval and licensure by regulatory agencies. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Clinical trials may also be delayed or repeated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or unforeseen complications in testing. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate with statistical significance that our drug product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure may cause us to abandon a drug product candidate and may delay development of other drug product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our preclinical testing or clinical trials will delay the filing of relevant marketing applications with regulatory agencies and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our drug product candidates and generate revenues from related products.\nThe rate of completion of any clinical trials will be dependent upon, among other factors, the rate of patient enrollment. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial, the nature of the disease or medical condition being studied, the availability of alternative therapies and drugs, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study. Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and delays. In addition, because many of our clinical trials involve small patient populations, the results of these early clinical trials may not be indicative of future results.\nUnder the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA seeks to respond to NDAs within ten months of the filing date, but this timeframe is often extended. For example, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a \u201cfast track product.\u201d Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This \u201crolling review\u201d is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. In addition, FDASIA established a new category of drugs referred to as \u201cbreakthrough therapies,\u201d which are defined as drugs intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. In the future, we may request breakthrough designation or fast track designation from the FDA for our other drug product candidates, but we there can be no assurance that we will obtain such designations. Moreover, even if we obtain breakthrough designation or fast track designation from the FDA, the designations do not guarantee that the FDA will approve our NDA, that the development program or review timeline will ultimately be shorter than if we had not obtained the designations or that the FDA will not request additional information, including additional clinical studies, during its review.\nWe do not know whether our investigational new drug, or IND, applications for future products or the protocols for any future clinical trials will be accepted by the FDA. We do not know if our clinical trials will begin or be completed on schedule or at all. Even if completed, we do not know if these trials will produce clinically meaningful results sufficient to support an application for marketing approval. The commencement and completion of our planned clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u00b7 a limited number of, and competition for, suitable patients with particular types of disease for enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delays or failures in obtaining regulatory clearance to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 delays or failures in obtaining sufficient clinical materials;\n\u00b7 inability to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u00b7 delays or failures in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites;\n\u00b7 inability of our clinical research organizations, or CROs, or other third-party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u00b7 inability by us, our CROs or their employees to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with all applicable FDA, Drug Enforcement Administration or other regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u00b7 lack of efficacy during, or other unfavorable results from, clinical trials or pre-clinical studies;\n\u00b7 discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by study participants or other unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 failure of patients to complete the clinical trial, or inability or unwillingness of patients or medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols;\n\u00b7 inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u00b7 regulatory action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; and\n\u00b7 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of any unforeseen costs.\nIn addition, changes in applicable regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to Institutional Review Boards for reexamination, which may affect the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nSales of our products outside of the United States are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing approvals. Even if the FDA and EC grant marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or manufacturing and control requirements. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In many cases, the price that we propose to charge for our products is also subject to approval by individual countries before we can launch our product candidates in those countries. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals, complying with foreign regulatory requirements and gaining approved pricing and reimbursement could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Further, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others.\nAny delay in our preclinical or clinical programs or the failure to demonstrate safety or efficacy in our clinical trials would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain orphan drug or other regulatory exclusivity for PROCYSBI or to obtain and maintain exclusivity for our orphan drug product candidates, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions, possibly at lower prices, and our revenues will be significantly reduced.\nPROCYSBI has received marketing approval from the FDA for the management of nephropathic cystinosis in adults and children six years and older and seven years of market exclusivity as an orphan drug in the United States. PROCYSBI has also received approval as an orphan medicinal product for the management of proven nephropathic cystinosis and 10 years of market exclusivity in the EEA. As part of our business strategy, we intend to develop RP103, and potentially other drugs, for additional therapeutic indications that may be eligible for FDA and EMA orphan drug designation.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of less than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years, plus an additional six months if designated for a pediatric indication.\nIn the EU, the EMA\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or if the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). In addition, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition as well as when it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product without incentives. An EU orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduced fees or fee waivers, and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. An applicant must request orphan drug designation before submitting an application for marketing approval.\nOrphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\nEven though we have been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and in the EU prior to the approval of RP103 for the potential treatment of HD, and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our future drug product candidates, we may not fulfill the criteria for exclusivity, or we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any orphan indication. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a particular product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may also be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective, if a subsequent product is deemed clinically superior or if the manufacturer is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of the drug.\nBecause the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our drug products may be particularly limited, orphan drug designation is especially important for our eligible products and we plan to rely on the orphan exclusivity period to maintain a competitive position. However, if we do not obtain and/or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for RP103, or if our drug products do not have strong patent protection, our competitors may sell the same drug to treat the same condition, possibly at lower prices, and our revenues will be reduced. Also, without strong patent protection, competitors may sell a generic version of our products upon the expiration of orphan exclusivity if our patent position is not upheld.\nIf our competitors succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective than our own, or if scientific developments change our understanding of the potential scope and utility of our drug product candidates, then our technologies and future drug product candidates may be rendered less competitive.\nWe face significant competition from industry participants that are pursuing technologies similar to those that we are pursuing and are developing pharmaceutical products that are competitive with PROCYSBI or our drug product candidates. Many of the pharmaceutical companies in areas competitive with us have greater capital resources, larger overall research and development staff and facilities and a longer history in drug discovery, development, regulatory approval, manufacturing and marketing than we do. With these additional resources and experience, our competitors may be able to respond to rapid and significant technological changes in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries faster than we can.\nWe expect that the technologies associated with biotechnology research and development will continue to develop rapidly. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Rapid technological development, as well as new scientific developments, may result in our compounds, drug products, drug product candidates or processes becoming obsolete before we can recover any or all of the expenses incurred to develop them. For example, changes in our understanding of the appropriate population of patients who should be treated with a targeted therapy like those we are developing may limit the drug\u2019s market potential if it is subsequently demonstrated that only certain subsets of patients should be treated with the targeted therapy.\nBecause the target patient populations for PROCYSBI and some of our drug product candidates are small, we must achieve significant market share and obtain relatively high per-patient prices for our products to achieve meaningful gross margins.\nPROCYSBI and our clinical development of RP103 target diseases with small patient populations, including cystinosis and Huntington\u2019s Disease, or HD, respectively. To successfully commercialize a drug product for these indications, we must identify patients and a targeted prescriber base for the drug product. Due to small patient populations, we believe that we would need to have significant market penetration to achieve meaningful revenues. In addition, the per-patient prices at which we sell PROCYSBI and RP103 for these indications will need to be relatively high in order for us to generate an appropriate return for the investment in these product development programs and to achieve meaningful gross margins. Patients who discontinue therapy or do not fill prescriptions are not easily replaced by new patients because of the limited patient population. There can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain or maintain sufficient market share or per-patient prices. Because the potential target populations are very small, even if we obtain significant market share for PROCYSBI and RP103, we may never achieve profitability despite obtaining such significant market share.\nOur development strategy for RP103 depends upon the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and effectiveness of cysteamine bitartrate based on data not developed by us but upon which the FDA may rely in reviewing any future NDA.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments added to the FDCA Section 505(b)(2), which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Under this statutory provision, the FDA may rely, for purposes of approving an NDA, on safety and effectiveness data not developed by the filer of the NDA. We also plan to submit an NDA for RP103 for approval of other indications under Section 505(b)(2), and if we are able to submit those NDAs, they will rely, in part, on the FDA\u2019s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for cysteamine bitartrate. Even though we may be able to take advantage of Section 505(b)(2) to support potential U.S. approval for these additional product candidates, the FDA may require us to perform additional studies or measurements to support approval. In addition, the FDA\u2019s interpretation and use of Section 505(b)(2) has been controversial and has previously been challenged in court, though without a definitive ruling on the propriety of the FDA\u2019s approach. Future challenges, including a direct challenge to the approval of our products and product candidates, may be possible and, if successful, could limit or eliminate our ability to rely on the Section 505(b)(2) pathway for the approval of RP103 and our other product candidates. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and launch of any future product candidates and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs in the United States, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, as administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and other federal and state government pricing programs in the United States, and we may participate in additional government pricing programs in the future. These programs generally require us to pay rebates or otherwise provide discounts to government payors in connection with drugs, including PROCYSBI, that are dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. In some cases, such as with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the government agencies that administer the programs. Pricing and rebate calculations are complex, vary among products and programs, and are often subject to interpretation by governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The terms, scope and complexity of these government pricing programs change frequently. Responding to current and future changes may increase our costs and the complexity of compliance will be time consuming.\nIn addition, the Office of Inspector General has recently increased its focus on the methodologies used by manufacturers to calculate average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price, or BP, to assess manufacturer compliance with reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. We are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data and for any overcharging of government payors. For example, failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP and BP data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the submission is late beyond the due date. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify overpayments could result in allegations against us under the Federal False Claims Act and other laws and regulations.\nAny required refunds to the U.S. government or responding to a government investigation or enforcement action would be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the event that the CMS were to terminate our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare for our covered outpatient drugs.\nPressure from third-party payor coverage, reimbursement and pricing policies may impair our customers\u2019 ability to be reimbursed for PROCYSBI and our other future product candidates at adequate prices or on adequate terms, which may in turn materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket acceptance and sales of PROCYSBI and any product candidates that we may develop will depend in large part on third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States, the EEA countries and other key international markets. The continuing efforts of governmental and other third-party payors to contain, reduce or shift the costs of healthcare through various means, including an increased emphasis on managed care and attempts to limit or regulate the price of medicinal products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, may result in downward pressure on pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our product sales and results of operations. Moreover, because private health insurers and other third-party payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of government payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, cost-containment measures under these programs play a particularly significant role in the reimbursement landscape. The government programs relevant to our products include, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7 the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, under which manufacturers must report pricing information and pay rebates in order for their drug products to be covered under state Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7 the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B Drug Pricing Program, under which manufacturers must offer discounts to certain healthcare organizations that care for underserved populations;\n\u00b7 the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Federal Supply Schedule pricing program, under which manufacturers agree to offer drugs to certain governmental providers at reduced rates;\n\u00b7 the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program, under which manufacturers must agree to honor certain discounted prices, specifically Federal Ceiling Prices under the Veterans Health Care Act, as a condition for placement in the Department of Defense uniform formulary; and\n\u00b7 the Medicare Part D program, under which manufacturers contract with plan sponsors to offer certain outpatient drugs to Medicare beneficiaries.\nIn addition, in the United States, third-party payors often develop cost containment measures using policies that specifically target specialty products and high-cost drugs. For example, formulary placements may be less favorable for brand and higher-costing drugs, which may result in, among other things, greater out-of-pocket costs to patients. PROCYSBI often is subject to such measures, and similar future policies addressing such cost-containment measures may also affect PROCYSBI.\nFurther, third-party payors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, AMP or actual acquisition cost, and for cost-benefit analyses with comparable drugs. Although the changes to reimbursement methodologies are generally intended to limit payment increases, it is difficult to project the impact of these and other alternative reimbursement methodologies on the willingness of payors to reimburse PROCYSBI and any product candidates that we may develop. To date, PROCYSBI generally has been covered and reimbursed in the United States and the select countries we have entered in Europe, but we do not know whether third-party payors will continue to cover and reimburse PROCYSBI in these markets or at the level PROCYSBI is currently covered, will reimburse PROCYSBI in other EEA countries or will reimburse RP103 and our future products until we enter into payor negotiations. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nLegislative changes may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize PROCYSBI or any other product candidate that we develop and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that restrict or regulate post-approval activities. The changes may affect our ability to sell PROCYSBI or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval at adequate prices.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d was adopted. This law intends to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act, among other things:\n\u00b7 increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u00b7 revised the definition of AMP for reporting purposes, which could further increase the amount of rebates paid by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u00b7 extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u00b7 addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and for oral solid line extensions and reformulated drugs, which, depending on how the provision is interpreted and implemented, could increase our Medicaid rebate rate substantially;\n\u00b7 imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products and established an annual non-deductible fee on entities that sell branded prescription drugs or biologics to specified government programs in the United States, beginning in 2011;\n\u00b7 expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), including the creation of new penalties for non-compliance; and\n\u00b7 included a 50% point-of-sale discount off negotiated prices on applicable brand-name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole,\u201d as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nOther legislative and regulatory changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. These automatic reductions included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. Increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements, and delays in feedback from the FDA may affect our ability to update or adjust our label in a timely manner in the interest of patient adherence and tolerability. We cannot predict whether other legislative changes will be adopted or how such changes would affect the pharmaceutical industry generally and the commercialization of PROCYSBI specifically.\nLegislative changes regarding manufacturers\u2019 rebate obligations for new formulations of oral solid dosage form drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, if applied to PROCYSBI, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Affordable Care Act created a new formula to determine the rebate amount owed by manufacturers of \u201cline extension\u201d drugs that would likely lead to higher rebates owed by such manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The Affordable Care Act defined a line extension drug to mean a new formulation of a drug, \u201csuch as an extended release formulation.\u201d In April 2010, CMS stated that it would issue additional guidance to manufacturers and other stakeholders concerning line extensions of existing drugs. In 2012, in implementing the new law, CMS proposed a broad definition of a line extension drug to include any single source or innovator multiple source drug that is an oral solid dosage form approved by the FDA as a change to the initial brand name listed drug; a new formulation of a previously approved oral solid dosage form drug; a new combination of two or more oral solid dosage form drugs; or a new indication for an already marketed oral solid dosage form drug. In the proposed rule, orphan drugs were included as part of the definition of a line extension drug. Although CMS has not yet issued a final rule, CMS expects to finalize the rule in 2015. In the event that CMS finalizes the rule as currently proposed, PROCYSBI would likely be subject to the new rebate calculations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and, as a result, PROCYSBI sales to Medicaid beneficiaries would be reimbursed at cost and any profits from those sales would be eliminated. Approximately 20% of our current PROCYSBI sales are to Medicaid beneficiaries. Accordingly, the implementation of the proposed rules may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject, directly and indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, physician payment transparency laws, corrupt practices and bribery laws and health information privacy and security laws. Failure to comply with these laws may subject us to substantial penalties.\nWe do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors. However, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws and regulations apply to us and our arrangements with healthcare providers, customers and other entities, including our marketing practices, educational programs and pricing policies. These laws include:\n\u00b7 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u00b7 federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7 the federal Civil Monetary Penalties law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u00b7 federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u00b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u00b7 the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners (manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year);\n\u00b7 in the EEA, in various member states including France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain, rules adopted by the legislator or self-regulatory industry bodies requiring the notification and/or publication of certain transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals (for example, France has recently adopted legislation (Law No. 2011-2012, or the \u201cFrench Sunshine Act,\u201d and Decree no. 2013-414 which implements it) requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose and publish agreements with or transfers of value to healthcare professionals);\n\u00b7 the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity; the UK Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors; and bribery provisions contained in the German Criminal Code, which, pursuant to draft legislation being prepared by the German government, may make the corruption and corruptibility of physicians in private practice and other healthcare professionals a criminal offense; and\n\u00b7 analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, as we expand our development and commercialization activities outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships with various third parties, such as independent contractors, distributors, vendors, advocacy groups and physicians, and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities and physicians employed by state-run healthcare institutions who may be deemed to be foreign officials under the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or similar laws of other countries that may govern our activities. Any interactions with any such parties or individuals where compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in significant civil and criminal penalties.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our products, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. We are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, distributors and CROs may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. While we have policies and procedures in place prohibiting such activity, misconduct by these parties could include, among other infractions or violations, intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates FDA regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data or other commercial or regulatory laws or requirements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market PROCYSBI, RP103 and other future drug candidates and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. See also the risk factor titled \u201cIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs in the United States, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nOur reliance on third parties may result in delays in completing, or a failure to complete, preclinical testing, clinical trials or regulatory marketing submissions.\nIn the course of product development, we engage and collaborate with a variety of external organizations to perform services essential to drug product development. The organizations which perform services may include, but are not limited to: governmental agencies and university laboratories; other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; CMOs; CROs; distribution and supply (logistics) service organizations; contract testing organizations; consultants or consulting organizations with specialized knowledge based expertise; and intellectual property law firms.\nAs a result of our engagement of these types of organizations to help us with our product development programs, many important aspects of our business are and will be out of our direct control. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our product development programs complies with applicable regulatory requirements, and our reliance on these organizations does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If any such organizations we engage in the future fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform in a satisfactory manner in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, we may face delays in completing our development and commercialization processes for any of our drug product candidates and could be required to repeat testing or clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Furthermore, any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials, regulatory filings and the potential market approval of our drug product candidates.\nSpecifically, we have and will continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs and/or co-operative groups, to assist us in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials as well as to process the clinical results. Any failure of such third parties to perform or to meet the applicable standards will result in delays in or failures to complete trials. A failure by such third parties to observe the terms of a product development program for any particular product candidate or to complete the clinical trials for a product candidate in the anticipated time frame could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our dependence on collaborative arrangements with third parties subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our ability to develop and commercialize products:\n\u00b7 collaborative arrangements might not be available on terms which are reasonably favorable to us, or at all;\n\u00b7 disagreements with partners may result in delays in the development and marketing of products, termination of collaboration agreements or time consuming and expensive legal action;\n\u00b7 agreement terms may be difficult or costly to enforce;\n\u00b7 partners may not allocate sufficient funds or resources to the development, promotion or marketing of our product candidates, or may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7 partners may choose to develop, independently or with other companies, alternative products or treatments, including products or treatments which compete with ours;\n\u00b7 agreements with partners may expire or be terminated without renewal, or partners may breach agreements with us;\n\u00b7 business combinations or significant changes in a partner\u2019s business strategy or financial resources might adversely affect that partner\u2019s willingness or ability to fulfill its obligations to us; and\n\u00b7 the terms and conditions of the relevant agreements may no longer be suitable.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate acceptable future collaboration agreements or that those currently in existence will make it possible for us to fulfill our objectives.\nWe depend on the support of key scientific and medical collaborators.\nWe must establish and maintain relationships with key opinion leaders, leading scientists and research institutions. We believe that such relationships are critical to establishing products as a standard of care for their approved indications. Although we have various medical and scientific advisors and research collaborations, there is no assurance that our advisors and our research collaborators will continue to work with us or that we will be able to attract additional advisors or collaborators. If we are not able to maintain existing or establish new clinical and scientific relationships to assist in our commercialization and research and development, we may not be able to establish our products as the standard of care or successfully develop our drug product candidates.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent fraud.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A report of our management is included under Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our auditors have provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting in this annual report. During its evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, management identified a material weakness related to our inventory costing and overhead allocations for our commercial product PROCYSBI and determined that our review of our inventory costing and overhead allocations were not performed at a sufficiently detailed level to detect errors in our inventory and related accounts. With the oversight of management and our Audit Committee, we have initiated actions to address the root causes of the material weakness identified in 2014. There can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to remedy the material weakness identified or that additional material weaknesses or other control or significant deficiencies will not be identified in the future. If we continue to experience a material weakness in our internal controls or fail to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, such circumstances could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements, or adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports. Each of the foregoing results could cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in our stock price. See Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for more information.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing (including through human trials), manufacturing and marketing of drugs. PROCYSBI and our drug product candidates could potentially harm people, and we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims regardless of actual harm. Many of the participants in our clinical trials and cystinosis patients who use PROCYSBI are already critically ill or suffering from chronic debilitating diseases. The waivers we obtain from participants in clinical trials may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability or the costs of product liability litigation.\nWe may not be able to avoid significant liability if any product liability claim is brought against us. Although we currently carry product liability insurance, it may not be sufficient to cover any claims. We may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts.\nRegardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to continue clinical trials, costs to defend the related litigation, diversion of management\u2019s time, substantial monetary awards to trial participants, or patients, regulatory investigations, product recalls or withdrawals, labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions and loss of revenue, any of which may materially adversely affect our business, results or operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage our projected growth.\nOur business strategy, including continued commercial sales of PROCYSBI in the United States and certain countries in the EEA, expansion of our commercial operations into other markets, the continuation of our clinical-stage programs and the in-license and acquisition of additional clinical-stage product candidates, will require us to retain existing and add required new qualified and experienced personnel in multiple functional areas over the next several years.\nOur management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to manage the expansion of our operations effectively, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, including additional product candidates.\nIn addition, in connection with the commercial launch of PROCYSBI in the EEA, we have expanded our operations in Europe where we expect to continue to add personnel. We may encounter difficulties successfully managing remotely a substantially larger and internationally diverse organization and may encounter delays in commercialization if we are not successful in integrating our international operations. Challenges related to managing international operations may arise from staffing and managing foreign operations, reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures, diverse individual country regulatory and statutory laws, the costs of maintaining EEA presence, in-country legal entities and related tax structures, fluctuations in currency exchanges and political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions.\nIf our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate revenue could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nCredit risks from customers outside the United States may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSales of our products to government supported customers outside of the United States are likely to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices, which will result in an increase in the length of time that we may have accounts receivable outstanding. In addition, many governments in Europe are facing significant liquidity crises. If government reimbursement for sales of PROCYSBI or any future products in EEA countries is delayed or becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts payable to us in reasonable time frames from such customers, which would cause our capital requirements to increase and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMacroeconomic conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVarious macroeconomic factors, such as changes in inflation, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and overall business and economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from conditions in the global financial markets, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, it may not be feasible to increase the price of PROCYSBI or any future products due to reimbursement procedures and other pricing pressures.\nIn the recent past, the global financial crisis caused financing to be unavailable in many cases or caused the cost of financing to significantly increase. Any similar disruption in the financial markets may increase uncertainty in the debt and equity markets, which may adversely affect our ability to access financing on favorable terms in the future. In addition, our suppliers, manufacturers and other third parties important to our business also may be negatively affected by such potential market dislocations and disruptions, and their businesses may be disrupted, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur product sales in the United States could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices.\nOur recognized product sales in the United States may be reduced if PROCYSBI is imported into the United States from lower-priced markets, whether legally or illegally. In the United States, prices for pharmaceuticals are generally higher than in the bordering nations of Canada and Mexico. There have been proposals to legalize the import of pharmaceuticals from outside the United States. If such legislation were enacted, our revenues could be reduced, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur international sales and operating expenses are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period in which we incur those gains or losses. As a result, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we do business cause foreign currency translation gains and losses. Because of the number of currencies that may be involved as we enter new markets, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates, we may suffer significant foreign currency translation and transaction losses due to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. We have not entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or conversion risks.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could affect our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant challenges in focus and energy to our management.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of intellectual property, products or technologies. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. These transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities; disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products or technologies or to conduct business in new markets; use of existing cash reserves, dilutive issuances of equity securities to replenish cash requirements or to directly pay for transactions, or incurrence of substantial debt to pay for acquisitions; higher-than-expected acquisition and integration costs; increases in near- and long-term expenditures; unexpected difficulties or shortcomings in the development or commercialization of acquired assets, products, or businesses; write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges; increased amortization expenses; difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any future acquired businesses with our operations and personnel; impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although we cannot assure you that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development activities and those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including components of our product and product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, security breaches and other cyber-attacks. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business. Despite the extensive measures we may take to secure data and our information technology systems, a determined hacker or other bad actor may still breach these security measures and our information technology systems. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness disruptions from the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment or that of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers.\nOur executive offices and laboratory facility are located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We and our contract manufacturers and source suppliers of raw materials and critical services are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fires, storms and other extreme weather conditions, floods, water shortages, power losses, telecommunications failures, outbreaks of disease and similar events. If such a disaster were to occur, our ability to continue our operations, including commercial sales and product development programs, could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions, and we may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Competition\nIf we are unable to protect adequately our proprietary technology, we may not be able to compete as effectively, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary technology from unauthorized use by third parties. We will be able to obtain such protection only to the extent our products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets. Any non-confidential disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements and erode our competitive position in the market. Where we elect to pursue patent protection on our proprietary technology, we file, prosecute and maintain patent applications covering certain aspects of our technology. Patent protection may not be available, however, for some of the drug product candidates we are developing. In addition, if we are required to spend significant time and money obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patent rights, designing around patents held by others or obtaining licenses to third-party patents or other proprietary rights that cover aspects of our product candidates, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nThe patent application process, also known as patent prosecution, is expensive and time consuming. It is possible that we or our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. If our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us regarding any aspect of the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patent rights covering our product candidates where they have decision-making rights on such matters, our preferred approach may not be followed and the scope, strength, duration or other aspects of such patent rights could be compromised.\nIn addition, our patents and applications or those of our licensors may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Defects in form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors may adversely affect proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. As a result, the patent rights we depend upon to protect our technology may be held invalid or unenforceable or may be limited in scope. Moreover, we cannot assure you that all of the patent applications that we own or license will issue as patents or that, if issued, the claims of such patents will have a scope that will be advantageous to us.\nThe rights granted to us under the issued patents, as well as those that may be granted on pending patent applications that we own or license, may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. In such case, competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes comparable to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may in the future be subject to claims by our former employees or consultants asserting an ownership right in our patents or patent applications as a result of the work they performed on our behalf. Although we generally require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to assign or grant similar rights to us under their inventions arising while working for us, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all who may have contributed to our inventions and intellectual property, nor can we be certain that our agreements with such parties will not be breached.\nIf any of our patents or those of our licensors are challenged, invalidated or legally circumvented by third parties, and if we do not own other enforceable patents protecting our products, competitors could market products and use processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours, and our business will suffer. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to succeed against competition from third parties and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur patents, even if issued, may not afford us the degree of protection we require to maintain a competitive advantage.\nWe own or license issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications related to certain of our drug product candidates and our other technologies. Evaluating the strength of patents covering our products candidates and other technologies in the biopharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be highly uncertain. While we also rely on orphan drug exclusivity for PROCYSBI for commercial protection, the degree of patent protection we require may be unavailable or severely limited in some cases and may not adequately protect our products or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. For example, the patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other countries. Even if patents do issue on such patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, U.S. patents can be challenged by any person before the new USPTO Patent Trial and Appeals Board at any time within the one-year period following that person\u2019s receipt of an allegation of infringement of the patents. Patents granted by the European Patent Office may be similarly opposed by any person within nine months from the publication of the grant. Similar proceedings are available in other jurisdictions, and in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions, third parties can raise questions of validity with a patent office even before a patent has granted.\nEven if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications, if granted, may not adequately protect our product candidates or technology or prevent others from designing around our patent claims. For example, a third party may develop a competitive product that provides therapeutic benefits similar to one or more of our product candidates but that has a different composition that falls outside the scope of our patent protection. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we own or license covering our product candidates is successfully challenged, then our ability to commercialize such product candidates could be adversely affected, and we may face unexpected competition that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, competitors may interfere with our success in obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates and technologies in a variety of ways. Competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us or our licensors or may file patent applications before we or our licensors do. Competitors may also claim that we are infringing on their patents and that we therefore cannot develop or commercialize our product candidates or practice our technology. Competitors may also challenge our patents, if issued, by showing the patent examiner that the invention claimed was not original, was not novel or was obvious. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our patents, if granted, are not valid for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would lose some or all of our rights to the challenged patents.\nFurthermore, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without adequate and continuing patent protection for our product candidates and technologies, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such products and competitive versions of our technologies.\nIf we do not obtain, or if we lose, adequate patent protection for our product candidates, and if we do not have other regulatory exclusivity for such product candidates as described under the risk factor titled \u201cIf we fail to maintain orphan drug or other regulatory exclusivity for PROCYSBI or to obtain and maintain exclusivity for our orphan drug product candidates, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions, possibly at lower prices, and our revenues will be significantly reduced,\u201d others may develop and commercialize products that are the same as, or similar to, our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may in the future become involved in lawsuits to defend against third-party allegations of infringement or to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe drug product and biopharmaceutical industry has been characterized by frequent and extensive intellectual property litigation. Our competitors or other third-party patent holders may assert that our products are covered by their patents. Although we believe we have adequate defenses available if faced with any allegations that we infringe third-party patents, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe on those patents or that we will not infringe on patents granted in the future. Furthermore, because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, and because pending patent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our products. If a patent holder believes our drug product infringes on its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology. Moreover, we may face patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. If our products are found to infringe, we could be prevented from manufacturing or marketing those products.\nIn addition, competitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To stop any such infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary. If we or one of our licensors or licensees were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements for patent issuance, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Patents may be unenforceable if someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. The outcomes of proceedings involving assertions of invalidity and unenforceability are unpredictable. Furthermore, prior art that would render our patents invalid may exist. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability of our patents covering one of our product candidates or technologies, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidates or technologies. Such a loss of patent protection would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly if we do not have other regulatory protection. Moreover, our competitors could counterclaim in any suit to enforce our patents that we infringe their intellectual property.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights or may allege an ownership right in our patents resulting from their past employment or consultancy with us. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from claiming an ownership interest in or infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Competing products may also be sold in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit alleging our infringement of a competitor\u2019s patents, we could be prevented from marketing our product candidates in one or more foreign countries.\nLitigation related to infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights, with or without merit, is unpredictable, is generally expensive and time consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we do not prevail in any litigation in which we are alleged to have infringed or misappropriated intellectual property rights, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees and could prohibit us from using technologies essential to our product candidates, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If patents asserted against us are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe them, we could be prevented from selling our product candidates or technologies unless we can obtain licenses to use the technology or ideas covered by such patents. We do not know whether any necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we cannot obtain such licenses, we could be forced to design around the infringed patents at additional cost or to abandon the infringing product candidate or technology altogether. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. As a result, our ability to grow our business and compete in the market may be harmed.\nWe may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational institutions. These research partners may be unwilling to grant us any exclusive rights to technology or product candidates derived from these collaborations. If we do not obtain required licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or even be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling drug product candidates requiring these licenses. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or drug product candidates developed in collaboration with other parties. Any such disputes may cause our competitive position to be adversely affected and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates or technologies, we may not be able to prevent a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly if we do not have other regulatory protection for our products.\nWe may not be able to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates and technologies in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws. In addition, laws of some countries outside of the United States do not afford intellectual property protection to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. In addition, competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, if our ability to enforce our patents to stop infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. See also the risk factor titled \u201cOur success depends on our ability to manage our projected growth.\u201d\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and resources from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in major markets for our products, there can be no assurance that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our products. In addition, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nChanges to the patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on our having valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Recent patent reform legislation in the United States and other countries, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or Leahy-Smith Act, signed into law on September 16, 2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act has transformed the U.S. patent system into a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system. The first-to-file provisions, however, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could make it more difficult to obtain patent protection for our inventions and increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition, there have been recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could affect our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology or our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nIf we are limited in our ability to utilize acquired or licensed technologies, or if we lose our rights to critical in-licensed technology, we may be unable to successfully develop, out-license, market and sell our products, which could prevent or delay new product introductions.\nWe have acquired and licensed certain proprietary technologies and plan to further license and acquire various patents and proprietary technologies owned by other parties. The agreements in place are critical to our product development programs. For example, most of our patent portfolio pertaining to PROCYSBI and RP103 for cystinosis and other therapeutic indications has been licensed from academic institutions. Our license agreements with these institutions include termination clauses that permit the licensor to terminate our license under certain circumstances, including if we materially breach our obligations under the applicable agreement. If one or more of our licenses is terminated, we would have no further right to use or exploit the patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights licensed to us under the agreement, which could adversely affect our ability to market PROCYSBI or continue our development programs of RP103 in other clinical indications.\nOur business strategy depends on the successful development of licensed and acquired technologies into commercial products. Therefore, any limitations on our ability to utilize these technologies may impair our ability to develop, out-license or market and sell our product candidates, could delay new product introductions and could adversely affect our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our competitive position may be harmed, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. Our trade secrets may not be adequately protected, however. We have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and corporate and educational institution partners. Nevertheless, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, whether willful or unintentional, or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that someone illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement or that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of a former employer or competitor in breach of their obligations to that employer or competitor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defenses to these claims fail, in addition to requiring us to pay monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate such technologies or features would have a material adverse effect on our business, and may prevent us from successfully commercializing our products. In addition, we may lose the right to practice valuable intellectual property rights or personnel as a result of such claims. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products. Any of these events, or a combination thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nOur commercial operations and clinical development programs will require substantial future funding which will affect our operational and financial condition.\nOur commercial sales programs for PROCYSBI and any future approved products and our product development programs will require substantial additional capital, arising from costs incurred to:\n\u00b7 conduct research, preclinical testing and human studies and clinical trials; develop and submit regulatory submissions for marketing approvals;\n\u00b7 develop and submit regulatory submissions for marketing approvals;\n\u00b7 establish or contract for pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities;\n\u00b7 obtain adequate reimbursement for our products;\n\u00b7 market and distribute PROCYSBI and any future approved products; and\n\u00b7 establish, develop and maintain quality control, manufacturing, regulatory, medical, distribution, marketing, sales, finance and administrative capabilities to support these programs.\nWe base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables. Such uncertainties include the success of our commercial sales of PROCYSBI in the United States, the EEA and any additional markets; the success of our efforts to commercialize any future approved products; the scope and results of our research initiatives, preclinical testing and human clinical trials; regulatory approvals; the timing of events outside our direct control, such as competing technological and market developments, negotiations with third-party payors and potential strategic partners; and other factors. In addition, certain product programs may require collaborative agreements with corporate partners with greater financial and organizational resources than we have. Such agreements may require substantial time to complete and may not be available in the time frame desired or with acceptable financial terms, if at all. Any of these factors may significantly change the timing and amount of our cash requirements as they determine such one-time events as the receipt or payment of milestone-based and other payments.\nIf we fail to raise additional financing when needed, we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development programs, scale back our operations and/or reduce our commercial finance and administrative expenses to sustainable levels, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operating and financial condition.\nWhile we believe that, based upon our projected PROCYSBI sales and planned operations, our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2014 of approximately $150 million will be sufficient to meet our projected operational requirements and obligations through 2016, we will need to sell equity or debt securities to raise additional funds to support, among other things, our development and commercialization programs. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities will result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and newly issued securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Additional financing may not be available on a timely basis, in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. We may be unable to raise additional capital due to a variety of factors, including our financial condition, the status of our research and development programs, the status of regulatory reviews for marketing approvals, the status of our commercialization activities, sales of PROCYSBI in existing and additional markets and the general condition of the financial markets. If we fail to raise additional financing when needed, we may have to delay, partner, or terminate some or all of our research and development programs, scale back our operations and/or reduce our commercial expenses. If such actions are required, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected, and the market value of our common stock may significantly decline.\nOur loan agreement with HC Royalty and outstanding convertible senior notes contain a number of restrictive covenants and other provisions, which, if violated, could result in the acceleration of the payment terms of our outstanding indebtedness, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn December 2012, we entered into a loan agreement with HealthCare Royalty Partners II, L.P., or HC Royalty, as lender, which we refer to as the HC Royalty Loan Agreement. Under the HC Royalty Loan Agreement, we agreed to borrow $50.0 million in two $25.0 million tranches. We drew down the first tranche in the amount of $25.0 million in December 2012 and the second tranche of $25.0 million in May 2013 when we achieved the milestone of U.S. approval of PROCYSBI. In July 2014, we entered into an amendment and restatement of the original HC Royalty Loan Agreement and borrowed from HC Royalty a third, $10.0 million tranche under the loan facility. Also in July 2014, we issued $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% convertible senior notes due 2019 to HC Royalty and other purchasers.\nThe HC Royalty Loan Agreement includes a number of affirmative and negative covenants, including requirements to use commercially reasonable efforts to exploit PROCYSBI and RP103 in specific markets and to comply with applicable laws, and additional restrictions on mergers, sales of assets, the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and transactions with our affiliates, among other requirements. The convertible senior notes also include a number of affirmative and negative covenants, including our obligation to offer to repurchase the notes upon a change of control of our company, limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, registration rights for the holders of the notes and other requirements.\nThe performance of our obligations under the HC Royalty Loan Agreement is secured by our grant of a security interest to HC Royalty in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of stock of certain of our domestic subsidiaries. Our failure to comply with the terms of the HC Royalty Loan Agreement, the convertible senior notes and related documents could result in an event of default. A change of control of our company, an uncured material adverse effect on our company and certain other specified events could also constitute an event of default under the agreements. In the event of an event of default that is not cured or waived, the payment of all of our indebtedness to HC Royalty and interest thereon and the repayment of the convertible senior notes could accelerate. Under the terms of the security agreement, an event of default could also enable the lender to take possession of, foreclose on, sell, assign or grant a license to use our pledged collateral and to assign and transfer the pledged stock of certain of our subsidiaries. An event of default, a material adverse effect or a change of control would also trigger a prepayment penalty under the HC Royalty Loan Agreement, which would require us to pay a substantially higher amount due than the current balance of our loan.\nAny of the events described above, or a combination thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nThe required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness under the HC Royalty Loan Agreement and convertible senior notes may require a substantial portion, or all, of our available cash to be dedicated to the service of these debt obligations. Both the HC Royalty Loan Agreement and the convertible senior notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 8.0%. The HC Royalty Loan Agreement also bears a synthetic royalty based on our net revenues from PROCYSBI and other future-approved products in a calendar year. This royalty and the interest under the HC Royalty Loan Agreement and the convertible senior notes are payable quarterly. Principal payments under the HC Royalty Loan Agreement will become due beginning in June 2015. The convertible senior notes will mature on August 1, 2019, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.\nThere can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that we will have capital resources in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness to HC Royalty or the holders of the convertible senior notes. Our debt obligations may also limit our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with superior financial resources including less debt. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund these debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay product development, sales and marketing and capital and other expenditures. We may also be forced to restructure our indebtedness or raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt instruments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or raise additional capital on a timely basis, in sufficient amounts, on satisfactory terms or at all. The terms of the HC Royalty Loan Agreement and convertible senior notes may also limit our ability to pursue any of these financing alternatives, and these alternatives nonetheless may not enable us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nFailure to meet our debt service obligations may result in an event of default under the HC Royalty Loan Agreement, which would permit the lender to accelerate the payment of all of our indebtedness to HC Royalty and interest thereon. An event of default could also enable the lender to take possession of, foreclose on, sell, assign or grant a license to use our pledged collateral and to assign and transfer the pledged stock of certain of our subsidiaries. An event of default, a material adverse effect or a change of control would also trigger a prepayment penalty under the HC Royalty Loan Agreement, which would require us to pay a substantially higher amount than the current balance of our loan.\nFailure to meet our debt service obligations may also result in an event of default under the convertible senior notes, which would permit the holders to accelerate the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the notes and interest thereon and require us to pay a repayment premium and higher interest. A change of control would also trigger an obligation to repurchase the convertible senior notes.\nAny of the events described above, or a combination thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited by Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change. Furthermore, we may be unable to use a substantial part of our net operating loss carryforwards if we do not attain profitability in an amount sufficient to utilize such losses.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the prices that they paid. The trading volume in our common stock may be relatively small.\nOur common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. During the 52-week period ended February 20, 2015, our average daily trading volume was approximately 813,664 shares and the closing sales price per share of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market ranged from $7.51 to $17.41. Our operating performance, both financial and in the development of approved products, significantly affects the market price of our common stock. A number of factors may affect the market price of our common stock, including:\n\u00b7 the success of our testing and clinical trials and those of others with products similar or related to our products;\n\u00b7 announcements regarding regulatory approvals or approved label indications and patient populations or changes or delays in the regulatory review process;\n\u00b7 unexpected difficulties in commercialization or lower than expected sales;\n\u00b7 lower than expected pricing and reimbursement levels, or no reimbursement at all, for our products in various markets;\n\u00b7 actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u00b7 changes in our relationships with manufacturers, suppliers or collaborators, or our inability to supply enough product to meet demand;\n\u00b7 announcements of new products or innovations by us or our competitors and announcements concerning our competitors or our industry in general;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain additional funding;\n\u00b7 changes or developments in applicable laws or regulations;\n\u00b7 any intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become involved;\n\u00b7 sales and profitability;\n\u00b7 announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us, our strategic collaboration partners or our competitors;\n\u00b7 our ability to manage our projected growth;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or their ceasing to publish research or reports about our business;\n\u00b7 the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7 general economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets;\n\u00b7 the appeal and current level of investor interest in the biotechnology/biopharmaceutical capital market sector and in companies in general with business, research strategies and product development pipelines which are similar to us; and\n\u00b7 the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, market launch and commercialization goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones include the completion of reimbursement and pricing negotiations and commercial launches in additional territories, commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. We also prepare estimates of future financial results for planning and budget purposes. From time to time, we may publicly announce the estimated timing of some of these milestones and provide guidance regarding financial results and other metrics. All of these projections will be based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones and actual financial results can vary dramatically compared to our estimates for a number of reasons, including those set forth above, in many cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet the milestones, financial guidance or other expectations as publicly announced or as projected by various security analysts who follow our company, our stockholders or potential stockholders may lose confidence in our ability to meet overall objectives and our financial planning capabilities, and as a result, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIn addition, the NASDAQ Global Market has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies in a comparable stage to ours historically have been particularly volatile, and trading volume in such securities and our common stock has often been relatively small. Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. During certain periods, the favor of certain industry segments, such as the biotechnology segment, may also be volatile. These changes may affect in particular the market price of our common stock and the stock prices of companies such as ours that do not have conventional measures of financial and business health such as sales, earnings, profitability and related measures. These broad market fluctuations, during which our industry and companies at our stage may experience a stronger degree of market sensitivity, will adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market resulting in substantial declines in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation can result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our and reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture sales or issuances of our common stock or other securities in the public market, including shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible senior notes, or the perception of such future sales or issuances, could lead to a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nAny issuance of shares of our common stock or other securities, including for the purposes of raising capital to fund our operations, acquisitions and the expansion of our business, will have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. In addition, any issuance or the perceived market risk associated with any possible issuance could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Subsequent sales of our common stock in the open market, exercises of our currently outstanding stock options, conversion of our convertible senior notes and the subsequent sale of the shares acquired thereunder or any other issuance by us of shares of our common stock or other securities could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. If the market price of our common stock declines, it will be more difficult for us to raise additional capital, or we may be unable to raise additional capital at all.\nIn addition, we have in the past and may in the future grant rights to some of our stockholders that require us to register the resale of shares or our common stock on behalf of these stockholders and/or to facilitate offerings of shares of our common stock held by these stockholders, including in connection with potential future acquisitions of additional products, product candidates or companies. If holders of such registration rights sell a large number of shares of our common stock, the sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We have also filed registration statements to register the sale of our shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase plan and intend to file additional registration statements to register any shares added to the reserves under these plans.\nIn July 2014, we issued $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% convertible senior notes due 2019. The convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of the holder at an initial conversion rate of approximately 57.14 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $17.50, and is subject to adjustment upon certain events and conditions. In addition, we may redeem for cash or require holders to convert the convertible senior notes into shares of common stock if the price of the common stock is at or above 175% of the applicable conversion price over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. The note purchase agreement governing the convertible senior notes provides the holders with registration rights for the shares issued upon conversion of their convertible senior notes subject to certain conditions, and we have filed a registration statement to register the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible senior notes. We may be required to pay increased interest on the convertible senior notes if we do not comply with the registration rights provisions of the note purchase agreement. A substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon conversion of the convertible senior notes. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the convertible senior notes would dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders and may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nIn connection with other collaborations, joint ventures, license agreements or future financings that we may enter into in the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities, and the value of the securities issued may be substantial and create additional dilution to our common stockholders.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, investors will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value. Investors seeking dividend income should not purchase shares of our common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception. We anticipate that we will retain our earnings to support our operations and to finance the growth and development of our business and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our loan agreement with HC Royalty prohibits us from paying cash dividends. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in the market price of our common stock. There can be no guarantee that the market price our common stock will appreciate or that it will not depreciate. Investors seeking dividend income should not invest in our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, in our stockholder rights plan and in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, may prevent or complicate attempts by stockholders to change the board of directors or current management and could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, contain provisions that could significantly reduce the value of our shares to a potential acquirer or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. The provisions in our charter documents include the following:\n\u00b7 the right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7 the required approval of at least 66 2\u20443% of the shares entitled to vote to remove a director without cause;\n\u00b7 the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences, dividend rights and voting rights, which may be superior to those of the common stock, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u00b7 the ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u00b7 the required approval of at least 66 2\u20443% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\u00b7 a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u00b7 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nWe are also party to a stockholder rights plan, also referred to as a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d which is intended to deter a hostile takeover of us by making such proposed acquisition more expensive for and less desirable to the potential acquirer.\nOur board of directors may use the provisions described above to prevent changes in the management and control of our company. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions would apply even if we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nProvisions of the note purchase agreement governing our convertible senior notes may discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe repurchase rights and related repurchase premium provided in our convertible senior notes triggered by the occurrence of a change of control may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. In turn, this could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 88148, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "RPTP"}
