{"cik": "1120914", "company": "PDF SOLUTIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe invest significant resources into research and development to pursue new product and technology initiatives, including our DFI system and Exensio platform, and if we invest more resources in research and development than anticipated or fail to successfully carry out these initiatives on the expected timeline or at all, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nAs part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments in research and development efforts to develop new products, including our DFI system and Exensio software platform, as well continued investment to enhance existing products. New competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. The technologies or products that we invest in may later not be sought after by semiconductor companies. In this event, we would not recoup our investment and our results would suffer. If we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur sales cycle is lengthy and customers may delay entering into contracts or decide not to adopt our products or solutions after we have performed services or provided evaluation licenses, which could result in delays in recognizing revenue and negatively impact our results of operations in a quarter or result in lower revenue than we expected if a contract is not consummated at all.\nOn-going negotiations and evaluation projects for new products, with new customers or in new markets may not result in significant revenues for us if we are unable to close new engagements on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner, or at all. Unexpected delays in our sales cycle could cause our revenues to fall short of expectations. Further, the timing and length of negotiations required to enter into agreements with our customers and the ultimate enforcement of complex negotiated contractual provisions as we intended is difficult to predict. If we do not successfully negotiate certain key complex contractual provisions, there are disputes regarding such provisions, or they are not enforceable as we intended, our revenues and results of operations would suffer. Further, our customers sometimes delay starting negotiations until they begin developing a new process, need to insert a new product, or experience specific yield issues. This means that on occasion we have, and may continue to provide technology and services under preliminary documentation before executing the final contract. In these cases, we would not recognize revenue and may defer associated costs until execution of the final contract, which, if significant, could negatively impact our results of operations in the periods before we execute the final contract. Further, if we were to incur significant effort and then fail to enter into a final contract, we would have to write-off such deferred costs in the period in which the negotiations ended, which would decrease our costs and expenses and could result in significant operating losses.\nOur fixed-fee services or product or system installation/configurations may take longer than budgeted, which could slow our revenue recognition and may also result in a loss contract or a claim of breach by our customers, which would negatively affect our operating results.\nOur fixed-fee services, including in particular IYR, require a team of engineers to collaborate with our customers to address complex issues by using our software and other technologies, and the installation and configuration of our software into our customers\u2019 fabrication and test/assembly facilities requires experienced engineers working with our customers on active foundry and test/assembly equipment.\nWe must estimate the amount of resources needed to complete both of these types of services in order to estimate when the engineers will be able to commence the next engagement. In addition, our accounting for contracts with such services, which generate fixed fees, sometimes requires adjustments to profit (loss) based on revised estimates during the performance of the contract. These adjustments may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which they are made. The estimates giving rise to these risks, which are inherent in fixed-price contracts, include the forecasting of costs and schedules, and contract revenues related to contract performance. If we significantly fail to meet a customer\u2019s expectations in either case, the customer could claim that we breached our obligations, which could result in lost revenue and increased expenses.\nOur ability to sell our products, systems, and solutions depends in part on the quality of our support and services offerings, and the failure to offer high-quality support and services could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.\nOnce our software products are integrated within our customers\u2019 hardware and software systems, our customers may depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our products. Further, in connection with delivering our software as a service, which requires us to maintain adequate server hardware and internet infrastructure, including system redundancies, we will need to meet contractual uptime obligations. A high level of system and support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products. If we do not effectively provide subscription access to our SaaS customers, assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and provide effective ongoing support and data security, we may face contractual penalties or customers may not renew subscriptions or services in the future, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, due to our international operations, our system and support organization faces challenges associated with delivering support, hours that support is available, training, and documentation where the user\u2019s native language may not be English. If we fail to maintain high-quality support and services and adequately address our customers\u2019 support needs, our customers may choose our competitors\u2019 products instead of ours in the future, which would negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nDefects in our proprietary technologies, hardware and software tools, and failure to effectively remedy any such defects could decrease our revenue and our competitive market share.\nIf the software, hardware, or proprietary technologies we provide to customers contain defects that negatively impact customers' ability to use our systems or software, increase our customers\u2019 cost of goods sold and time-to-market or damage our customers\u2019 property, these defects could significantly decrease the market acceptance of our solutions or results in warranty or other claims. We must adequately train our new personnel, especially our client service and technical support personnel, to effectively and accurately, respond to and support our customers. If we fail to do this, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our customers, which could slow our growth. Further, the cost of support resources required to remedy any defects in our technologies, hardware, or software tools could exceed our expectations. Any actual or perceived defects with our software, hardware, or proprietary technologies may also hinder our ability to attract or retain industry partners or customers, leading to a decrease in our revenue. These defects are frequently found during the period following introduction of new software, hardware, or proprietary technologies or enhancements to existing software, hardware, or proprietary technologies. Our software, hardware, and proprietary technologies may contain errors not discovered until after customer implementation of the silicon design and manufacturing process recommended by us. If our software, hardware, or proprietary technologies contain errors or defects, it could require us to expend significant resources to remedy these problems or defend/indemnify claims, which could reduce margins and result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other customer implementations and development efforts.\nInadvertent disclosure of our customers\u2019 confidential information or our failure to comply with our customers\u2019 security rules, including for cloud-based solutions or on-site access could result in costly litigation, cause us to lose existing and potential customers, or negatively impact on-going business with existing customers.\nOur customers consider their product yield information and other confidential information, which we must collect in the course of our engagement with the customer or through our software tools, to be extremely competitively sensitive, including data and personal data about our customers\u2019 employees necessary to administer the licenses. Many of our customers have strict security rules for on-site access to, or hosting, to their confidential information. If we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or we inadvertently disclosed or were required to disclose this information, or if we fail to adequately comply with customers\u2019 security protocols for accessing or hosting confidential information, we would likely lose existing and potential customers, could be subject to costly litigation, or our on-going business could be negatively impacted. Insurance to cover such situations is costly and will increase our costs and may not fully cover our exposure. In addition, to avoid potential disclosure of confidential information to competitors, some of our customers may, in the future, ask us not to work with key products or processes, which could limit our revenue opportunities.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and a large percentage of our revenues from a single customer, so decreased business with, our the loss of, any one of these customers, or pricing pressure, or customer consolidation could significantly reduce our revenues or margins and negatively impact results of operations.\nHistorically, we have had a small number of large customers for our IYR solutions and that contribute significant Gainshare royalties. In the year ended December 31, 2019, one customer, GlobalFoundries, accounted for 31% of our revenues. We could lose a customer due to its decision not to engage us on future process nodes, its negotiation or decision to reduce the scope of our services or technology under contract (which is permitted in one of our customer contracts if the customer\u2019s business materially adversely changes), its decision not to develop its own future process node, or as a result of industry factors, including but not limited to reduced manufacturing volume or consolidation. During 2018, a major customer announced that it was suspending indefinitely the development and production of its 7nm technology node. This customer\u2019s decision has negatively impacted our Integrated Yield Ramp revenues, and future Integrated Yield Ramp revenues will be negatively affected in the long-term as such revenues would have included the Gainshare from this contract but now will not since Gainshare is based on the customer\u2019s future production, which will not occur. Consolidation among our customers could also lead to increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. Further, new business may be delayed if a key customer uses its leverage to push for terms that are worse for us and we delay entering into the contract to negotiate for better terms, in which case revenue in any particular quarter or year may fail to meet expectations. Also, the loss of any of these customers or the failure to secure new contracts with these customers could further increase our reliance on our remaining customers. Further, if any of our key customers default, declare bankruptcy or otherwise delay or fail to pay amounts owed, or we otherwise have a dispute with any of these customers, our results of operations would be negatively affected in the short term and possibly the long term. These events could cause significant fluctuations in results of operations because our expenses are fixed in the short term and it takes us a long time to replace customers or reassign resources.\nIf we do not continuously meet our development milestones of key research and development projects or if we cannot qualify our e-beam measurement tool at customers for inline wafer inspection on schedule or at all, or successfully commercialize our Design-for-Inspection system, our future market opportunity and revenues will suffer and our costs may not be recouped.\nCertain use cases of our DFI system remain to be proven and the inline version is pending qualification by the first commercial customer. To date, we have invested significantly in the design and development of our eProbe tool and related intellectual property. If our key customer fails to renew or expand the number or use of the systems it is using, or new foundry customers fail to adopt our DFI system, our results will suffer. For example, in 2018 an early adopter of our DFI system at 7nm elected to exercise an early exit under the contract in connection with its decision to suspend indefinitely further development and production at 7nm, which negatively impacted the long-term revenue we expected under this contract and possibility for renewal or expansion. Also, if the results of our DFI system are not as we expect, we may not be able to successfully commercialize these technologies on schedule, or at all, and we may miss the market opportunity and not recoup our investment. Further, our eProbe tool may cause unexpected damage to wafers or delay processing wafers, which we could be liable for, or which may make customers unwilling to use it. If we are not able to create significant interest and show reliable and useful results without significant damage to wafers, our investment may not be recouped and our future results may suffer.\nDecreases in wafer volumes at our customers\u2019 manufacturing sites or the volume of ICs that some of our customers are able to sell to their customers would cause our Gainshare royalty and, thus, Integrated Yield Ramp revenue to suffer.\nOur Gainshare royalty is largely determined by wafer volumes at manufacturing sites covered by our contracts and, in some cases, the volume of an IC product that our customer is able to sell to its customers. Both of these factors are outside of our control. Further, some of our manufacturing customers\u2019 business is largely dependent on customers that use our manufacturing customer as a second or third source. If those customers consolidate and/or otherwise move the orders to manufacturing facilities not covered by our contracts, or suspend their manufacturing at covered facilities for any reason, including consolidation, our Gainshare royalty will decrease, which could cause Integrated Yield Ramp revenues to fail to meet expectations. Reduced demand for semiconductor products decreases the volume of wafers and, in some cases, products our customers are able to sell, which would also directly decrease our Gainshare royalty. For example, 28nm volumes were lower in 2019 than expected, which negatively impacted our results. Also, our customers may unilaterally decide to implement changes to their manufacturing processes during the period that is covered by Gainshare, which could negatively affect yield results and, thus, our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue.\nSince we currently work on a small number of large projects at specified manufacturing sites and, in some cases, on specific IC products, our results of operations are adversely affected by negative changes at those sites or in those products, including slowdowns in manufacturing due to external factors such as the spread of the coronavirus in China. Also, if wafer orders from sites covered by our contracts are not secured by our customers, if an end product does not achieve commercial viability, if a process line or, in some cases, a specific product, does not achieve significant increases in yield or sustain significant volume manufacturing during the time we receive Gainshare, revenues associated with such volumes or products would be negatively impacted. This could significantly reduce our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue and results of operations could fail to meet expectations. In addition, if we work with two directly competitive manufacturing facilities or products, volume in one may offset volume, and thus any of our related Gainshare, in the other facility or product.\nWe face operational and financial risks associated with international operations that could negatively impact our revenues.\nWe derive over half of our revenues from sales outside of the United States and we expect our international business to continue to grow, in particular in China. We have in the past expanded and reorganized, at different times, our operations, including international operations, and may in the future continue such expansion or reorganization by establishing or restructuring international subsidiaries, offices, or contractor relationships in locations, if and when, deemed appropriate by our management. Thus, the success of our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including in particular:\n\u2022\nour growth in China is dependent upon continued investments in the semiconductor industry by both private and public entities within China. Should circumstances change such that the level of investments are substantially reduced, our future growth potential may be limited;\n\u2022\nsome of our key engineers and other personnel are foreign nationals and they may not be permitted access to certain technical information under U.S. export laws or by certain of our customers and may have difficulty gaining access to the United States and other countries in which our customers or our offices may be located and it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees in foreign offices;\n\u2022\nineffective or inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting account receivables resulting in longer collection periods, bad debt, and increased cost to collect;\n\u2022\nlanguage and other cultural differences may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations and negatively impacting sales and revenue;\n\u2022\ncompliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, personal data, tax, protection of our IP, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law;\n\u2022\ncurrency risk due to the fact that certain of our payables and for our international offices are denominated in the foreign currency, including the Euro, Yen, and RMB, while virtually all of our revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars, or in the event a larger portion of our revenues becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk;\n\u2022\ninadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions;\n\u2022\nadditional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries;\n\u2022\nquarantine, private travel limitation, or business disruption in regions affecting our operations, stemming from actual, imminent or perceived outbreak of human pandemic or contagious disease, including the coronavirus; or\n\u2022 economic or political instability, including but not limited to armed conflict, terrorism, interference with information or communication of networks or systems, and the resulting disruption to economic activity and business operations.\nFurther, our employees and contractors include professionals located in various international locations, including Shanghai, China, who provide primarily CV test chip-related services, and Ramallah, Palestine, who provide software-related development, quality assurance, maintenance, and other technical support services for certain of our software products. Political changes, including policies regarding export control, that affect these or other international operations could disrupt or limit the work our employees and contractors are able to perform, and thus negatively affect the range of services we are able to provide our customers or our cost for such services.\nThe spread of COVID-19 coronavirus from China has affected the manufacturing and shipment of goods. In January 2020, the Chinese government imposed certain restrictions on the movement of people and goods to limit the spread of the coronavirus in and around Wuhan. While our China operations are not located in Wuhan, our Shanghai office was temporarily shut down, and the restrictions have limited the ability of our local employees to travel to customer sites or visit our other offices. An extended closure of our customers' plants as a result of efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 in China could adversely impact our business\nIn addition, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. These laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. We may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. If we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, or that employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. A significant violation could have a significantly negatively impact our sales opportunities, operations, and financial results.\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions, which actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results.\nOur ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. For example, while we have increased investment in our business by, for example, increasing headcount, acquiring companies, and increasing our investment in R&D, sales and marketing, and other parts of our business from time to time, including 2018, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce expenses and align our operations with evolving business needs. Some of our expenses related to such efforts are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees. Rapid changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including sales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGlobal economic conditions or semiconductor market conditions could materially adversely impact demand for our products and services, decrease our sales, or delay our sales cycle.\nOur customers are global semiconductor companies, which means that our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions as well as semiconductor market specific changes. Uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in customers postponing purchases of our products and services, including in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values and other macroeconomic factors, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products and services and, accordingly, on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, the timing of the build-out of the semiconductor market in China depends significantly on governmental funding on both local and national levels and a delay in this funding could negatively affect our revenues. For further example, any economic and political uncertainty caused by the United States tariffs imposed on goods from China, among other potential countries, and any corresponding tariffs from China or such other countries in response, may negatively impact demand and/or increase the cost for our products. Similarly, the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus in China or in other nations could cause a slowdown in the global\neconomy and demand for our products and services. Further, the semiconductor industry historically has been volatile with up cycles and down cycles, due to sudden changes in customers\u2019 manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers\u2019 IC products by consumers, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. As a result of the various factors that affect this volatility, the timing and length of any cycles can be difficult to predict and could be longer than anticipated. Any of these events could negatively affect our revenues and make it challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions, and identify the risks that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may also lead to additional bad debt expense.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, customers or potential competitors may be able to use our technologies to develop their own solutions, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenues, or increase our costs.\nOur success depends largely on the proprietary nature of our technologies. Our contractual, patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be effective against any particular threat or in any particular location. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and even if issued, they may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. Our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. Litigation may be necessary from time to time to enforce our IP rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Litigation could also divert our resources, including our managerial and engineering resources. If we are unable to exclude others from using our proprietary technologies and methods without compensation to us, through litigation or otherwise, it could impede our ability to grow our business and our revenues may suffer.\nIf we do not effectively manage, support, and safeguard our worldwide information systems, and integrate recent and planned growth, our business strategy may fail.\nWe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure, as well as the public cloud to an increasing degree, to provide our products and services to our customers. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, interruptions in our information systems on which our global operations depend or unplanned downtime of the infrastructure that delivers our SaaS products. Further, we may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems whether hosted by us or service providers, to intentionally hack, interfere with, or cause physical or digital damage to or failure of such systems (such as significant viruses or worms), which attempts we or they may be unable to prevent. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors, malfeasance, or otherwise. For example, in the first quarter of 2020, one of our cloud installations suffered an intrusion due to a vulnerability discovered and published by the provider of the Citrix ADC that was part of our installation. Third parties may also attempt to influence employees, users, suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our, our customers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 data. Additionally, third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk.\nWe or our service providers could be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects until after it is too late to prevent it and the damage it may cause. The theft, unauthorized use, or a cybersecurity attack that results in the publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could negatively affect our competitive position, the value of our investment in product or research and development, and third parties might assert against us or our customers claims related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information or end-user data and/or system reliability. In any such event, our business could be subject to significant disruption, which could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us, and we could suffer monetary and other losses, including reputational harm, which costs we may not be able to recover from our service providers. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations.\nIn addition, we collect, use, store or disclose (collectively, \u201cprocess\u201d) an increasingly large amount of personal information, including from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Additionally, changes to applicable privacy or\ndata security laws could impact how we process personal information, and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop or deliver new products or services. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became fully effective on May 25, 2018, imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues. Regulation is also increasingly occurring at the U.S. state level to supplement federal legislative action or inaction, as indicated by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which becomes enforceable in 2020 and may apply to our products, services, and data.\nAdditionally, we must frequently expand our internal information system to meet increasing demand in storage, computing and communication, which may result in increased costs. Our internal information system is expensive to expand and must be highly secure due to the sensitive nature of our customers\u2019 information that we transmit. Building and managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on our management and resources. These demands may divert these resources from the continued growth of our business and implementation of our business strategy.\nIf we are not able to retain, attract, motivate, and strategically locate talented employees, including some key executives, our business may suffer.\nOur success and competitiveness depend on our ability to retain, attract, motivate, and strategically locate in our offices around the globe, talented employees, including some of our key executives. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, changes in our management or leadership, the hiring practices at our competitors or customers, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs, including equity-based programs. Further, we have had, and expect to continue to have, difficulty in obtaining visas permitting entry for some of our employees that are foreign nationals into the United States, and delays in obtaining visas permitting entry into other key countries, for several of our key personnel, which disrupts our ability to strategically locate our personnel. In recent years, the United State has increased the level of scrutiny in granting H-1(b), L-1 and other business visas. The Trump administration has indicated that immigration reform is a priority. Compliance with United States immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals. If we lose the services of certain of our key executives or a significant number of our engineers, it could disrupt our ability to implement our business strategy. If we do not successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, including key executives, we may be unable to realize our business objectives and our operating results may suffer.\nOur earnings per share and other operating results may vary quarter to quarter, which could result in not meeting investors\u2019 expectations and cause our stock price to drop.\nOur stock price has fluctuated widely during the last few years, from a low closing price of $7.73 per share in October 2018 to a high closing price of $24.16 per share in December 2016. A factor in the volatility may be that our historical quarterly operating results have fluctuated. Our future quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future period, which could cause our stock price to decrease again. A significant reduction in our stock price negatively impacts our ability to raise equity capital in the public markets and increases the cost to us, as measured by dilution to our existing shareholders, of equity financing. In addition, the reduced stock price also increases the cost to us, in terms of dilution, of using our equity for employee compensation or for acquisitions of other businesses. A greatly reduced stock price could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest, a hostile take-over bid, and fewer business development opportunities. Also, significant volatility in the stock price could be followed by a securities class action lawsuit, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nCompetition in the market for data analytics and related systems and services may intensify in the future, which could impede our ability to grow or execute our strategy.\nCompetition in our market may intensify in the future, which could slow our ability to grow or execute our strategy and could lead to increased pricing pressure, negatively impacting our revenues. Our current and potential customers may choose to develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we are slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet market needs. These and other competitors may be able to operate with a lower cost structure than our engineering organization, which would give any such competitor\u2019s products a competitive advantage over our solutions. We currently face indirect competition from the internal groups at IC companies and some direct competition from providers of (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA-Tencor, Siemens AG (\u201cSiemens\u201d), Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (\u201cRudolph\u201d), Synopsys, Inc., and Qualtera, (ii) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied Materials, Inc., BISTel Inc., Invantest, Inc., Optimal+, Rudolph, and Siemens and, (iii) inline inspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as Applied Materials and Keysight Technologies, Inc.\nFurther, we may compete with the products or offerings of these named companies or additional companies if we expand our offerings through acquisition or development. There may be other providers of commercial solutions for systematic IC yield and performance enhancement of which we are not aware. Further, some providers of yield management software or inspection equipment may seek to broaden their product offerings and compete with us. In addition, we believe that the demand for solutions that address the need for better integration between the silicon design and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competitors to enter into our market. For example, large integrated organizations, such as IDMs, electronic design automation software providers, IC design service companies or semiconductor equipment vendors, may expand their product offerings or decide to spin-off a business unit to compete with us. Other potential competitors include fabrication facilities that may decide to offer solutions competitive with ours as part of their value proposition to their customers. If these potential competitors change the pricing environment or are able to attract industry partners or customers faster than we can, we may not be able to grow and execute our strategy as quickly or at all.\nMeasurement of our Gainshare royalties and other variable consideration requires data collection and customers\u2019 use of estimates in some cases and is subject to customers' agreement and is later offset if actual data differ from customers\u2019 estimates, which can result in uncertainty and cause quarterly results to fluctuate.\nWe can only recognize Gainshare royalty once we have reached agreement with our customers on their level of yield performance improvements and quarterly agreements are sometimes based on estimates of volume results each quarter. Measuring the amount of yield improvement is inherently complicated and dependent on our customers\u2019 internal processes, thus, there may be uncertainty as to some components of measurement. Also, some variable considerations can be highly susceptible to delays in the customer measurement of key factors such as reporting volumes results and level of yield. Therefore, we may have to estimate revenue related to contingent variable fees or usage-based or sales-based royalties prior to the receipt of performance reports, such as Gainshare acknowledgements, or other related information from customers. These estimates are subject to judgment to evaluate whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods, which could result in our recognition of less Integrated Yield Ramp revenue than expected in any particular period and later offset when actual results become available.\nWe have customers with past due receivable balances and our failure to collect a significant portion of such balances could adversely affect our cash, require us to write-off receivables, or increase our bad debt allowance.\nIf we fail to collect receivable balances when due, our cash will decrease and we may have to write-off a portion or all of such receivables or increase our bad debt allowance. Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $40.7 million and $51.6 million as of December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Three customers accounted for 53% of our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019 and two customers accounted for 56% our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018, and one customer accounted for 31%, and 37% of our revenues for 2019, and 2018, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.2 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We generally do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. Despite the financial ability of these customers to pay for on-going services by PDF under valid contracts, customers may delay payments. Our allowances for potential credit losses, if any, could be insufficient, and we may need to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts from current estimates or write-off receivables depending on such claims in the future. If we are forced to pursue legal remedies to collect receivables, our business relationship and future business with these customers could suffer.\nWe have experienced losses in the past and we may incur losses again in the future.\nWe have experienced losses in the past, and we may incur losses again in the future if we are not able to adequately control our costs or if total revenues fail to exceed costs. In addition, virtually all of our quarterly operating expenses are fixed, so any shortfall in anticipated quarterly revenues could significantly reduce our operating results below expectations. Our accumulated deficit was $35.9 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with:\n\u2022\nfunding for research and development;\n\u2022\nrestructuring costs related to our cost control and management efforts;\n\u2022\nexpansion of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022\nadditional non-cash charges relating to amortization and stock-based compensation.\nOur technologies could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights.\nSignificant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the semiconductor industry. It is possible that a third party may claim that our technologies infringe their intellectual property rights or misappropriate their trade secrets. For example, in 2019, one of our Exensio customers notified us that they had been named in a lawsuit alleging, among other things, that their use of Exensio Control Distributed infringed the patent of a third party. Any claim, even if without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us in connection with the use of our technologies could adversely affect our business.\nChanges in effective tax rates could positively affect our earnings, thereby raising investors\u2019 expectations, while the final tax rates that are determined could be significantly higher, thereby lowering our earnings and causing us to miss investors\u2019 expectations, which could cause our stock price to drop.\nWe conduct our business globally and, as a result, are subject to taxation in the United States and foreign countries. Our future tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including recent changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, insufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in accounting policies. Our filings are subject to reviews or audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We cannot be sure that any final determination in an audit would not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit, there could be a significant negative effect on our income tax provision and our operating results in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions, including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments, could materially increase our effective tax rate.\nFuture events may impact our deferred tax asset position, including the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nIf our judgment and assumptions about our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence fails to change to reflect changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results, we may not be able to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as we expect. If the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, is later adjusted (either by an increase or a decrease), the deferred tax asset valuation allowance may change and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies, including our company. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of a company. Such proposals may disrupt our business, increase our expenses, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. A proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could also require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.", "PERMNO": 89044, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PDFS"}
