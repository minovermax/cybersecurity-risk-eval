{"cik": "36047", "company": "CORELOGIC, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisk Related to the Proposed Merger\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to approval of our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all.\nIn February 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with the Acquirer and Acquisition Sub. Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and the expiration of applicable waiting periods or clearance of the Merger, as applicable, under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of certain other jurisdictions, (iii) absence of any law or order issued by certain governmental authorities of competent jurisdiction, prohibiting the Merger, and (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect on CoreLogic.\nIn addition, while the Merger is not subject to a financing condition, the Acquirer will need to obtain debt financing in order to satisfy its payment obligations and pay other costs and expenses related to the Merger. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Acquirer has obtained a debt commitment letter from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.5 billion, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter.\nWe intend to pursue the satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of each condition to the consummation of the Merger, including the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval. However, no assurance can be given that such conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied or waived in a timely manner, or at all. We also cannot provide any assurance regarding whether CoreLogic will have to comply with any terms or conditions imposed by third parties in order to satisfy or waive the conditions to the consummation of the Merger. Similarly, we cannot provide any assurance that the Acquirer will be able to satisfy the conditions set forth in its debt commitment letter or otherwise procure sufficient financing to comply with its obligation to consummate the Merger. Many of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict if or when these conditions will be satisfied or waived.\nThe failure to satisfy or obtain waiver of conditions to the consummation of the Merger in a timely manner could delay the consummation of the Merger and exacerbate the risks and uncertainties associated with the announcement and pendency of the Merger, which are discussed below under the headings \u201cThe announcement of the Merger Agreement and pendency of the Merger could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations\u201d and \u201cWhile the Merger remains pending, we will be required to comply with various interim operating covenants that may constrain our business operations and to take certain actions that may divert our management\u2019s focus from our ongoing business.\u201d\nIn addition, if all of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger are not satisfied or waived, we may be unable to consummate the Merger at all. The risks and uncertainties associated with a failure to consummate the Merger are discussed below under the heading \u201cFailure to consummate the Merger could adversely affect our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operation.\u201d\nFuture litigation challenging the Merger could prevent the Merger from occurring or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with the announcement of the Merger Agreement, as is common in the context of mergers and acquisitions of publicly-traded companies, CoreLogic (along with our directors and officers) may attract lawsuits seeking to enjoin us from proceeding with or consummating the Merger, or seeking to have the Merger rescinded after its consummation. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is the absence of any order issued by certain governmental authorities of competent jurisdiction prohibiting the Merger. If any future plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction or other order prohibiting the Merger, we may be unable to consummate the Merger. The risks and uncertainties associated with a failure to consummate the Merger are discussed below under the heading \u201cFailure to consummate the Merger could adversely affect our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operation.\u201d\nIn addition, responding to any litigation targeting the Merger, even those without merit, will cause us to incur legal costs and expenses, which may negatively impact our financial condition. Responding to lawsuits may also divert the time and attention of our management away from our ongoing business operations and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNo lawsuits challenging the Merger have been filed as of February 23, 2021.\nFailure to consummate the Merger could adversely affect our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs noted above, the various conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner, or at all. Some of these conditions are not within our control. We cannot provide assurance that any of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied or waived. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger will not be consummated until all of the conditions are satisfied or waived.\nIn addition, either CoreLogic or the Acquirer may terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, including if (i) the Merger has not been consummated by August 9, 2021, (ii) any of certain governmental authorities of competent jurisdiction has issued a final non-appealable law or order prohibiting the Merger, (iii) the Requisite Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the stockholders\u2019 meeting duly convened therefor, or (iv) the other party materially breaches, and does not cure, any of its representations or covenants in the Merger Agreement that would cause the related condition to such party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger to not be satisfied, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions, and other circumstances under which the Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms are described in more detail in the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on February 8, 2021.\nIf the Merger is not consummated for any reason, holders of our common stock will not receive the Merger Consideration for their shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of our common stock. In addition, we would be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the completion of the Merger on the anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining required stockholder and regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other conditions to the completion of the acquisition;\n\u2022the ability of Stone Point Capital Partners and Insight Partners to obtain the necessary financing arrangements set forth in the commitment letters received in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against Stone Point Capital Partners, Insight Partners, CoreLogic or their respective directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto;\n\u2022the risk that disruptions from the Merger will harm CoreLogic\u2019s business, including current plans and operations;\n\u2022the ability of CoreLogic to retain and hire key personnel;\n\u2022potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger;\n\u2022continued availability of capital and financing and rating agency actions;\n\u2022legislative, regulatory and economic developments;\n\u2022potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger that could affect CoreLogic\u2019s financial performance;\n\u2022certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact CoreLogic\u2019s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions;\n\u2022unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including but not limited to acts of terrorism, outbreaks of war or hostilities or the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management\u2019s response to any of the aforementioned factors;\n\u2022the possibility that the Merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; and\n\u2022the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger, including in circumstances requiring CoreLogic to pay a termination fee.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, the risk and uncertainties described above may materialize and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, under certain conditions, we may be obligated to pay the Acquirer a substantial termination fee, which could require us to incur additional debt or reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund our operations.\nIf our Board (i) withdraws or changes its recommendation that our stockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement in a manner adverse to the Acquirer or Acquisition Sub, (ii) fails to include its recommendation in the proxy statement filed by CoreLogic to solicit proxies in connection with the Merger, (iii) approves or recommends a competing acquisition proposal, or (iv) fails to recommend against a competing acquisition proposal under certain circumstances, then the Acquirer will have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement (before the Requisite Stockholder Approval is received) and receive a termination fee in the amount of $165 million (the \u201cCoreLogic Termination Fee\u201d) from CoreLogic, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, we would be required to pay the Acquirer the CoreLogic Termination Fee if prior to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval we terminate the Merger Agreement, and with the authorization of our Board, we enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as each term is defined in the Merger Agreement).\nWe would also be required to pay the Acquirer the CoreLogic Termination Fee, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, if (i) a third party makes a Competing Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to us or our stockholders after February 4, 2021, (ii) the Merger Agreement is subsequently terminated by either us or the Acquirer because we did not obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval or by the Acquirer because we knowingly and intentionally breached any covenant or agreement under the Merger Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of any conditions to our obligations to effect the Merger, and any such Competing Proposal was not withdrawn at least five business days prior to the event that gave rise to such termination, and (iii) within one year of such termination, we consummate a transaction involving a Competing Proposal or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for the consummation of a Competing Proposal (which is subsequently consummated).\nIf we are required to pay the CoreLogic Termination Fee, we may be required to incur additional debt or use funds that we would otherwise have been able to use for general corporate expenses, capital expenditures or for other purposes.\nThe announcement of the Merger Agreement and pendency of the Merger could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could experience material disruptions due to the announcement of our entry into the Merger Agreement and during the pendency of the Merger. Our current and prospective employees, including certain key personnel, may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with CoreLogic or desire different employment in anticipation of the consummation of the Merger. As a result, we may not be able to retain such employees, find adequate replacements for any employees we are unable to retain, or otherwise recruit new employees to join CoreLogic. The uncertainty caused by the pendency of the Merger could also negatively impact our employees\u2019 performance. If the announcement or pendency of the Merger causes us to lose and be unable to replace our employees, impairs our ability to attract new employees, or negatively affects the performance of our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nIn addition, third parties, including our lenders, vendors and customers, may experience uncertainty regarding our business relationships due to the announcement of our entry into the Merger Agreement and during the pendency of the Merger. As a result, such third parties may seek to terminate or renegotiate our existing business relationships in connection with the potential Merger. Such disruptions to our business relationships could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe announcement of the Merger Agreement may also cause regulators to apply additional scrutiny to our business, potentially increasing our regulatory burden, including costs of compliance. If we are required to expend additional employee time or other resources to address such additional scrutiny or increased regulatory burden, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWhile the Merger remains pending, we will be required to comply with various interim operating covenants that may constrain our business operations and to take certain actions that may divert our management\u2019s focus from our ongoing business.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, during the period between February 4, 2021 and the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Merger or (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement (the \u201cInterim Operating Period\u201d), we agreed to use reasonable best efforts to conduct our business in the ordinary course of business and to not engage in certain types of actions, subject to certain terms, limitations and exceptions. In particular, among other things, we agreed to refrain from taking certain actions without the Acquirer's consent, including (i) making acquisitions and capital expenditures above certain thresholds, (ii) incurring indebtedness above a certain threshold, (iii) granting equity awards other than as specified in the Merger Agreement, (iv) entering into, amending or terminating certain material contracts, and (v) declaring or paying dividends to stockholders, in each case subject to the terms, limitations and exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Complying with these obligations could limit our ability to operate our business as previously conducted, to pursue strategic transactions, or to otherwise exploit business opportunities as they arise. Our management will be primarily responsible for ensuring that CoreLogic complies with such obligations during the Interim Operating Period, and this additional responsibility may divert the focus of our management away from our ongoing business operations.\nIn addition, our management will also need to take certain other actions during the Interim Operating Period in connection with the proposed Merger, including, among other things, convening a meeting of our stockholders for the purpose of considering and voting on the Merger, filing a proxy statement, in both preliminary and definitive form, in connection with our solicitation of proxies from our stockholders for such meeting, using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents and approvals required in connection with the Merger and to satisfy the other conditions to the consummation of the Merger, addressing any litigation brought against CoreLogic in connection with the Merger, and responding to questions we may receive from our stockholders, employees, vendors and other interested stakeholders regarding the Merger. Taking these actions could require our management to expend time and resources, reducing the time and resources our management could otherwise direct towards our ongoing business operations. If our management is unable to expend the necessary time and resources on our business, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to make a superior acquisition proposal.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain customary restrictions on our ability to solicit proposals from third parties for an acquisition of CoreLogic during the Interim Operating Period. In addition, subject to certain customary \u201cfiduciary out\u201d exceptions, the Board is required to recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nAs discussed in further detail above under the heading \u201cIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, under certain conditions, we may be obligated to pay the Acquirer a substantial termination fee, which could require us to incur additional debt or reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund our operations,\u201d we would also be required to pay the Acquirer the CoreLogic Termination Fee under certain conditions in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThese provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an acquisition of CoreLogic, including proposals that may be deemed to offer greater value to our stockholders than the Merger Consideration of $80.00 per share. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, the requirement that we must pay a termination fee to accept any such proposal may cause that third party to offer a lower price to our stockholders than such third party might otherwise have offered.\nActions of activist shareholders or other parties may impair our ability to consummate the Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nRecently, we were the target of a proxy contest by Senator and Cannae in connection with their Unsolicited Proposal to acquire us. While Senator and Cannae ultimately terminated their offer, they initiated a proxy contest in July 2020 that resulted in the removal of three members of our Board and the appointment of three of Senator and Cannae\u2019s nominees to our Board in November 2020. Additionally, on February 12, 2021, Pentwater Capital Management LP (\"Pentwater\") submitted the nomination of Matthew Halbower, Chief Executive Officer of Pentwater, for election to the Company's Board and announced that Pentwater may begin a consent solicitation to remove existing members of the Board in certain circumstances.\nFuture actions taken by these or other activist shareholders could impair our ability to satisfy conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, or otherwise preclude us from consummating the Merger. Such activist shareholders could also take actions that disrupt our business, divert the time and attention of management and our\nemployees away from our business operations, cause us to incur substantial additional expense, create perceived uncertainties among current and potential customers, clients, suppliers, employees and other constituencies as to our future direction as a consequence thereof, which may result in lost sales or other business arrangements and the loss of potential business opportunities, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nActions that our Board has taken, and may take in the future, in response to any offer or other related actions by Senator and Cannae, Pentwater, or any other offer or proposal by activist stockholders, may result in litigation against us, which could also be a significant distraction for our management and employees and may require us to incur significant costs or otherwise result in an adverse effect on the Company. In addition, actual or perceived actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Data Access and Security\nA cyber-based attack, data corruption, network security breach, or inability to secure the electronic transmission of sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit, and store electronic information. We have experienced cyber-based attacks and security breaches of varying degrees to our infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, spoofed or manipulated electronic communications and similar breaches, which have in the past, and may in the future, create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information and consumer data, or loss of other company assets. Unauthorized access, including through use of fraudulent schemes such as \"phishing,\" could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user's computer. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern. Despite our physical security, implementation of technical controls and contractual precautions to identify, detect, and prevent the unauthorized access to and alteration and disclosure of our data, we cannot protect the systems that access our services and databases from all compromises or disruptions, whether as a result of criminal conduct, distributed denial of service attacks or other advanced persistent attacks by malicious actors, including hackers, nation states and criminals, breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions. Several highly publicized data incidents and cyberattacks have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems. Cyber attackers are also developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems, but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities. If we are unable to protect against, mitigate, or timely respond to cyber-based attacks or other security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, lawsuits, or other regulatory restrictions or penalties.\nData security and integrity concerns have caused a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies to impose consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy, and security of such data are possible. In the US, federal and state laws provide for a regulatory landscape of disparate notification regimes and, therefore, regulatory compliance in the event of unauthorized access would be expensive and difficult. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability through federal or state enforcement, reputational harm, or private class actions. Likewise, our clients are increasingly imposing more stringent contractual obligations on us relating to our information security protections. If we are unable to maintain protections and processes at a level commensurate with that required by our clients, it could negatively affect our relationships with those clients or increase our operating costs.\nOur use and collection of personal information exposes us to increased regulatory and compliance costs as well as possible litigation, liability, and reputational damage.\nWe acquire, store, use, and provide many types of consumer data and related services, and our databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers. Public concern is high with regard to the collection, use, accuracy, correction, and sharing of personal information, including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, financial information, and other behavioral data. In addition, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, legislatures, and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect consumer privacy and have become increasingly concerned with the collection and use of personal information. Highly publicized data incidents have resulted in significantly increased legislative and regulatory activity at the federal and state levels as lawmakers and regulators continue to propose a wide range of further restrictions on the collection, dissemination or commercial use of personal information, information security standards, and data security incident disclosure standards.\nBecause our databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers, we are subject to government regulation and potential adverse publicity concerning our use of consumer data. The consumer data we acquire, store, use, and provide subject us to regulation under the FCRA, the GLBA, the CCPA, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, and various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Such data may also be subject to data privacy laws in international jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and certain countries in Europe. These jurisdictions have imposed increasingly stringent requirements for data collection, including restrictions on cross-border data transfers. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of consumers and to prevent the unauthorized access and misuse of personal information in the marketplace. The CCPA, for example, which became effective January 1, 2020, imposes new obligations on certain companies doing business in California with respect to the personal information of California residents. This includes new notice and privacy policy requirements, and new obligations to respond to requests to know and access to personal information, to delete personal information, and to say no to the sale of personal information. We expect that there will continue to be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulations similar to the GDPR and the CCPA that give consumers more control over their data. Compliance with these laws imposes significant regulatory burdens and costs on us. Further, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy, and security of such data are possible. In the US, state laws provide for disparate notification regimes. In addition, if our practices or products are deemed to be an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, we may be subject to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm, or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Our failure to comply with these laws, or any future laws or regulations of a similar nature, could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense, and loss of revenue.\nWe rely on the ability to access data from external sources at reasonable terms and prices.\nWe rely extensively upon data from a variety of external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data from third-party suppliers, various government and public record sources and data contributed by our clients. Our data sources could cease providing or reduce the availability of their data to us, increase the price we pay for their data, or limit our use of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially-imposed restrictions on use. If a significant supplier is no longer able or is unwilling to provide us with certain data, or if our public record sources of data become unavailable or too expensive, we may need to find alternative sources. If we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and efficiently and effectively integrate these data sources into our service offerings, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs, and reduced quality and availability of our services. Moreover, some of our data suppliers compete with us in certain product offerings, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases from them, and they may elect to stop providing data to us. Significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and our financial position, in particular if we are unable to arrange for substitute replacement sources of data on favorable economic terms. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable. Loss of such access or the availability of data in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all may reduce the quality and availability of our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, because some of our data suppliers face similar regulatory requirements as we do with respect to their data, their compliance with laws and regulations protecting the privacy of consumers and the unauthorized access and misuse of personal information may cause them to cease to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data, which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to offer our products and services. Many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators are also seeking further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors as well as contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours and those provided by our data suppliers. Any future laws, regulations, or other restrictions limiting the dissemination or use of personal information may reduce the quality and availability of the data necessary for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSystems interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services.\nWe depend on reliable, stable, efficient, and uninterrupted operation of our technology network, systems, and data centers to provide service to our clients. System interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services, resulting in a loss of clients and a corresponding loss in revenue. Historically, our technology infrastructure has run primarily in a private dedicated cloud-based environment hosted in NTT's technology center in Quincy, WA. In fiscal 2020, we successfully completed the initial phase of our transformation to a cloud-based environment hosted by GCP, and will continue transitioning our technology over the foreseeable future on an opportunistic basis. We cannot be sure that certain systems interruptions or events beyond our control, including issues with NTT's technology center or our third-party network and infrastructure providers, including GCP,\nin connection with our upgrading, transitioning, or changing key systems, will not interrupt or terminate the delivery of our products and services to our clients. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers' ability to provide necessary data to us and our employees' ability to attend to work and perform their responsibilities. Any of these possible outcomes could result in a loss of clients or a loss in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe are subject to significant government regulations.\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. See Item 1. Business - \u201cRegulation\u201d in this Form 10-K for a summary of the material US and foreign consumer and data protection laws and regulations to which we are subject. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to provide certain services or result in the imposition of fines and penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and loss of revenue. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in our attempt to ensure compliance with these laws. See also \u201cWe could be adversely affected if personal information on consumers that we maintain is improperly disclosed.\u201d\nOur businesses are also subject to an increasing degree of compliance oversight by regulators and by our clients. Specifically, the CFPB has authority to enact rules affecting the business of consumer reporting agencies and also to supervise, conduct examinations of, and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations with respect to certain \u201clarger participants\u201d that offer consumer financial products and services. Two of our credit businesses, CoreLogic Credco and Teletrack, are subject to the CFPB non-bank supervision program, and the CFPB or other regulatory bodies could attempt to assert authority over other products or services. The CFPB and the prudential financial institution regulators such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) also have the authority to examine us in our role as a service provider for certain services, including for tax services, to large financial institutions. In addition, several of our largest bank clients are subject to consent orders with the OCC and/or are parties to the National Mortgage Settlement, both of which require them to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their key vendors such as us. The CFPB may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce the laws and rules subject to its jurisdiction. In these proceedings the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders, which can include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts, as well as other types of affirmative relief, and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations and up to $1.0 million per day for knowing violations.\nThese laws and regulations as well as laws and regulations in the various states or in other countries could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in, impose additional costs or restrictions on us, result in significant loss of revenue, impact the value of assets we hold, or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations could also result in significant liability to us, including liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation, or may result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. Our operations could also be negatively affected by changes to laws and regulations and enhanced regulatory oversight of our clients and us. These changes may compel us to change our prices, may restrict our ability to implement price increases, and may limit the manner in which we conduct our business or otherwise may have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues, earnings, and cash flows. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to the new laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative impact on our clients, we may experience client losses or increased operating costs, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe rely on our top ten clients for a significant portion of our revenue.\nOur ten largest clients generated approximately 34.4% of our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, although none of our largest clients individually accounted for greater than 10% of our operating revenues for that period. We expect that a limited number of our clients will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future, and that our concentration of revenue may continue to be significant or increase. These clients face continued pressure in the current economic and regulatory climate. Many of our relationships with these clients are long-standing and are important to our future operating results, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements or maintain our relationships on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, in response to increased regulatory oversight, clients in the mortgage lending industry may have internal policies that require them to use multiple vendors or service providers, thereby causing a diversification of revenue among many vendors. Deterioration in or termination of any of these relationships, including through\nvendor diversification policies or merger or consolidation among our clients, could significantly reduce our revenue and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, certain of our businesses have higher client concentration than our company as a whole. As a result, these businesses may be disproportionately affected by declining revenue from, or loss of, a significant client.\nWe operate in a competitive business environment that is impacted by technology advancements or new product development.\nThe markets for our products and services are intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. We compete for existing and new clients against both third parties and the in-house capabilities of our clients. Many of our competitors have substantial resources. Some have widely-used technology platforms that they seek to use as a competitive advantage to drive sales of other products and services. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. These competitors and new technologies may be disruptive to our existing technology or service offerings, resulting in operating inefficiencies and increased competitive pressure. In order to compete with current and future technologies, we must continuously improve our network operating systems, programming tools, programming languages, operating systems, data matching, data filtering, and other database technologies. These improvements, as well as changes in client preferences or regulatory requirements, may require changes in the technology used to gather and process our data and deliver our services. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to internally develop and implement new and competitive technologies, respond to changing client needs and regulatory requirements, and transition clients and data sources successfully to new interfaces or other technologies.\nIn addition, many of our products and services compete within markets characterized by frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and services, our products and services could become commercially obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to properly identify client needs; innovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications; successfully commercialize new products and services in a timely manner; produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings; price our products competitively, including taking into account changes in sales and use tax laws; and anticipate our competitors\u2019 development of new products, services, or technological innovations.\nWe cannot provide assurance that there will be market demand for our future product offerings or that we will successfully implement new technologies, cause clients or data furnishers to implement compatible technologies or adapt our technology to evolving client, regulatory and competitive requirements. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively allocate capital to new product development to create competitive products, as compared to our peers and new market entrants. Failure to launch new and differentiated products will have an adverse effect on our growth and our business. If we fail to respond, or fail to cause our clients or data furnishers to respond, to changes in technology, regulatory requirements or client preferences, the demand for our services, the delivery of our services or our market reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur reliance on outsourcing arrangements subjects us to risk and may disrupt or adversely affect our operations.\nWe have outsourced various business process and information technology services to third parties, including the technology infrastructure management services agreement we entered into with NTT, the cloud services agreement we entered into with GCP, and the outsourcing arrangements we entered into with a subsidiary of Cognizant Technology Solutions, an affiliate of EPAM Systems, and affiliates of Tata Consultancy Services. Although we have service-level arrangements with our providers, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. In addition, the failure to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third-party vendors could subject us to additional risk. Reliance on third parties also makes us vulnerable to changes in the vendors\u2019 business, financial condition, and other matters outside of our control, including their violations of laws or regulations which could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business. The failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations and to the services we provide to our clients, which could materially and adversely affect our business, client relationships, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.\nCertain outsource arrangements contemplate the utilization of lower-cost labor outside the US in countries such as India, Poland, Ukraine, Mexico, and the Philippines. It is possible that the countries where our outsourcing vendors are located may be subject to higher degrees of political and social instability than the US and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest, natural disasters, health crises, or other events impacting the local workforce. Such disruptions could impact our ability to deliver our products and services on a timely basis, if at all, and to a lesser extent could decrease efficiency and increase our costs. Fluctuations of the US dollar in relation to the currencies used and higher inflation rates experienced in these countries may also reduce the savings we planned to achieve. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has\ncome under increased scrutiny in the US, and as a result, many of our clients may require us to use labor based in the US. We may not be able to pass on the increased costs of higher-priced US-based labor to our clients, which ultimately could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the US or the foreign countries in which we have service provider arrangements or operate could adopt new legislation or regulations that would adversely affect our business by making it difficult, more costly or impossible for us to continue our foreign activities as currently being conducted. Furthermore, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). Any violations of the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or the perception of its effects, will impact our business depends on future developments that are highly uncertain.\nThe global coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic and the mitigation efforts by governments to attempt to control its spread have adversely impacted the global economy, leading to business disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets. Many of our clients, and therefore certain of our businesses and revenues, are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions. With respect to the housing market in particular, although the current interest rate environment is conducive to mortgage activity, other market factors, including availability of funds for mortgage loans, housing supply, employment levels, actions by the Federal Reserve, and the overall state of the US economy, could adversely impact sales of new and existing homes and other activities relevant to the markets we serve. Further deteriorations in economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, has led to, and may continue to lead to, a decline in demand for certain of our products and services and has, and may continue to, negatively impact our business.\nAs a result of business disruptions caused by COVID-19, we experienced temporary slowdowns in service from some of our service providers, such as domestic county records offices and certain of our international suppliers during the transition to a work-from-home environment. Further, decreased morale resulting from ongoing work-from-home, social distancing measures and other restrictions implemented in response to COVID-19 have, and may continue to, make it more difficult to motivate and retain qualified employees. We cannot predict the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting economic impact, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, we may experience operational issues or financial losses due to a number of factors, including increased cyber fraud risk related to COVID-19, continued volatility in mortgage transactions, disruptions to operations as a result of issues with our outsource providers or data sources, and concerns related to the ability to collect payments on a timely basis from clients. The adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and challenging to predict, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, the impact of mutated variants, uncertainties surrounding the timing of vaccine rollouts, public acceptance and usage of vaccines and the effectiveness of vaccines in limiting the spread of COVID-19.\nWe have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets, and an extended economic downturn or troubled mortgage market could cause these investments to become impaired.\nGoodwill was $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. Other intangible assets, net were $320.9 million. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors that may indicate the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future results of operations, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends, including a troubled mortgage market. However, if there is an extended economic downturn in the future, the carrying amount of our goodwill or other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, and we may be required to record an impairment charge. In the event that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, any such impairment would be charged against earnings in the period of impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe operate our business in international markets.\nIn 2020, we derived approximately 11% of our revenues from our operations outside of the US and we intend to continue to expand our international operations. We expect to continue to add personnel internationally to expand our abilities to deliver\ndifferentiated services to our international clients. Expansion into international markets may require significant resources and management's attention and will subject us to new regulatory, economic, and political risks. There can be no assurance that our products or services will be accepted in any particular international market or that our international expansion efforts will be successful. The results of our operations and our growth rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors arising out of international commerce, some of which are beyond our control, including currency rate fluctuations, foreign laws and regulatory requirements, trade protection measures, increased data privacy and consumer protection regulations, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, restrictions on the import and export of technologies, political and economic conditions in foreign countries, and reduced protection for intellectual property rights.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe could infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nAs we continue to develop and expand our products and services, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims from third parties such as non-practicing entities, software providers, and suppliers of data. Likewise, if we are unable to maintain adequate controls over how third-party software and data are used, we may be subject to claims of infringement. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could:\n\u2022be expensive and time-consuming to defend;\n\u2022cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022require us to redesign our applications, if feasible;\n\u2022divert management's attention and resources;\n\u2022require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies; and\n\u2022subject us to significant damages, penalties, fines, and costs associated with an adverse judgment or settlement.\nWe rely upon intellectual property rights to protect our, proprietary technology and information.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from complying with our covenants and obligations under our outstanding debt instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $1.9 billion, and we had unused commitments of approximately $450.0 million under our Revolving Facility. Subject to the limitations contained in the Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities and our other debt instruments, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could increase. Specifically, our level of debt could have important consequences to us, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and compromising our flexibility to capitalize our business opportunities and to plan for, or react to, competitive pressures and changes in our business or market conditions.\nThe Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities imposes operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions include the financial covenants in our credit facilities, which require ongoing compliance with certain financial tests and ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio, and could limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022create, incur or assume additional debt;\n\u2022create, incur or assume certain liens;\n\u2022redeem and/or prepay certain subordinated debt we might issue in the future;\n\u2022pay dividends on our stock or repurchase stock;\n\u2022make certain investments and acquisitions, including joint ventures;\n\u2022enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022enter into new lines of business;\n\u2022engage in consolidations, mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022engage in specified sales of assets; and\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could negatively impact our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition, or other corporate opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us. Our failure to comply with these restrictions could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all our debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default; the lenders under our credit facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and could terminate their revolving commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nRisks Related to Business Acquisitions\nOur acquisition and integration of businesses may involve increased expenses and may not produce the desired financial or operating results.\nWe have acquired and expect to continue to acquire, on an opportunistic basis, companies, businesses, products and services. These activities may increase our expenses, and the expected results, synergies, and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned. While management believes that acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, no assurance can be given that acquisitions will be successful or accretive to earnings. For a description of our recent acquisitions, see Note 17 - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may have difficulty integrating our completed or any future acquisitions into our operations, including implementing controls, procedures, and policies. If we fail to properly integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies, and personnel, it could impair relationships with employees, clients and strategic partners, distract management attention from our core businesses, result in control failures and otherwise disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. We also may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition. Although part of our business strategy may include growth through strategic acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain the capital necessary to pursue acquisitions or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms in the future. In addition, we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and an impairment of these investments would require a write-down that would reduce our net income. See \u201cWe have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets, and an extended economic downturn or troubled mortgage market could cause these investments to become impaired.\u201d\nRisks Related to Takeover Attempts\nThe shareholder rights plan adopted by our Board of Directors may impair a takeover attempt.\nOn July 6, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted the Rights Agreement.\nPursuant to the Rights Agreement, on July 6, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right (a \u201cRight\u201d) for each outstanding share of our common stock to shareholders of record on July 17, 2020. Each Right entitles its holder to purchase from us, when exercisable and subject to adjustment, a unit (\u201cUnit\u201d) consisting of one one-thousandth of a\nshare of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, at an exercise price of $308.00 per Unit (the \u201cpurchase price\u201d).\nUnder the Rights Agreement, the Rights will generally be exercisable only in the event that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (such person or group being an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d), other than certain exempt persons, acquires beneficial ownership of ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock (or twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock in the case of passive institutional investors reporting beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G). In such case, subject to certain exceptions specified in the Rights Agreement, each holder of a Right (other than the Acquiring Person, whose Rights would become null and void) will have the right to receive, upon payment of the purchase price, common stock (or, in certain circumstances, other securities, cash, or other assets of the Company) having a value equal to two (2) times the purchase price.\nIn the event that, at any time after a person or group has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the Company is not the continuing or surviving corporation, (ii) the Company engages in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation and the shares of common stock of the Company are changed or exchanged or (iii) fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company\u2019s assets, cash flow or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a Right (other than the Acquiring Person, whose Rights would become null and void) would thereafter have the right to receive, upon payment of the purchase price, common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two (2) times the purchase price.\nOur Board of Directors may redeem the Rights for $0.001 per Right, subject to adjustment, at any time until the earlier of 10 business days following a public announcement that an Acquiring Person has become such or the expiration of the Rights Agreement. The Rights will expire on July 6, 2021, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, exchanged or terminated.\nThe Rights Agreement is intended to enable all of our stockholders to realize the value of their investment in the Company, ensure that all stockholders receive fair treatment, and provide our Board of Directors and stockholders with adequate time to make informed decisions. The Rights Agreement is not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company and should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by our Board of Directors. However, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement may render it more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer or other business combination involving the Company that is not supported by our Board of Directors, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. These deterrents could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOn February 4, 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into the Rights Agreement Amendment in order to (i) render the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) ensure that in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, none of the Acquirer, Acquisition Sub, or any of their \u201cAffiliates\u201d or \u201cAssociates\u201d (each as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall be deemed to be or become an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d (as defined below) and (iii) provide that the \u201cExpiration Date\u201d (as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall occur immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur revenue is affected by the strength of the economy, interest rate environment and the housing market generally.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from solutions we provide to the mortgage, consumer lending, and real estate industries and, as a result, a weak economy or housing market or adverse changes in the interest rate environment may adversely affect our business. A large portion of our client base suffers when financial markets experience volatility, illiquidity, and disruption, which has occurred in the past and which could reoccur, and any future disruptions of the financial markets presents considerable risks to our business and revenue. The volume of mortgage origination and residential real estate transactions is highly variable. Reductions in these transaction volumes have had, and will continue to have, a direct impact on certain portions of our revenues and may materially adversely affect our business. Negative economic conditions or increasing interest rate environments has resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in volumes, pricing, and operating margins for our services. If our clients in the mortgage consumer lending and real estate industries experience economic hardship, in particular if these clients go bankrupt or otherwise exit certain businesses, it may negatively impact our revenue, earnings, and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to attract, train, motivate, and retain qualified personnel and senior management.\nWe rely on skilled and qualified, high-performing personnel, and our success depends on our ability to attract, train, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of such individuals. If we are unsuccessful in further developing and implementing recruitment,\nretention, and other initiatives to manage and develop our human capital, including in the areas of diversity and inclusion and training and development, our attrition rate may increase, and our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. We compete for talented individuals not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services, and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of individuals who have the skills and training needed to grow our company, especially in the increasingly-regulated environment in which we operate. Increased attrition or competition for qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and product offerings, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.\nIn addition, our success and growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of our senior management team, who have extensive market knowledge and relationships, and exercise substantial influence over our operational, financing, and strategic activities. Members of our senior management team have national and/or regional industry reputations that attract business opportunities and assist us in negotiations with customers, suppliers, regulators, and other industry participants. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain similarly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities and weaken our business relationships, which could have a material adverse effect on us.", "PERMNO": 35124, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "CLGX"}
