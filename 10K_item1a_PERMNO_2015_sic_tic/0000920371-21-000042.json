{"cik": "920371", "company": "Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully review the following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report, for important information regarding risks that affect us. Current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks that may affect us. Additional risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar health concerns, could have a significant effect on supply and/or demand for our products and services and have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with a pandemic, or outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. Notwithstanding our level of continued operations, the COVID-19 pandemic may have negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may compress our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries and could result in an economic downturn. Any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, demand for our products, services, and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products, services and raw materials.\nIn addition, the ability of our employees and our suppliers' and customers' employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19, or as a result of the control measures noted above, which may significantly hamper our production throughout the supply chain and constrict distribution channels. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or\nmitigate its effects and we are unable to predict the potential future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in government and industry regulatory standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernment regulations pertaining to health and safety and environmental concerns continue to emerge, domestically as well as internationally, including regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These regulations include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other worker safety regulations for the protection of employees, as well as regulations for the protection of consumers. It is necessary for us to comply with current requirements (including requirements that do not become effective until a future date), and even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our products or processes. Compliance with these regulations may require us to alter our manufacturing processes and our sourcing. For example, at our manufacturing locations we use enhanced cleaning processes, established health screening procedures, modified work stations and material flows with established social distancing practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as local and state health departments. Such actions could increase our capital expenditures and other similar expenses and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations, and our inability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position.\nRisks Related To Our Business And Our Industry\nBusiness cycles and uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our total product sales is dependent on housing starts. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations depends significantly on the stability of the housing and residential construction and home improvement markets, which are affected by conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. These conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022uncertainty about the housing and residential construction and home improvement markets;\n\u2022consumer confidence and spending;\n\u2022unemployment levels;\n\u2022foreclosure rates;\n\u2022interest rates;\n\u2022raw material, logistics and energy costs;\n\u2022labor and healthcare costs;\n\u2022capital availability, or lack thereof, to builders, developers and consumers;\n\u2022the state of the credit markets, including mortgages and home equity loans;\n\u2022unfavorable weather conditions and natural disasters; and\n\u2022acts of terrorism.\nThese factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, many of our customers in the construction industry are small and medium-sized businesses that are more likely to be adversely affected by economic downturns than larger, more established businesses. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions may cause these consumers to postpone or refrain from spending or may cause them to switch to lower-cost alternative products, which could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, declines in commercial and residential construction, such as housing starts and home improvement projects, which generally occur during economic downturns, have in the past significantly reduced, and in the future can be expected to reduce, the demand for our products and services, which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a few large customers, the loss of any one of which could negatively affect our sales and profits.\nOur largest customers accounted for a significant portion of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Any redur4ction in, or termination of, our sales to these customers would at least temporarily, and possibly on a longer term\nbasis, cause a material reduction in our net sales, income from operations and net income. Such a reduction in or elimination of our sales to any of our largest customers would increase our relative dependence on our remaining large customers.\nIn addition, our distributor customers and builders have increasingly consolidated over time, which has increased the material adverse effect risk of losing any one of them and may increase their bargaining power in negotiations with us. These trends could negatively affect our sales and profitability.\nOur growth may depend on our ability to develop new products and services and penetrate new markets, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur continued growth depends upon our ability to develop additional products, services and technologies that meet our customers\u2019 expectations of our brand and quality and that allow us to expand our product and service offerings and enter into new markets. Expansion into new markets and the development of new products and services may involve considerable costs and may not generate sufficient revenue to be profitable or cover the costs of development. We might not be able to penetrate these product markets and any market penetration that occurs might not be timely or profitable. We may be unable to recoup part or all of the investments we make in attempting to develop new products and technologies and penetrate new markets.\nRisks Related to Seasonality and Weather Conditions\nSeasonality and weather-related conditions may have a significant impact on our financial condition from period to period.\nThe demand for our products and services is heavily correlated to both seasonal changes, with operating results varying from quarter to quarter, and unpredictable weather patterns. Our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters, as customers tend to purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season. In addition, weather conditions, such as unseasonably warm, cold or wet weather, which affect, and sometimes delay or accelerate installation of some of our products, may significantly affect our results of operations. Sales that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter, affecting both quarters\u2019 results and potentially our stock price.\nIn addition, we typically ship orders as we receive them and maintain inventory levels to allow us to operate with minimum backlog. The efficiency of our inventory system, and our ability to avoid backlogs and potential loss of customers, is closely tied to our ability to accurately predict seasonal and quarterly variances. Further, our planned expenditures are also based primarily on sales forecasts. When sales do not meet our expectations, our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters, as we will have already incurred expenses based on those expectations. This could result in a material decline in our stock price.\nClimate change, weather conditions and storm activity could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWeather conditions and the level of severe storms can have a significant impact on the markets for residential construction and home improvement. As a result, climate change that results in altered weather conditions or storm activity could have a significant impact on our business by:\n\u2022depressing or reversing economic development;\n\u2022reducing the demand for construction;\n\u2022increasing the cost and reducing the availability of wood products used in construction;\n\u2022increasing the cost and reducing the availability of raw materials and energy;\n\u2022increasing the cost and reducing the availability of insurance covering damage from natural disasters; and\n\u2022lead to new laws and regulations that increase our expenses and reduce our sales.\nGenerally, any weather conditions that slow or limit residential or construction activity can adversely impact demand for our products and services.\nLower demand for our products or services as a result of this scenario could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, severely low temperatures may lead to significant and immediate spikes in costs of natural gas, electricity and other commodities that could negatively affect our results of operation.\nNatural disasters could decrease our manufacturing capacity.\nSome of our manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. Our disaster recovery plan may not be adequate or effective. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Other insurance that we carry is limited in the risks covered and the amount of coverage. Our insurance would not be adequate to cover all of our resulting costs, business interruption and lost profits when a major natural disaster occurs. A natural disaster rendering one or more of our manufacturing facilities totally or partially inoperable, whether or not covered by insurance, would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition in the markets we serve and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nIn order to effectively compete we must continue to develop enhancements to our existing products, new products and services on a timely basis that meet changing consumer preferences and successfully develop, manufacture and market these new products, product enhancements and services. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products, product enhancements, additional technologies and services. Many of our competitors are dedicating increasing resources to competing with us, especially as our products and services become more affected by technological advances and software innovations. Our inability to effectively compete could reduce the sales of our products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our ability to compete effectively depends, to a significant extent, on the specification or approval of our products by architects, engineers, building inspectors, building code officials and customers and their acceptance of our premium brand. If a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design, materials, manufacturing, testing or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors or the cost differences between our products and any competitors are not justifiable, our sales and profits would be materially reduced.\nIncreases in prices of raw materials and energy could negatively affect our sales and profits.\nSteel is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of many of our products. The price of steel has historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and has often depended on a variety of factors over which we have no control. Import tariffs and/or other mandates could significantly increase the prices on raw materials that are critical to our business, such as steel. The cost of producing our products is also sensitive to the price of energy.\nThe selling prices of our products have not always increased in response to raw material, energy or other cost increases, and we are unable to determine to what extent, if any, we will be able to pass future cost increases through to our customers. Our inability to pass increased costs through to our customers could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services and the lack of availability of transportation and/or increases in cost could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the transportation of both finished goods to our customers and distributors and the transportation of raw materials to us. We rely on third parties for transportation services of these items, which services are occasionally in high demand (especially at the end of calendar quarters) and/or subject to price fluctuations.\nIf the required supply of transportation services is unavailable when needed, our manufacturing processes may be interrupted if we are not able to receive raw materials or we may be unable to sell our products at full value, or at all. This could harm our reputation, negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a material increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nProduct, Services and Sales Risks\nProduct liability claims and litigation could affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the products that we design and/or manufacture, and/or the services we provide, have led to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us. To the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product\u2019s design, manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage, or that our provision of\nservices resulted in similar injury or damage, we may be subject to claims for damages. Although we are insured for damages above a certain amount, we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims, including frivolous lawsuits, and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount. The insurance that we carry is limited in the amount of coverage and may not be adequate to cover all of our resulting costs, business interruption and lost profits if we are subject to product liability claims. We might also face increases in premiums and reductions in the availability of insurance covering product liability, which could have a significant impact on our business. In addition to claims concerning individual products, as a manufacturer, we can be subject to costs, potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls, which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation.\nDesign defects, labeling defects, product formula defects, inaccurate chemical mixes, product recalls and/or product liability claims could harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our products are integral to the structural soundness or safety of the structures in which they are used and we have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in the design, manufacturing, assembling, labeling, product formulations, chemical mixes or testing of our products. We also have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in raw materials and finished goods produced by others and used with or incorporated into our products. Some flaws and deficiencies have not been apparent until after the products were installed or used by customers.\nIf any flaws or deficiencies exist in our products and if such flaws or deficiencies are not discovered and corrected before our products are incorporated into structures, the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage, such as collapse or fire, and personal injury or death could result. To the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by our product liability insurance and we are held to be liable, we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury or death, and our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a result of the nature of many of our products and their use in construction projects, claims (including product warranty claims and claims resulting from a natural disaster) may be made against us with regard to damage or destruction of structures incorporating our products whether or not our products failed. Any such claims, if asserted, could require us to expend material time and efforts defending the claim and may materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Costs associated with resolving such claims (such as repair or replacement of the affected parts) could be material and may exceed any amounts reserved in our consolidated financial statements.\nWhile we generally attempt to limit our contractual liability and our exposure to price or expense increases, we may have uncapped liabilities or significant exposure under some contracts, and could suffer material losses under such contracts.\nWe enter into many types of contracts with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, including in connection with our expansion into new markets and new product lines. Under some of these contracts, our overall liability may not be limited to a specified maximum amount or we may have significant potential exposure to price or expense increases. If we receive claims under these contracts or experience significant price increases or comparable expense increases, we may incur liabilities significantly in excess of the revenues associated with such contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of our technology offerings provide planning and design functions to customers, and we are involved both in product sales and engineering services. Any software errors or deficiencies or failures in our engineering services could have material adverse effects on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\nOur planning/design software applications facilitate the creation by customers of complex construction and building designs and is extremely complex. If our software applications contain defects or errors, our engineers prepare, approve or seal drawings that contain defects or we are otherwise involved in any design or construction that contains flaws, regardless of whether we caused such flaws, we may be required to correct deficiencies and may become involved in litigation. Further, if any damage or injury is not covered by our insurance and we are held to be liable, we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury, and our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology\nOur recent efforts to increase our technology offerings and integrate new software and application offerings may prove unsuccessful and may affect our future prospects.\nOur industry has experienced increased complexity in some home design and builders are more aggressively trying to reduce their costs. One of our responses has been to develop and market sophisticated software and applications to facilitate the specification, selection and use of our product systems. We have continued to commit substantial resources to our software development endeavors in recent years and expect that trend to continue in 2021.\nWe may not be able to create and develop commercially successful software and applications. Even if we are able to create and develop initially successful ideas, the technology industry is subject to rapid changes. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to keep up with changing demands, and our software may become obsolete.\nWhile we see having a software interface with the construction industry as a potential growth area, we also face competition from other companies that are focused solely or primarily on the development of software and applications. These companies may have significantly greater expertise and resources to devote to software development, and we may be unable to compete with them in that space.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property, we will not be able to compete effectively.\nWe monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute, or otherwise harm our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property and rely on the patent, trademark and other laws of the U.S. and other countries. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization. To the extent we cannot protect our intellectual property, unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. jurisdictions provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the U.S. and we therefore may not be able to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights in these jurisdictions. If we are unable to maintain certain exclusive licenses, our brand recognition and sales could be adversely impacted. Current employees, contractors and suppliers have, and former employees, contractors and suppliers may have, access to trade secrets and confidential information regarding our operations which could be disclosed improperly and in breach of contract to our competitors or otherwise used to harm us.\nThird parties may also claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to successfully defend or license such alleged infringing intellectual property or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that such intellectual property claims are without merit, defending such claims can be costly, time consuming and require significant resources. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, pay costly damage awards, or face injunctions prohibiting us from manufacturing, importing, marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have agreements to indemnify us, indemnifying parties may be unable or unwilling to do so.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in efforts to minimize those risks and to comply with regulatory standards.\nWe employ information technology systems and operate websites which allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others. We make significant efforts to secure our computer network to mitigate the risk of possible cyber-attacks, including, but not limited to, data breaches, and are continuously working to upgrade our existing information technology systems to ensure that we are protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. Despite these efforts security of our computer networks could be compromised which could impact operations and confidential information could be misappropriated, which could lead to negative publicity, loss of sales and profits or cause us to incur significant costs to reimburse third- parties for damages, which could adversely impact profits.\nAdditionally, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect businesses and personal data, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act. GDPR is a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform, effective in 2018, which applies to companies that are organized in the European Union or otherwise provide services to consumers who reside in the European Union, and imposes strict standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data and significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act creates new data privacy rights, effective in 2020. Any failure to comply with GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other regulatory standards, could subject\nthe Company to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on complex software systems and hosted applications to operate our business, and our business may be disrupted if we are unable to successfully/efficiently update these systems or convert to new systems.\nWe are increasingly dependent on technology systems to operate our business, reduce costs, and enhance customer service. These systems include complex software systems and hosted applications that are provided by third parties such as financial management and human capital management platforms from SAP America, Inc. and Workday, Inc. Software systems need to be updated on a regular basis with patches, bug fixes and other modifications. Hosted applications are subject to service availability and reliability of hosting environments. We also migrate from legacy systems to new systems from time to time. Maintaining existing software systems, implementing upgrades and converting to new systems are costly and require a significant allocation of personnel and other resources. The implementation of these systems upgrades and conversions is a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation activities, consultants, system hardware and software, often requires transforming our current business and financial processes to conform to new systems, and therefore, may take longer, be more disruptive, and cost more than forecast and may not be successful. If the implementation is delayed or otherwise is not successful, it may hinder our business operations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are many factors that may materially and adversely affect the schedule, cost, and execution of the implementation process, including, without limitation, problems during the design and testing phases of new systems; system delays and malfunctions; the deviation by suppliers and contractors from the required performance under their contracts with us; the diversion of management attention from our daily operations to the implementation project; reworks due to unanticipated changes in business processes; difficulty in training employees in the operation of new systems and maintaining internal control while converting from legacy systems to new systems; and integration with our existing systems. Some of such factors may not be reasonably anticipated or may be beyond our control.\nWe have experienced and may in the future experience delays, outages, cyber-based attacks or security breaches in relation to our information systems and computer networks, which have disrupted and may in the future disrupt our operations and may result in data corruption. As a result, our profitability, financial condition and reputation could be negatively affected. In addition, data privacy statements and laws could subject us to liability.\nWe depend on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. We depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and our subsidiaries, customers and suppliers. We collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer, vendor and supplier data, including some personally identifiable information, for business purposes. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, vendor, supplier, employee and other Company data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely affect our business operations.\nDespite the security and maintenance measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of the retailers, dealers, licensees and other third-parties with which we do business, we remain vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, data corruption, delays, disruptions, programming and/or human errors or other similar events, such as those accomplished through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors or other agents or representatives and those due to system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar events. Such incidents have occurred, continue to occur, and may occur in the future.\nSecurity breaches of our infrastructure could create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosures of confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of the retailers, dealers, licensees and other third parties with which we do business, we may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Such incidents may involve misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential data, materials or information, including those concerning our customers, employees or suppliers, whether by us or by the retailers, dealers, licensees and other third-party distributors with which we do business, disrupt our operations, result in losses, damage our reputation, and expose us to the risks of litigation and liability (including regulatory liability); and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information on our websites. If we fail to adhere to our privacy policy and other published statements or applicable laws concerning our processing, use, transmission and disclosure of protected information, or if our statements or practices are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative, we could face regulatory actions, fines and other liability.\nWe may experience delays or outages in our information technology system and computer networks.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by delays or disruptions due to system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar events or disruptions.\nDespite our security measures, our systems could be vulnerable to disruption, and any such disruption could negatively affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our agreements for software and software-as-services products have limited terms, and we may be unable to renew such agreements and may lose access to such products.\nWe have various agreements with a number of third parties that provide software and software-as-a-service products to us. These agreements often require reoccurring payments for online access to the products and have limited terms. In the future, we will be required to renegotiate the terms of these agreements, and may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms. If any such agreement cannot be renewed or can only be renewed on terms that are materially worse for us, we may be unable to access the applicable software, and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nRegulatory Risks\nFailure to comply with industry regulations could result in reduced sales and increased costs.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air, discharges into water, and generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. We are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters.\nOur manufacturing operations involve the use of solvents, chemicals, oils and other materials that are regarded as hazardous or toxic. We also use complex and heavy machinery and equipment that can pose severe safety hazards, especially if not properly and carefully used. Some of our products also incorporate materials that are hazardous or toxic in some forms, such as:\n\u2022zinc and lead used in some steel galvanizing processes;\n\u2022chemicals used in our acrylic and epoxy anchoring products, our concrete repair, strengthening and protecting products; and\n\u2022gun powder used in our powder-actuated tools, which is explosive.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, need to take steps to remedy our failure to properly label, store, transport, use and manufacture such toxic and hazardous materials.\nIf we do not obtain all material licenses and permits required by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we may be subject to regulatory action by governmental authorities. If our policies and procedures are flawed, or our employees fail or neglect to follow our policies and procedures in all respects, we might incur liability. Relevant laws and regulations could change or new ones could be adopted that require us to incur substantial expense to comply.\nComplying or failing to comply with conflict minerals regulations could materially and adversely affect our supply chain, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our financial results.\nWe are currently subject to conflict mineral disclosure regulations in the U.S. and may be affected by new regulations concerning conflict and similar minerals adopted by other jurisdictions where we operate. While we have been successful to date in adapting to such regulations, we have and will continue to incur added costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of such minerals used in our products. We may not be able to ascertain the origins of such minerals that we use and may not be able to satisfy requests from customers to certify that our products are free of conflict minerals. These requirements also could constrain the pool of suppliers from which we source such minerals. We may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices. Such consequences will increase costs and may materially and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and profitability.\nWhen we provide engineering services we are subject to various local, state and federal rules and regulations which can increase our potential liability.\nAs part of our product offerings, we may provide engineering and design-related services to our clients. Some of these services require us to stamp drawings or otherwise be involved in the engineering process. While we generally attempt to limit our liability through our internal processes and through our legal agreements with third parties to which we provide such services, under various local, state and federal rules and regulations these limitations may not be effective and we may be held liable for engineering failures. Any such liability could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nCapital Expenditures, Expansions, Acquisitions and Divestitures Risks\nOur acquisition activities, if any, present unique risks for our business, and any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may consider and evaluate acquisitions and compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers, some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do. Any acquisitions we undertake involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations, products, technologies, services, accounting and employees;\n\u2022diversion of financial and management resources attention from existing operations;\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties integrating geographic regions where we do not have prior experience;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022unforeseen liabilities associated with businesses acquired; and\n\u2022inability to generate sufficient revenue or realize sufficient cost savings to offset acquisition or investment costs.\nAs a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. These risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may involve issuance of additional equity securities that dilute the value of our existing equity securities, increase our debt, cause impairment related to goodwill and cause impairment of, and amortization expenses related to, other intangible assets, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. Productivity improvements through process re-engineering, design efficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, our competitive position may be harmed and we may be unable to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments.\nAdditional financing, if needed, to fund our working capital, growth or other business requirements may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf the cash needed for working capital or to fund our growth or other business requirements increases to a level that exceeds the amount of cash that we generate from operations and have available through our current credit arrangements, we will need to seek additional financing. Additional or new borrowings may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise money by issuing and selling shares of our common or preferred stock depends on general market conditions and the demand for our stock. If we sell stock, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. Our inability to secure additional financing could prevent the expansion of our business, internally and through acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nWe depend on executives and other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business.\nWe depend, in part, on the efforts and skills of our executives and other key employees, including members of our sales force. Our executives and key employees are experienced and highly qualified. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm the business and the Company\u2019s ability to timely achieve its strategic initiatives. Our success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire and retain our key personnel. We face strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, when we experience periods with little or no profits, a decrease in compensation based on our profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We may not be able to attract and retain key personnel or may incur significant costs to do so.\nOur work force could become increasingly unionized in the future and our unionized or union-free work force could strike, which could adversely affect the stability of our production and reduce our profitability.\nA significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire between 2021 and 2023. Generally, collective bargaining agreements that expire may be terminated after notice by the union. After termination, the union may authorize a strike similar to the strike which was initiated at our Stockton facility in the third quarter of 2019. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are generally good, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if the workers covered by one or more of the collective bargaining agreements engage in a strike, lockout, or other work stoppage, we could have a material adverse effect on production at one or more of our facilities, incur higher labor costs, and, depending upon the length of such dispute or work stoppage, on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nInternational operations and our financial results in those markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political, currency exchange and other economic risks.\nDuring 2020, revenue from sales outside of the U.S. was $222.4 million, representing approximately 17.5% of consolidated sales. In addition, a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located outside the U.S. As a result, our business is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex and changing laws, including securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, treaties and regulations;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022adverse domestic or international economic and political conditions, business interruption, war and civil disturbance;\n\u2022changes to tax, currency, or other laws or policies that may adversely impact our ability to repatriate cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, make cross-border investments, or engage in other intercompany transactions;\n\u2022future regulatory guidance and interpretations of the tax legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), as well as assumptions that the Company makes related to the Tax Act;\n\u2022changes to tariffs or other import or export restrictions, penalties or sanctions, including modification or elimination of international agreements covering trade or investment;\n\u2022costs and availability of shipping and transportation;\n\u2022nationalization or forced relocation of properties by foreign governments;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; and\n\u2022uncertainty with respect to any potential changes to laws, regulations and policies that could exacerbate the risks described above.\nAll of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, international construction standards, techniques and methods differ from those in the U.S. and as a result, we may need to redesign our products, or design new products, to compete effectively and profitably in international markets.\nIn addition, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption and we could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making\nimproper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will necessarily prevent violations of these laws by our employees or agents. If we were found to be liable for violations of anti-corruption laws, we could be liable for criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with export, import, and sanctions laws and regulations could affect us materially and adversely.\nWe are subject to a number of export, import and economic sanction regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) and U.S. sanction regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets (\u201cOFAC\u201d). Foreign governments where we have operations also implement export, import and sanction laws and regulations, some of which may be inconsistent or conflict with ITAR and EAR. Where we face such inconsistencies, it may be impossible for us to comply with all applicable regulations.\nIf we do not obtain all necessary import and export licenses required by applicable export and import regulations, including ITAR and EAR, or do business with sanctioned countries or individuals, we may be subject to fines, penalties and other regulatory action by governmental authorities, including, among other things, having our export or import privileges suspended. Even if our policies and procedures for exports, imports and sanction regulations comply, but our employees fail or neglect to follow them in all respects, we might incur similar liability.\nAny changes in applicable export, import or sanction laws or regulations or any legal or regulatory violations could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing facilities in China complicate our supply and inventory management.\nWe maintain manufacturing capability in various parts of the world, including Jiangsu, China, in part to allow us to serve our customers with prompt delivery of needed products. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our manufacturing capabilities in China. Substantially all of our manufacturing output in China was and is currently intended for export to other parts of the world. If a widespread outbreak of an illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, occurred at or near our Jiangsu, China manufacturing facility, it could substantially interfere with our general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. If this outbreak caused us to curtail our operations, we may need to seek alternative sources of supply for products for our customers, which may increase the costs to manufacture and deliver our products.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on our imports or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, our costs of doing business, revenue and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on Chinese or other imports or any related countermeasures are taken by China or other countries, our costs of doing business, revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. If duties are imposed on our imports, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations as we would need to pursue the time-consuming processes of recreating a new supply chain, identifying substitute components and establishing new manufacturing locations.\nWe are subject to U.S. and international tax laws that could affect our financial results.\nWe generally conduct international operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our income tax liabilities in the different countries where we operate depend in part on internal settlement prices and administrative charges among us and our subsidiaries. These arrangements require us to make judgments with which tax authorities may disagree. Tax authorities may impose additional tariffs, duties, taxes, penalties and interest on us. Transactions that we have arranged in light of current tax rules could have material and adverse consequences if tax rules change, and changes in tax rules or imposition of any new or increased tariffs, duties and taxes could materially and adversely affect our sales, profits and financial condition.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations are issued or applied. If the U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nSignificant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Future tax law changes may materially increase the Company\u2019s prospective income tax expense.\nWe are subject to income taxation in the U.S. as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The impact of the Tax Act and any future Treasury rules, regulations or guidance thereunder on our business and our stockholders is uncertain and could be adverse and cause our future results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from our expectations, estimates and assumptions disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAny issuance of preferred stock may dilute your investment and reduce funds available for dividends.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to determine the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of any such series on such terms as our Board of Directors may approve. Any such issuance could be used to impede an acquisition of our business that our Board of Directors does not approve, further dilute the equity investments of holders of our common stock and reduce funds available for the payment of dividends to holders of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. For example, under our charter documents, our stockholders cannot call special meetings and cannot take action by written consent.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder and which may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Delaware law and our corporate governance documents could deter takeover attempts that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIf we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected in a particular period.\nDeclines in the Company\u2019s business may result in an impairment of the Company\u2019s tangible and intangible assets which could result in a material non-cash charge. At least annually, or at other times when events occur that could affect the value of such assets, we perform impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets. To determine whether an impairment has occurred, we compare fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value. In the past, these tests have led us to incur significant impairment charges. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulatory authorities, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, can require a charge for impairment that can negatively impact our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 80575, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "SSD"}
