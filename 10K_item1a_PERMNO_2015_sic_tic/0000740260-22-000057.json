{"cik": "740260", "company": "Ventas, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section discusses material factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected, and the value of our securities could decline.\nAs set forth below, we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories:\n\u2022Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u2022Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy\n\u2022Our Capital Structure Risks\n\u2022Our Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\n\u2022Our REIT Status Risks\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences have materially and negatively impacted our businesses in a number of ways and are expected to continue to do so. For instance, our financial results have been adversely impacted by increased operating costs at our senior housing communities as a result of labor pressures, public health measures and other operational and regulatory dynamics attributable or related to the pandemic and decreased revenues due to a reduction in occupancy in these communities. Many of our tenants, managers and borrowers have also incurred significant costs or losses as a result of the pandemic, and may continue to do so, which increases the risk that they are unable to comply with their obligations to us.\nWe, along with our managers, continue to undertake extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our employees, residents, communities, tenants and buildings, including by coordinating vaccine programs for residents and instituting vaccine requirements for our employees and most employees in our SHOP portfolio. In some circumstances, these vaccine requirements may make it harder for us to hire employees or may make it more expensive for us to do so. Ongoing administration of resident safety programs may contribute to increased labor and other operating costs, including those related to food and wellness services and higher wages from overtime pay.\nThe effects of shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, if re-imposed, and the trend toward increased remote and hybrid work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, increase operational risk, including cybersecurity risk, and impair our ability to manage our business. As a result of the pandemic, our non-field-based employees have shifted to operating in a primarily fully or partially remote working environment. Remote work creates inherent productivity, connectivity and oversight challenges. We may experience increased costs and disruption as we adjust to new or unfamiliar work models. We may face challenges in operating effectively and maintaining our corporate culture.\nSenior housing communities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Lower labor force participation rates and inflationary pressures affecting wages have driven increased labor expenses across senior housing communities, with our tenants, managers and borrowers implementing higher wage rates, more costly overtime and usage of contract labor to address these challenges. Our tenants, managers and borrowers have experienced significant cost increases as a result of increased health and safety measures, increased governmental regulation and compliance, vaccine mandates and other operational changes necessitated either directly or indirectly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these expenses may remain at these higher levels even if the pandemic subsides. Increases in labor or other operating costs would affect the net operating income of our SHOP segment and could affect the ability of our triple-net tenants to make contractual payments to us, which in turn, could adversely affect our triple-net leased segment.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also, to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic, prevented prospective occupants and their families from visiting our senior housing communities and limited the ability of new occupants to move into our senior housing communities. The ongoing impact of the pandemic on occupancy remains uncertain, especially as new strains of COVID-19, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, arise and spread and clinical trends fluctuate. Any decrease in occupancy would affect the net operating income of our SHOP segment and could affect the ability of our triple-net tenants to make contractual payments to us, which in turn, could adversely affect our triple-net leased segment.\nAcross our asset classes, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences create a heightened risk of tenant, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as decreased occupancy, medical practice disruptions resulting from increased hospitalizations or restrictions on elective procedures, increased labor and other operating expenses, difficulty procuring necessary products and services, delays and suspensions in the issuance of permits or other required authorizations and exposure to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments have in the past enacted, and may in the future enact, laws, regulations or moratoriums that limit our ability to terminate a lease, evict a tenant or pursue other remedies where the tenant has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Where such laws, regulations or moratoriums are in effect, we may incur significant costs and it may take a significant amount of time to ultimately evict or pursue remedies against a tenant who is not meeting its contractual rent or other obligations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences have impacted the macroeconomic environment and global financial markets in significant ways, including through increased rates of inflation and interest rates and increasing labor pressure. These consequences have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and that of our tenants, managers and borrowers. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy-Macroeconomic trends including rising labor costs and historically low unemployment, increases in inflation and rising interest rates may adversely affect our business and financial results,\u201d below.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences have exacerbated, and may continue to exacerbate, the magnitude of other risks. Today, the trajectory and future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences remains highly uncertain. This uncertainty itself has impacted our business, including our ability to plan for and execute on strategic initiatives, to take defensive or offensive actions to effectively and efficiently manage risk and to manage the dynamic forces of volatile and tightening labor markets.\nThe extent of the pandemic\u2019s continuing effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the rise of new variants of the COVID-19 virus and the effectiveness of available vaccines and therapeutics\nagainst those variants; the availability and accuracy of testing; the rate of acceptance of available vaccines, vaccine boosters and therapeutics; the speed at which available vaccines, including boosters and updated versions of vaccines, and therapeutics can be successfully deployed; ongoing clinical experience, which may differ considerably across regions and fluctuate over time; the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the macroeconomic environment and global financial markets, including the rate of inflation, interest rates and labor market; and on other future developments, including the ultimate duration, spread and intensity of new outbreaks, the extent to which governments impose, rollback or re-impose preventative restrictions and the availability of ongoing government financial support to our business, tenants, managers and borrowers.\nThere is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and other pandemic-related legislation and any future COVID-19 relief measures. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial assistance we or our tenants or borrowers will receive or that we will be able to benefit from provisions intended to increase access to resources and ease regulatory burdens for healthcare providers.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 authorized a total of $186 billion to be distributed to healthcare providers through the Provider Relief Fund, which is administered by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (\u201cHHS\u201d). These grants are intended to reimburse eligible providers for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Recipients are not required to repay distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including reporting, record maintenance and audit requirements and not use grants received from the Provider Relief Fund to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse.\nHHS began distributing Provider Relief Fund grants in April 2020 and has made grants available to various provider groups in phases. We applied for grants under Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 of the Provider Relief Fund on behalf of the assisted living communities in our senior living operations segment and may apply for additional grants in the future. While we have received grants from the Provider Relief Fund in the past, there can be no assurance that we will receive additional grants from the Provider Relief Fund or any future source of government funding in the future. Any grants that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our senior living operating portfolio that are attributable to COVID-19. Further, although we continue to monitor and evaluate the terms and conditions associated with the Provider Relief Fund distributions, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all requirements related to the payments received under the Provider Relief Fund. If we or any of our tenants fail to comply with all of the terms and conditions, we or they may be required to repay some or all of the grants received and may be subject to other enforcement action, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThere remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the continued implementation of the CARES Act and related legislation. The federal government continues to evaluate its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether additional financial measures and related regulations and guidance should be implemented. There can be no assurance that the terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Fund grants or other programs will not change or be interpreted in ways that affect our ability to comply with such terms and conditions (which could affect our ability to retain any grants that we receive), the amount of total financial grants we may ultimately receive or our eligibility to participate in any future funding. We continue to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses to the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy\nMacroeconomic trends including rising labor costs and historically low unemployment, increases in inflation and rising interest rates may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nMacroeconomic trends, including rising labor costs and historically low unemployment, increases in inflation and rising interest rates, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increased labor costs and shortage of available skilled and unskilled workers may increase the cost of staffing our or our tenants\u2019, managers\u2019 or borrowers\u2019 workforce, including employees at our senior housing communities. To the extent we or our tenants, managers or borrowers cannot hire sufficient workers, we or they may become dependent on high-cost alternatives to meet labor needs, including contract and overtime labor. If we are unable to hire and fill necessary positions, our business may suffer or operate below capacity, causing us to forego potential revenue and growth or affecting our ability to effectively manage risk. Rising labor expense may result in decreased operating net income.\nWe and our tenants, managers and borrowers compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel who are responsible for our day-to-day operations. Competitive pressures, including historically low unemployment, may require that we or our tenants, managers and borrowers enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel or use more costly contract or overtime labor. We may not be able to offset such additional costs by increasing the rates we charge residents and tenants. If there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nMany of our costs, including operating and administrative expenses, interest expense and real estate acquisition and construction costs are subject to inflation. These include expenses for property-related contracted services, utilities, repairs and maintenance and insurance and general and administrative costs including compensation costs, technology services and professional service fees. See also \u201c-We may face increased risks and costs associated with volatility in materials and labor prices or as a result of supply chain or procurement disruptions, which may adversely affect the status of our construction projects.,\u201d below. Property taxes are also impacted by inflationary changes because taxes in some jurisdictions are regularly reassessed based on changes in the fair value of our properties. We may not be able to offset such additional costs by passing them through, or increasing the rates we charge, to residents and tenants. If there is an increase in these costs, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nMacroeconomic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results.\nWe are exposed to general economic conditions, local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties. Our operating performance is impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties and could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any such markets.\nA substantial portion of our value is derived from properties in California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois, and as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, changing demographics, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. The loss of any one of our key personnel or the inability to maintain appropriate staffing could adversely impact our business.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and the ability to maintain appropriate staffing levels across our organization. Failure to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in loss of institutional knowledge or important skills sets or an ineffective culture, significantly impacting our performance and adversely affecting our business.\nThe historically low unemployment and tight labor market may make it difficult for us to hire skilled and unskilled employees to meet our staffing needs. Competition for talented employees is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences could negatively affect the health, availability and productivity of our current personnel and have impacted our ability to recruit and attract new employees and retain current employees, particularly as remote and hybrid work arrangements and their impact on the market for talent remains uncertain. If our long-term compensation and retention plans and succession plans are not effective, if we lose any one or more of our key officers and employees or are unable to maintain appropriate staffing or operate below capacity - causing us to forego potential revenue and growth opportunities and affecting our ability to effectively manage risk - our business could be adversely affected.\nOur third-party managers and tenants operate or exert substantial control over the properties that they manage for or rent from us, which limits our control and influence over operations and results.\nA significant portion of our properties are either managed for us by third-party managers or leased from us by third-party tenants. Our third-party managers and tenants are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the properties that they manage for or lease from us. We have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of those properties, even though we have approval rights with respect to certain matters and the right to review operational and financial reporting information with respect to a majority of our portfolio. We depend on third parties to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law and regulation, minimizes legal risk and maximizes the value of our investment. The failure by\nthese third parties to operate these properties efficiently and effectively and adequately manage the related risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating assets may expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of the properties in our senior housing operating portfolio. However, as the owner and manager of senior housing properties we are ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of such properties, other than those arising out of certain actions by our managers, such as gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. These risks include, and our resulting revenues are impacted by, among other things, fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to charge desirable resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of labor shortages, unionization, inflation or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, changes in management or equity, accounting misstatements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of insurance. Any one or a combination of these factors could result in deficiencies in our senior living operations segment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such operational risks could also arise as a result of our ownership of office buildings, and which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally hold the applicable healthcare license and enroll in applicable government healthcare programs on behalf of the properties in our senior living operations segment. This subjects us to potential liability under various healthcare laws and regulations. Healthcare laws and regulations are wide-ranging, and noncompliance may result in the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including: the loss or suspension of accreditation, licenses or certificates of need; suspension of or non-payment for new admissions; denial of reimbursement; fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal, state and foreign healthcare programs or community closure.\nA significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of tenants and managers, including Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent, Kindred, Atria and Sunrise.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Atria and Sunrise, collectively, managed 256 of our consolidated senior housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. As of December 31, 2021, Atria managed 162 communities and Holiday Retirement managed 91 communities under their own distinct management contracts with us. Ventas has the ongoing right to terminate the management contract for 91 of the Holiday-managed communities with short term notice. As a result of Atria\u2019s acquisition of the Holiday Management platform and our acquisition of New Senior Investment Group Inc. in 2021, taken together, the Atria/Holiday Retirement concentration represents 253 communities. As of December 31, 2021, our three largest tenants, Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred leased from us 121 properties, 12 properties and 31 properties, respectively. These properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and NOI.\nWe depend on Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred, to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures, and to comply with the terms of the mortgage financing, if any, affecting the properties they lease from us. These tenants have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. We cannot assure you that they will be able to satisfy their obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by any one of Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent or Kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve the properties they lease from us could adversely affect their financial condition and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on Atria and Sunrise to manage a significant portion of the properties in our senior living operations segment, including by setting appropriate resident fees, managing expenses, providing accurate property-level financial results in a timely manner and otherwise operate our senior housing communities profitably and in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable law and regulation. Any adverse developments in such managers\u2019 business and affairs or financial condition could impair their ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could adversely affect the financial performance of our properties and our business, financial condition and results of operations. If either Atria or Sunrise experience financial, legal, accounting, regulatory or other difficulties that impact their financial stability, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our tenants\u2019, managers\u2019 or borrowers\u2019 financial condition or business prospects deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on our tenants, managers and borrowers and their ability to perform their obligations to us, regardless of whether our relationship is structured as a triple-net lease, a management contract or as a loan. Any of our tenants, managers or borrowers may experience a downturn in their business that materially weakens their financial condition. If their financial condition deteriorates, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations to us in a timely manner if at all. Although we generally have the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict a tenant, terminate our management agreements, demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or pursue other remedies, we may not be able to enforce these rights or we may determine it is not prudent to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.\nOur senior housing tenants, managers and borrowers primarily depend on private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members to pay fees. Costs associated with independent and assisted living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Accordingly, the tenants, managers and borrowers of our senior housing operating portfolio depend on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets, which may be affected by many factors, including: (i) prevailing economic and market trends, including market volatility and inflation; (ii) consumer confidence; (iii) demographics; (iv) property condition and safety, including as a result of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness, such as that seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; (v) public perception about such properties; and (vi) social and environmental factors. If our tenants, managers or borrowers fail to effectively conduct their operations, or to maintain and improve our properties on our behalf, it could adversely affect our business reputation as the owner of the properties, as well as the business reputation of our tenants, managers or borrowers and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our and our tenants\u2019, managers\u2019 or borrowers\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if widespread default or nonpayment of outstanding obligations from a large number of tenants, managers or borrowers occurs at a time when terminating our agreements with, or replacing such tenants, managers or borrowers may be extremely difficult or impossible, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may elect instead to amend such agreements with such tenants, managers or borrowers. However, such amendments may be on terms that are less favorable to us than the original agreements and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur senior housing tenants, managers and borrowers may rely on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of the revenues from certain properties. Changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation, that may result from actions by the U.S. Congress or U.S. executive orders, may result in reductions in our tenants\u2019, managers\u2019 or borrowers\u2019 revenues, operations and cash flows and affect our tenants\u2019, managers\u2019 or borrowers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us. Failure to comply with reimbursement regulations or other laws applicable to healthcare providers could result in penalties, fines, litigation costs, lost revenue or other consequences, which could adversely impact our tenants\u2019 ability to make contractual rent payments to us under a triple-net lease or our cash flows from operations under a management arrangement.\nOur tenants, managers and borrowers have, and may continue to seek to, offset losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic by obtaining funds under the CARES Act or other similar legislative initiatives at the state and local level. We cannot determine when or if these government funds will ultimately be received by our tenants, managers and borrowers or whether these funds may materially offset the cash flow disruptions experienced by them. If they are unable to obtain these funds within a reasonable time period or at all, or the conditions precedent to receiving these funds are overly burdensome or not feasible, it may substantially affect their ability to make payments or perform their obligations when due to us.\nWe face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers, borrowers and other obligors.\nWe lease a significant number of our properties to unaffiliated tenants, operate a significant number of our properties through third-party managers and provide financing to third-party borrowers. We have limited control over the success or failure of our tenants\u2019, managers\u2019 and borrowers\u2019 businesses, and, at any time, a tenant, borrower or manager may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition. If that happens, the tenant, borrower or manager may fail to make payments or meet its other obligations to us. See \u201c-If a borrower defaults, we may be unable to obtain payment, successfully foreclose on collateral or realize the value of any collateral, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment,\u201d below.\nA downturn in any one of our tenants\u2019, borrowers\u2019 or managers\u2019 businesses could ultimately lead to its bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes, which may be largely outside of its control. Bankruptcy and insolvency laws\nafford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our rights and remedies unenforceable or delay our ability to pursue such rights and remedies and realize any recoveries. For example, we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy filing. A debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. We also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (such as real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant or manager.\nBankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may result in increased costs and require significant management attention and resources. If we are unable to transition affected properties efficiently and effectively, such properties could experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. Publicity about a tenant\u2019s, borrower\u2019s or manager\u2019s financial condition and insolvency proceedings may negatively impact its reputation, which could result in decreased customer demand and revenues. Any or all of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single third party, as a failure or default would expose us to these risks across multiple properties.\nIf we need to replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, if at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur tenants may not renew their leases with us, and our managers may not renew their management agreements with us, beyond their current terms. For example, our lease of six LTACs to Kindred is set to expire in 2023, though Kindred has the right to extend the term of the lease for an additional 5 years. Even if a tenant renews its lease with us, or a manager renews its management agreement with us, we cannot assure you that the renewals will be on favorable terms. Our leases and management agreements provide us, our tenants and our managers with termination rights in certain circumstances. If our leases or management agreements are not renewed or are otherwise terminated, we may attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or manager, as applicable. We may not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases, management agreements or other arrangements with new tenants or managers on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases or management agreements, if at all. We may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (such as real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned.\nIf our leases are not renewed or are otherwise terminated at some properties, we may attempt to sell those properties. We may not be successful in identifying suitable buyers or entering into sale agreements with buyers on a timely basis or on favorable terms, if at all, and we may be required to fund some expenses and obligations (such as real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being sold.\nDuring transition periods to new tenants or managers, the attention of existing tenants or managers may be diverted from the performance of the properties, which could cause the financial and operational performance at those properties to decline. Our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or manager could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, certificates of need, Medicaid change-of-ownership rules or other legal and regulatory requirements or restrictions. We could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings.\nIn the case of our leased properties, following expiration of a lease term, or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we attempt to reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant. This risk could be exacerbated by laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions that limit our ability to take remedial action against defaulted tenants under certain circumstances. Market conditions in effect at the time of the expiration or default of a lease may require us to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain tenants or obtain new suitable replacement tenants. Our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants could be impaired by the specialized healthcare use or contractual restrictions on use of the property, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses.\nIf a borrower defaults, we may be unable to obtain payment, successfully foreclose on collateral or realize the value of any collateral, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment.\nIf a borrower defaults under a mortgage or other loan for which we are the lender, we may attempt to obtain payment in full or foreclose on the collateral securing the loan, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. The defaulting borrower may not be able to repay us even if we are legally entitled to full repayment of the debt. The defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available\nremedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies or bring claims against us for lender liability. Any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c-We face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers, borrowers and other obligors,\u201d above.\nAlthough our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may decide not to exercise those remedies for one or more reasons. For example, we may not exercise remedies (or be successful in exercising remedies) if the terms are not enforceable, if the terms are too costly to enforce or if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches. We may also decide not to enforce other contractual protections, such as annual rent escalators, or the properties may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters. Any of the risks described above could be exacerbated by new laws and regulations enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise that limit our ability to enforce or terminate a lease, evict a tenant or pursue other remedies against tenants.\nEven if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgages and other loans, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our investment and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. The collateral may include equity interests in an entity with unexpected liabilities that limits the value of those equity interests or with other limiting characteristics that may result in us not having full recourse to assets within that entity\u2019s subsidiary structure. For example, our mezzanine loan investments are subordinate to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate and, in certain circumstances, affords them the ability to extinguish our rights in the collateral. Any equity interests included in acquired capital may be subject to securities law restrictions that limit our ability to sell those interests in a timely manner. We may be unable to reposition any real property included in acquired collateral on a timely basis, if at all, or without making significant improvements or repairs. Any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover the full amount of our investment.\nWe are vulnerable to adverse changes affecting our specific asset classes and the real estate industry generally.\nWe invest in a variety of assets classes in healthcare real estate, including senior housing, medical office, life science, research and innovation, hospitals, long-term acute care facilities and other healthcare properties. While we endeavor to invest in a diversified portfolio, there can be no assurance that in a particular economic or operational environment all assets will perform equally well or that our balance sheet will be appropriately balanced. Each of our asset classes are subject to their own dynamics and their own specific operational, financial, compliance, regulatory and market risks.\nA broad downturn or slowdown in the healthcare real estate sector could have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries and could negatively impact the ability of our tenants, managers and borrowers to meet their obligations to us. A downturn or slowdown in any one of our asset classes could adversely affect the value of our properties in such asset class and our ability to sell such properties at prices or on terms acceptable or favorable to us if at all.\nWe are exposed to the risks inherent in investments in real estate. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. If we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry. Transfers of healthcare real estate may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial real estate. We cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that we or our tenants, managers and borrowers are unable to navigate successfully the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries in which we or they operate, we may be adversely affected.\nOur tenants, managers and borrowers include senior housing managers, hospitals, post-acute facilities and other healthcare systems, medical offices and life sciences and technology companies that are subject to a complex set of trends affecting their businesses and the industries in which they operate. If we or they are unable to successfully navigate these trends, our business, financial condition and results and that of our tenants, managers and borrowers could be adversely affected.\nThere have been, and there are expected to continue to be, advances and changes in technology, payment models, healthcare delivery models, regulation and consumer behavior and perception that could reduce demand for on-site activities provided at our properties. For example, the increased demand in telehealth solutions could broadly impact market demand for our properties and cause long-term structural changes in the marketplace. If our tenants and managers are unable to adapt to long-term changes in demand, their financial condition could be materially impacted and our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nOur tenants, managers and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market, which has been compounded by general inflationary pressures on wages and the COVID-19 pandemic and could be further compounded by a shortage of care givers or other trained personnel, union activities or minimum wage laws. These pressures may require our tenants, managers and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for trained personnel or use high-cost alternatives to meet labor needs, including contract and overtime labor. They may be unable to offset these increased costs by increasing the amounts they charge their patients, residents or clients. Rising labor expense could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants, managers and borrowers and impair their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as \u201cutilization reviews,\u201d have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our tenants, specifically acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement and the availability of home healthcare options. Several of these laws, including the Affordable Care Act, have promoted shifting from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models to alternative payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and cost of care, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments. See \u201cGovernment Regulation - United States Healthcare Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. These and other trends could significantly and adversely affect the profitability of these tenants, which could affect their ability to make payments or meet their other obligations to us or their willingness to renew their leases on terms that are as favorable to us, or at all.\nThe hospitals on or near the campuses where our MOBs are located and their affiliated health systems may not remain competitive or financially viable.\nOur MOBs and other properties that serve the healthcare industry depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near the campuses where our properties are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our properties. The viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on a solid quality and mix of healthcare services provided, successful competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, positive demographic trends in the surrounding community, superior market position and growth potential as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. If a hospital on or near the campus where one of our properties is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, that hospital may be unable to compete successfully. That could adversely impact the hospital\u2019s ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients, and, in some cases, the hospital might even close or relocate. We rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our MOB and similar properties. If a hospital moves, closes, doesn\u2019t remain competitive or financially viable or can\u2019t attract physicians and physician groups, our properties and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur life science, research and innovation tenants face unique levels of expense and uncertainty.\nOur life science, research and innovation tenants develop and sell products and services in an industry that is characterized by rapid and significant changes, evolving industry standards, significant research and development risk and uncertainty over the implementation of new healthcare reform legislation. These tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical or other life science products, require significant outlays of funds for the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and commercialization of their products and technologies, as well as to fund their other obligations, including rent payments to us. Our tenants\u2019 ability to raise capital depends on the timely success of their research and development activities, viability of their products and technologies, their financial and operating condition and outlook and the overall financial, banking and economic environment. If private investors, the federal government, universities, public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support these tenants because of general economic conditions, adverse market conditions or otherwise, a tenant may not be able to pay rent or meet its other obligations to us and its business may fail. The financing market for life science and R&I companies has been and may continue to be volatile, which may contribute to these risks.\nThe research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants\u2019 products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. The approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. Even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. If one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly and adversely affect the tenant\u2019s entire business. Our tenants may be unable to manufacture their products successfully or economically, may be unable to adapt to rapid technological advances in their industry, may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property, may face competition from new products or may not receive acceptance of their products. If our life science, research and innovation tenants\u2019 business deteriorates for these or any other reasons, they may be unable to make payments or meet their other obligations to us.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our life science, research and innovation tenants will be successful in their businesses. Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above may have difficulty making payments or satisfying its other obligations to us, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased construction and development in the markets in which our properties are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability.\nIf existing supply and development collectively outpaces demand in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Depending on the jurisdiction, there are limited barriers to developing properties in our asset classes, particularly senior housing. As a result, supply and demand dynamics can change quickly. We may be unable to rebalance our portfolio in a timely manner in order to respond to changes in those dynamics.\nMerger, acquisition and investment activity in our industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor\u2019s investment in, one or more of our tenants, managers or borrowers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe senior housing and healthcare industries have experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, including among owners of real estate, tenants, managers, borrowers and care providers. When a change of control of a tenant, manager or borrower occurs, that tenant\u2019s, manager\u2019s or borrower\u2019s strategy, financial condition, management team or real estate needs may change, any of which could adversely affect our relationship with that party and our revenues and results of operations. If any of our tenants or managers merge with one another, our dependence on a small group of significant third parties would increase, as would our exposure to the risks described above under \u201c-Our investments in and acquisitions of properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.\u201d A competitor\u2019s investment in one of our tenants, managers or borrowers could enable our competitor to directly or indirectly influence that tenant\u2019s, manager\u2019s or borrower\u2019s business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, manager or borrower or is otherwise adverse to our interests. Depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may not have the right to prevent a competitor\u2019s investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, manager or borrower.\nOur ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon identifying and consummating future acquisitions and investments and effectively managing our expansion opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio, directly or indirectly with third parties, through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activities in domestic and international healthcare real estate. Our ability to execute this strategy successfully is affected by many factors, including the significant competition we face for acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities, our relationships with current and prospective clients and partners, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with counterparties, including buyers and sellers of assets. We compete for these opportunities with a broad variety of potential investors, including other healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have advantages compared to us, including greater financial resources and lower costs of capital. See \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. If we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities and otherwise expanding and diversifying our portfolio, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected.\nWhen expanding into areas that are new to us, we face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk; (iii) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other businesses; (iv) the increasing demands on or issues related to operational and management systems and controls; (v) compliance with additional legal or regulatory requirements with which we are not familiar; and (vi) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Any new strategies, markets or businesses that we enter into may not be successful or meet our expectations, or we may be unable to effectively monitor or manage our portfolio of properties as it expands. Failure to meet any of these objectives could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in and acquisitions of properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. Investing in and acquiring healthcare real estate entails risks associated with real estate investments generally, including the risk that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that a tenant, manager or borrower will fail to meet performance expectations or their obligations to us. We make acquisitions and investments outside the United States, which raises legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations and foreign tax risks.\nOur real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including the risk of construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. Healthcare real estate properties are often highly customized, and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific or market-driven improvements.\nOther risks that our significant acquisition and investment activity, including our developments and redevelopments, presents include that:\n\u2022We may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, retain key personnel or companies we acquire or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame if at all;\n\u2022Our underwriting assumptions, including projections of estimated future revenues and expenses and anticipated synergies and other costs savings, and other financial and operating metrics that we develop may be inaccurate, in which case we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, investment, development or redevelopment;\n\u2022Our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022Acquisitions and investments could divert management\u2019s attention from our existing assets;\n\u2022The value of the assets we acquire or invest in may decline or we may not realize the expected return on the developments or redevelopments we undertake; and\n\u2022If our acquisitions, investments, developments and redevelopments are not successful, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nSee also \u201c-Our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon identifying and consummating future acquisitions and investments and effectively managing our expansion opportunities,\u201d below.\nWe cannot assure you that our acquisitions, investments, developments and redevelopments will be successful or meet our expectations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in co-investment vehicles, joint ventures and minority interests may subject us to risks and liabilities that we would not otherwise face.\nWe have and may continue to develop and acquire properties in co-investment vehicles or joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. In 2020 we formed Ventas Investment Management (\u201cVIM\u201d) to consolidate our private capital management capabilities for certain assets. As of December 31, 2021, VIM had over $4.5 billion in assets under management, including the Ventas Life Science and Healthcare Real Estate Fund, L.P. (the \u201cVentas Fund\u201d), our joint venture with GIC and certain other institutional private capital vehicles. This includes gross asset value, unfunded equity commitments, and total project costs for development projects under way. We also own minority investments in properties and unconsolidated operating entities. These minority investments usually entitle us to typical rights and protections but inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations than if we owned a majority interest. In the future, we may enter into additional co-investments, partnerships and joint ventures, either through VIM or otherwise.\nThere can be no assurance that our co-investments, joint ventures or minority investments will be successful or meet our expectations. These investments and ventures involve significant risk, including the following:\n\u2022We may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority;\n\u2022For ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our partners may take actions that we oppose;\n\u2022If our partners become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fulfill other partner obligations, we may choose to or be required to contribute that capital;\n\u2022Some of our joint ventures are subject to debt and, depending on credit market conditions, the refinancing or payoff of such debt may require equity capital calls, which we or our partner may not be capable of funding or may otherwise be required at inopportune times;\n\u2022We may be subject to restrictions on our ability to transfer our interest in the investment or venture, which may require us to retain our interest at a time when we would otherwise prefer to sell it;\n\u2022Our partners may have business interests or goals that conflict with our business interests and goals, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments, and what levels of financing to incur or carry;\n\u2022Our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest, including with respect to our compliance with the REIT requirements, and our REIT status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with REIT requirements;\n\u2022Our joint ventures or our joint venture partners may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them;\n\u2022Our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest;\n\u2022We could experience an impasse on certain decisions where we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes;\n\u2022We could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that could lead to the sale of either parties\u2019 ownership interest or the property;\n\u2022Disagreements with our partners could result in litigation or arbitration; and\n\u2022We may suffer other losses as a result of actions taken by our partners with respect to our venture investments.\nIn some instances, our partners may have the right to cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner\u2019s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner\u2019s interest will be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. This may require us to sell our interest in the investment or venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it.\nIn certain circumstances, Ventas serves as managing member, general partner or controlling party with respect to its co-investments and joint ventures, including the Ventas Fund and our joint venture with GIC. In such instances, we may face additional risks including the following:\n\u2022Ventas may have increased duties to the other investors or partners in the co-investment or joint venture;\n\u2022In the event of certain events or conflicts, our partners may have recourse against Ventas, including the right to monetary penalties, the ability to force a sale or exit the venture;\n\u2022Our partners may have the right to remove us as the general partner or managing member in certain cases involving cause; and\n\u2022Our subsidiaries that would be the general partner or managing member of the joint ventures could be generally liable, under applicable law or the governing agreement of a venture, for the debts and obligations of the venture, subject to certain exculpation and indemnification rights pursuant to the terms of the governing agreement.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition or result of operations.\nOur positive reputation for quality and service with our stakeholders, including our tenants, managers, development partners, lenders and stockholders, could be damaged if we experience a sustained period of distress, where our properties\nunderperform, our tenants or managers default or in other instances that result in misalignment with those parties. Damage to our reputation could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult to continue to grow and expand our relationships with our tenants, managers, development partners and lenders, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopment, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability.\nWe invest in various development and redevelopment projects. In deciding whether to make an investment in a project, we make certain underwriting assumptions regarding expected future performance. Our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that:\n\u2022Tenants may not lease the amount of space projected or at the projected rental rate levels or lease on the projected schedule, including due to increased competition in the market and other market and economic conditions;\n\u2022Our underwriting assumptions and other financial and operating metrics that we develop, such as the estimated costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property, may be inaccurate, in which case we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the project;\n\u2022We may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts;\n\u2022We may not be able to recognize rental revenue even though cash rent is being paid and the lease has commenced;\n\u2022We may encounter delays in obtaining or we may fail to obtain necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations;\n\u2022We may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all, including at the maturity of an applicable construction loan;\n\u2022Construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs, including through rent abatement;\n\u2022Volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs;\n\u2022Any partners in the project may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the project, which lessens our control and could lead to increased costs, project delays or disputes;\n\u2022Our builders or development managers may fail to meet their obligations to us or satisfy the expectations of our tenants and partners; and\n\u2022We may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions or addressing markets that are new to us, including new markets where we may not have sufficient depth of market knowledge.\nWe may face increased risks and costs associated with volatility in materials and labor prices or as a result of supply chain or procurement disruptions, which may adversely affect the status of our construction projects.\nThe price of commodities and skilled labor for our construction projects may increase due to external factors, including, but not limited to, performance of third-party suppliers and contractors; overall market supply and demand; government regulation and changes in general business, economic or political conditions. As a result, the costs of construction materials and skilled labor required for the completion of our development and redevelopment projects may fluctuate significantly over time.\nWe rely on a number of third-party suppliers and contractors to supply materials and skilled labor for our construction projects. We may experience difficulties obtaining necessary materials from suppliers or vendors whose supply chains might be disrupted by macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, or difficulties obtaining adequate skilled labor from third-party contractors in a tightening labor market. If we are unable to access materials and labor to complete our construction projects within our expected budgets and meet our tenants\u2019 demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner, our results of operations may be adversely impacted. We may be unable to complete our development or redevelopment projects timely or within our budget, which may affect our ability to lease space to potential tenants and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences have contributed to global supply chain disruptions including the supply of some construction materials. These disruptions could cause construction delays or significantly affect the cost of our development or redevelopment projects through higher costs for construction materials, labor and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Significant construction delays and increases in costs because of the supply chain disruptions could interfere with our ability to meet commitments to our counterparties and could have a material impact on our business.\nIf any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own properties that are subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated.\nOur investments in medical office, life science and research and innovation buildings and facilities as well as other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. Many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties\u2019 value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. We could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us, are terminated or expire.\nDamage from catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural events and the physical effects of climate change could result in losses to the Company.\nSome of our properties are in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural events, including fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding and other severe weather. These adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties that could exceed our or our tenants\u2019, borrowers\u2019 or managers\u2019 property insurance coverage. Any of these events could cause a major power outage, leading to a disruption of our systems and operations. If we incur a loss greater than insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable.\nIf significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Where climate change has a significant or sustained impact, our properties could be destroyed and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in federal, state or foreign legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.\nOur Capital Structure Risks\nMarket conditions and the actual and perceived state of the capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the capital markets and any disruption to the capital markets or our ability to access such markets could impair our ability to fulfill our dividend requirements, make payments to our security holders or otherwise finance our business operations. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world, including rising inflation, a general tightening of availability of credit (including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained), the state of the public and private capital markets, decreased liquidity in certain financial markets, increased interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, declining consumer confidence, the actual or perceived state of the real estate market, tightened labor markets or significant declines in stock markets, as well as concerns regarding pandemics, epidemics and the spread of contagious diseases, could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, including recessions, economic slowdowns, high unemployment and rising prices or the perception by consumers of weak or weakening economic conditions may reduce disposable income and impact consumer spending in healthcare or senior housing, for example, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nDuring inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense of our borrowings. We are exposed to increases in interest rates in the short term through our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, our unsecured term loans and our commercial paper program. Therefore, interest rate increases, due to inflation or otherwise, could in the short term, increase our interest expense under these\nvariable-rate facilities and in the long term, increase our financing costs as we refinance our existing variable-rate and fixed-rate long-term borrowings, or incur additional interest expense related to the issuance of incremental debt.\nTo the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties\u037e (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may be able to obtain\u037e (iii) our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance when due, any outstanding indebtedness\u037e (iv) our ability to pay a dividend and (v) the ability of our tenants to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nWe are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective.\nInterest rates are rising and are expected to continue rising. Increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and a decrease in the market price of our common stock. Increases in interest rates may also adversely affect the securities markets generally, which could reduce the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. Any such unfavorable changes to our borrowing costs and price of our common stock could significantly impact our ability to raise new debt and equity capital going forward and increase the cost of financing on our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. An increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), Bankers\u2019 Acceptance or other indexes. The generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates continue to rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. These increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity.\nWe may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. Moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $12.1 billion of outstanding principal indebtedness. The instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. Our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. A high level of indebtedness on an absolute basis or as a ratio to our cash flow could also have the following consequences:\n\u2022Potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries;\n\u2022Potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and\n\u2022Potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nWe mortgage, and expect to continue to mortgage, certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. If we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value.\nWe are highly dependent on access to the capital markets. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on us, including our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs. We cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate, that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained or that interest rates will not rise, any of which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us.\nAs a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market\u2019s perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. Our failure to meet the market\u2019s expectation regarding future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences have caused, and could continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide, including widespread inflation that could lead to a rise in interest rates. It is possible that conditions in the bank lending, capital and other financial markets could again deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, and that could in turn mean that our access to capital and other sources of funding could become constrained. Any of these conditions could adversely affect the availability and terms of our future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. The continuance of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences on our business could lead to downgrades of our long-term credit rating. See \u201cRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic-The COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,\u201d above. Any future downgrades could increase our borrowing costs, which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.\nWe rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur ownership of properties in Canada and the United Kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars or the British pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. If we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, senior housing or healthcare assets outside the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. Although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such hedging will be successful and that fluctuations will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe phasing out of LIBOR may affect our financial results.\nLIBOR and certain other interest \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are subject to regulatory guidance and reform that have caused and may in the future cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. Following announcements by the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, and ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, which administers LIBOR publication, publication of most LIBOR settings ceased after December 31, 2021. While publication of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings is expected to\ncease after June 30, 2023, U.S., European Union and U.K. regulators have discouraged use of LIBOR for any new contracts entered into after year-end 2021. We have already transitioned certain foreign LIBOR rates used in our Line of Credit that were discontinued at year-end 2021. While there are other rates that have gained market acceptance as alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected SOFR as the recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish the SOFR in April 2018. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets and could have an adverse effect on LIBOR-based interest rates on our current or future debt obligations. Specifically, significant portions of the market for new LIBOR-based transactions could experience materially reduced liquidity or pricing transparency. There can be no assurance that any agreement we reach to replace LIBOR in any contract will result in effective interest rates at least as favorable to us as our current effective interest rates. The failure to reach an agreement on a replacement benchmark, or the failure to reach an agreement that results in an effective interest rate at least as favorable to us as our current effective interest rates, could result in an increase in our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCovenants in the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could adversely affect our operations.\nThe terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. Our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. Covenants contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries\u2019 outstanding mortgage indebtedness may restrict our ability to obtain cash distributions from such subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations. Financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants or managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we or our tenants or managers may be subject to lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and managers. These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims and employment claims, as well as regulatory proceedings, including proceedings related to our senior living operations, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license.\nIn our operating assets, including those in our senior living operations and office segments, we are generally responsible for all liabilities of the properties, including any lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal or regulatory proceedings, other than those arising out of certain actions by our managers, such as those caused by gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. As a result, we have exposure to, among other things, professional and general liability claims, employment law claims and the associated litigation and other costs related to defending and resolving such claims. In our senior living operations in particular, if one of our managers fails to comply with applicable law or regulation, we may be held responsible, which could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including the loss or suspension of accreditation, licenses or certificates of need; suspension of or nonpayment for new admissions; denial of reimbursement; fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs; or facility closure.\nIn some circumstances, our tenants or managers may be contractually obligated to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless in whole or in part with respect to certain actions, legal or regulatory proceedings. In addition, third parties from whom we acquired certain of our assets and, in some cases, their affiliates may be required by the terms of the related conveyance documents to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless against certain actions, investigations and claims related to the acquired assets and arising prior to our ownership or related to excluded assets and liabilities. In some cases, a portion of the purchase price consideration is held in escrow for a specified period of time as collateral for these indemnification obligations. We cannot assure you that these third parties will be able to satisfy their defense and indemnification obligations to\nus or that any purchase price consideration held in escrow will be sufficient to satisfy claims for which we are entitled to indemnification.\nAn unfavorable resolution of any such lawsuit, investigation, claims or other legal or regulatory proceeding could materially and adversely affect our or our tenants\u2019 or managers\u2019 liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and may not be protected by sufficient insurance coverage. Even with a favorable resolution of litigation or a proceeding, the effect of litigation and other potential litigation and proceedings may materially increase operating costs we or our tenants or managers incur. Negative publicity with respect to any lawsuits, claims or other legal or regulatory proceedings may also negatively impact their or our or the properties\u2019 reputation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may in the future cause our senior housing and healthcare business to face increased exposure to lawsuits or other legal or regulatory proceedings filed at the same time across multiple jurisdictions, such as professional or general liability litigation alleging wrongful death and negligence claims, some of which may result in large damage awards and not be indemnified or subject to sufficient insurance coverage, may require our support as a result of our indemnification agreements or may result in restrictions in the operations of our or our tenants\u2019 or managers\u2019 business.\nWe and our tenants, managers and borrowers may be adversely affected by regulation and enforcement.\nWe and our tenants, managers and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry is subject to laws and regulations that relate to, among other things, licensure and certificates of need, conduct of operations, ownership of communities and facilities, construction of new communities and facilities and addition of equipment, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, appropriateness and classification of care, patient rights, resident health and safety, data privacy and security laws, wage and hour laws, fraud and abuse and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. We generally hold the applicable healthcare licenses and enroll in applicable government healthcare programs on behalf of the properties in our senior living operations segment, and that subjects us to potential liability under some healthcare laws and regulations. See \u201cGovernment Regulation-United States Healthcare Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. Many of our life science, research and innovation tenants are subject to laws and regulations that govern the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of drugs, medical devices and similar products.\nThe laws and regulations that apply to us and our tenants, managers and borrowers are complex and may change rapidly, and efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources. Any changes in scope, interpretation or enforcement of the regulatory framework could require us or our tenants, managers or borrowers to invest significant resources responding to these changes. If we or our tenants, managers or borrowers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to our or their businesses and the operation of our or their properties, we or they could face a number of remedial actions, including forced closure, loss of accreditation, bans on admissions of new patients or residents, imposition of fines, ineligibility to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs or civil or criminal penalties. If any of these occur, our and our tenants\u2019, managers\u2019 and borrowers\u2019 businesses, results of operations (including results of properties) or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur investments may expose us to unknown liabilities.\nWe may acquire or invest in properties or businesses that are subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may assume or incur liabilities, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities, and be exposed to actual or potential claims in connection with our acquisitions that adversely affect us, such as:\n\u2022Liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions;\n\u2022Unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers;\n\u2022Liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition;\n\u2022Claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and\n\u2022Liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.\nIf the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or damage our business relationships and reputation.\nCybersecurity incidents and cyber-attacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level and will likely continue to increase in frequency in the future. As our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers\u2019 or venture partners\u2019 systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. While we, our managers and our business partners have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, these measures cannot guarantee that we or they will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. Our information technology networks and related systems are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business, and a cyber incident could result in a data center outage, disrupting our systems and operations or the operations of our managers or business partners, compromise the confidential information of our employees, partners or the residents in our senior housing communities, and damage our business relationships and reputation. Although we have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, these measures and the systems supporting them could prove to be inadequate and, if compromised, could become inoperable for extended periods of time, cease to function properly or fail to adequately secure private information. We do not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-party providers, and third-party providers may have limited indemnification obligations to us, which could cause us to be negatively impacted as a result. Breaches, such as those involving covertly introduced malware, impersonation of authorized users and industrial or other espionage, may not be identified even with sophisticated prevention and detection systems, potentially resulting in further harm and preventing them from being addressed appropriately. The failure of these systems or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information, material nonpublic information and intellectual property and trade secrets and other sensitive information we possess. We could be required to make a significant investment to remedy the effects of any failures, including but not limited to harm to our reputation, legal claims that we and our partners may be subjected to, regulatory or enforcement action arising out of applicable privacy and other laws, adverse publicity, or other events that may affect our business and financial performance.\nThe amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, managers or other counterparties may not adequately insure against losses.\nWe maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, managers or other counterparties maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in each industry. Although we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, managers or other counterparties will be able to procure or maintain adequate levels of insurance. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost of insurance has increased and may further increase, and, due to changes in coverage terms resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, insurance may not cover some claims related to COVID-19. We also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, managers or other counterparties will maintain the insurance coverage required under our lease, management and other agreements, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that this insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or at all or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties when a catastrophic event occurs. We cannot make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, managers and other counterparties. If we sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to pay the difference and we could lose our investment in, or experience reduced profits and cash flows from, our operations.\nIn some cases, we and our tenants and managers may be subject to professional liability, general liability, employment, premise, privacy, environmental, unfair business practice and contracts claims brought by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys seeking significant damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, some of which may not be insured or indemnified and some of which may result in significant damage awards. Due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against senior housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased, and the premiums on this insurance coverage remain costly. Insurance for other claims such as wage and hour, certain environmental, privacy and unfair business practices may no longer be available, and the premiums on that insurance coverage, to the extent it is available, remain\ncostly. As a result, insurance protection against these claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants or managers and may not be available at a reasonable cost or otherwise on terms that provide adequate coverage. If we or our tenants and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities, and the adverse impact on our or our tenants\u2019 and managers\u2019 respective financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material, and could adversely affect our tenants\u2019 and managers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us.\nAdditionally, we and those of our tenants and managers who self-insure or who transfer risk of losses to a wholly owned captive insurance company could incur large funded and unfunded property and liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their or our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of that control. Because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nWe could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes.\nUnder federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with the property. Owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. In some circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former tenant or manager of the property. Although we generally have indemnification rights against the current tenants or managers of our properties for contamination they cause, that indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. See \u201cGovernment Regulation-Environmental Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nOur REIT Status Risks\nLoss of our status as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.\nIf we lose our status as a REIT (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:\n\u2022We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax;\n\u2022We could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and\n\u2022Unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.\nIn addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain REIT status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a REIT\nfor tax purposes. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, generally including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets, a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and a requirement to make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. Although we believe that we currently qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods.\nThe 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions.\nTo comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders.\nFrom time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements. For example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement.\nIn the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. Any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see \u201cOur Capital Structure Risks-We are highly dependent on access to the capital markets. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on us, including our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy,\u201d above. The terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions.\nTo preserve our qualification as a REIT, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company.\nTo assist us in preserving our qualification as a REIT, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered \u201cexcess shares\u201d and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our Board of Directors. The trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. We also have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares. If we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our Board of Directors. These ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur use of taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited under the Code.\nUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d). This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs\u2019 operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage certain healthcare facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our TRSs that are not on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities (including investing in our tenants) or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make (including investments in our tenants) or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. This limited investment scope could also lead to financial risks or limit our flexibility during times of operating instability.\nThe lease of qualified healthcare properties to a TRS is subject to special requirements.\nWe lease certain healthcare properties to TRSs, which in turn contract with third-party managers to manage the healthcare operations at these properties. The rents we receive from a TRS pursuant to this arrangement are treated as qualifying rents from real property if the healthcare property is a qualified healthcare property (as defined in the Code), the rents are paid pursuant to an arm\u2019s-length lease with a TRS and the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). We have structured the applicable leases and related arrangements in a manner intended to meet these requirements, but there can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions is not satisfied with respect to a particular lease, then the rents we receive with respect to such lease will not be qualifying rents, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with REIT income tests and thus on our ability to qualify as a REIT unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions.\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.\nA REIT\u2019s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us.\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. New legislation, U.S. Treasury Department regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.\nVentas may incur adverse tax consequences if New Senior or any of Ventas\u2019s subsidiary REITs failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nVentas completed its merger with New Senior and received an opinion from REIT counsel to the effect that, at all times starting with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014 and through the closing date, New Senior was organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or any court, and it is possible that the IRS could take a contrary position or that this tax position might not be sustained. If New Senior failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Ventas would succeed to any tax liabilities. These liabilities could be significant, and Ventas could possibly fail to qualify as a REIT. If New Senior failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for the five-year period after the merger, upon a taxable disposition of any of New Senior\u2019s assets, Ventas could be subject to corporate-level tax with respect to all or a portion of the gain so recognized. Ventas\u2019s REIT status also depends on the ongoing qualification of subsidiary entities qualifying as REITs or TRSs, as applicable, as a result of its substantial ownership interest in those entities.", "PERMNO": 75819, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "VTR"}
