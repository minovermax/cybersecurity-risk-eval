RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the other information in this Annual Report, including our financial statements, the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before making investment decisions regarding our common stock:\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has harmed and continues to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth.\n\u2022\nWe are substantially dependent on continued market acceptance in the United States for our 10 kHz Therapy, and the failure of our 10 kHz Therapy to continue to gain market acceptance would negatively impact our business.\n\u2022\nOur success depends on our ability to grow the SCS market by generating awareness and demonstrating the benefits of our therapy for treating PDN and NSRBP.\n\u2022\nWe must educate physicians and demonstrate to them the merits of our 10 kHz Therapy compared to those of our competitors.\n\u2022\nIf our competitors, who are large, well-established companies with substantially greater resources than ours and a long history of competing in the SCS market, are better able to develop and market neuromodulation products (including for new indications, such as PDN) that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use or otherwise more attractive than our Senza systems, our business will be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nWe have a history of significant losses. If we do not achieve and sustain profitability, our financial condition could suffer.\n\u2022\nIf third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of Senza, our revenue will be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nWe currently are, and may in the future become, involved in lawsuits to defend ourselves against intellectual property disputes, which could be expensive and time consuming, and ultimately unsuccessful, and could result in the diversion of significant resources, and hinder our ability to commercialize our existing or future products.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to maintain FDA approval or foreign approval or certification to market and sell Senza, or if such approval or certification is impacted in the future, we will be unable to commercially distribute and market Senza in the United States and abroad. Further, we may not be able to obtain required regulatory approvals or certifications to expand the indications for which we may market and sell Senza.\n\u2022\nWe are in the process of developing internal manufacturing capabilities for our products, but expect to remain dependent upon third-party manufacturers and suppliers, in some cases sole- or single-source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and problems and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to receive access to hospital facilities, our sales may decrease.\n\u2022\nIf clinical studies for future indications do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance, approval or certification in the United States or elsewhere, we will be unable to commercialize our products for these indications.\n\u2022\nWe are required to maintain high levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources, reduce our cash flows and lead to inventory impairment charges.\n\u2022\nSenza is subject to extensive governmental regulation, both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, such as Europe, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nOur stock price has experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. As a result, our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid and such volatility may also adversely impact the value of the 2025 Notes.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and growth have been harmed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic continues to affect our business.\nWe are subject to risks related to the global pandemic associated with COVID-19, as well as similar future public health crises. The COVID-19 outbreak has negatively impacted, and continues to negatively impact our operations and revenues and overall financial condition as demand for elective procedures remains unpredictable and the number of Senza trials and permanent system implant procedures has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The magnitude of the risks and uncertainties are unpredictable and could be further aggravated by the spread of new variants of the COVID-19 virus such as the Delta and Omicron variants, which may be more contagious and/or virulent. During the initial stages of the pandemic, the number of Senza systems procedures performed, similar to other elective surgical procedures, decreased significantly as health care organizations globally prioritized the treatment of patients with COVID-19. For example, in the United States in the first half of 2020 and more recently in connection with the spread of the Omicron variant, governmental authorities recommended, and in certain cases required, that elective, specialty and other procedures and appointments, be suspended or canceled to avoid non-essential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID-19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, overall patient willingness to pursue elective procedures has decreased due to the pandemic. Throughout 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global SCS therapy market, which we estimate decreased by approximately 5% to 10%. These challenges may arise again at any time throughout the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and could reduce our revenue while the pandemic continues.\nNotably, the predictably of trial and permanent implant procedures continues to be challenging to forecast in light of the ongoing pandemic and recent surges in cases caused by the Delta and then Omicron variants. Even if the severity of the pandemic subsides, we are unable to predict the timing that demand for Senza system procedures may return to historic levels as prospective patients may decide to delay their procedures. As a result of the spread of more contagious and virulent variants, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to result in a meaningful delay in patients seeking to have a Senza system trial. Further, we anticipate that the substantial backlog of patients seeking appointments with physicians and surgeries to be performed at hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers relating to a variety of medical conditions will result in patients seeking to have Senza system trials or implant procedures performed having to navigate limited provider capacity, due to, among other reasons, a growing trend of labor shortages with nurses and other healthcare facility staff. We believe these factors may have an adverse effect on the recovery of the global SCS therapy market and, as a result, the amount of time we predict for our sales to recover following the end of the pandemic.\nFurther, numerous state and local jurisdictions have imposed, and others in the future may impose, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Multiple times in 2020, the governor of California, where our headquarters are located, issued \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or \u201cstay at home\u201d orders restricting non-essential activities, travel and business operations for an indefinite period of time, subject to certain exceptions for necessary activities. Such orders or\nrestrictions resulted in our headquarters closing, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects, thereby negatively impacting our operations. Other disruptions or potential disruptions include restrictions on our personnel and personnel of partners to travel and access customers for training and case support; delays in approvals or certifications by regulatory authorities and notified bodies; delays in product development efforts; and additional government requirements or other incremental mitigation efforts that may further impact our capacity to manufacture, sell and support the use of our Senza systems. For instance, in the EU, notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the Medical Devices Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the EU Medical Devices Regulation). While several notified bodies have been designated, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly slowed down their designation process and the current designated notified bodies are facing a large amount of requests with the new regulation as a consequence of which review times have lengthened. This situation could impact our ability to grow our business in the EU and EEA. In addition, even after the lift of \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19, we continue to experience disruptions to our business as a result of patients and customers continuing to be cautious in restarting elective procedures in light of the continued risk posed by the virus.\nGlobal and domestic supply chains and the timely availability of raw materials and products may be materially disrupted by quarantines, factory slowdowns or shutdowns, border closings and travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Any manufacturing supply interruption of materials could adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and future activities.\nWhile the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, the widespread pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity, including our ability to repay our 2.75% convertible senior convertible notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes). We expect any further shelter-in-place policies and restrictions on elective surgical procedures worldwide to have a substantial impact on our revenue. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers, including hospitals, ASCs and physician offices, have experienced financial hardship and some of them may not fully recover. This could lead to some of these customers temporarily or permanently shutting down, filing for bankruptcy or being acquired by larger health systems, leading to reduced procedures and/or additional pricing pressure on our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in a significant increase in unemployment in the United States, Europe and Australia, which may continue even after the pandemic. The occurrence of any such events may lead to reduced disposable income and access to health insurance which could adversely affect the number of Senza systems sold after the pandemic has ended.\nWe are substantially dependent on continued market acceptance in the United States for our 10 kHz Therapy, and the failure of our 10 kHz Therapy to continue to gain market acceptance would negatively impact our business.\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the development and commercialization of Senza and 10 kHz Therapy for the treatment of chronic leg and back pain. We have expanded our commercial efforts since our initial PMA in May 2015, however, we are still in the early stages of our overall commercialization efforts. For example, in July 2021, we received the first FDA approval for the management of chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain, associated with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) utilizing SCS therapy, and we just recently initiated our commercial rollout. In addition, in January 2022, we received FDA approval of our 10 kHz Therapy for the management of non-surgical refractory back pain (NSRBP) (intractable back pain without prior surgery and not a candidate for back surgery), for which we intend to initiate a commercial rollout. The expansion of our commercial efforts, particularly into the PDN indication, is at a very early stage. While we believe the market for SCS in PDN is substantial, it is undeveloped and will require substantial marketing and education efforts by our sales force to develop this market, the success of which is very uncertain. We have incurred significant costs, including costs to continue to build our sales force in the United States, and we expect these costs to continue as we initiate our commercial rollout for the PDN and NSRBP markets. If we are unable to achieve significant market acceptance in the United States, our results of operations will be adversely affected as the United States is the principal market for Senza. If we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to commercialize our products or are unable to market our products as a result of a quality\nproblem, failure to maintain or obtain additional regulatory approvals or certifications, unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects related to our 10 kHz Therapy or the other factors discussed in these risk factors, we would lose our only source of revenue, and our business will be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to gain broader market acceptance for a number of reasons, including due to the below and as a result of other factors set forth herein:\n\u2022\nestablished competitors with strong relationships with customers, including physicians, hospitals and third-party suppliers;\n\u2022\nlimitations in our ability to demonstrate differentiation and advantages of our product compared to competing products and the relative safety, efficacy and ease of use of our product;\n\u2022\nthe limited size of our sales force and the learning curve required to gain experience selling our product;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and challenges in developing and addressing the PDN and NSRBP markets as the first neuromodulation therapy approved for these indications, some of which may be difficult to predict or foresee until later in the commercial rollout;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain sufficient supply of the components for our Senza systems or secure second-source suppliers if our main suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders;\n\u2022\ninsufficient financial or other resources to support our commercialization efforts necessary to reach profitability; and\n\u2022\nthe introduction and market acceptance of new, more effective or less expensive competing products and technologies.\nMoreover, physicians and hospitals may not perceive the benefits of our products and may be unwilling to change from the SCS devices they are currently using. Communicating the benefits of Senza and the 10 kHz Therapy to these physicians and hospitals requires a significant commitment by our marketing team and sales organization. Physicians and hospitals may be slow to change their practices because of perceived risks arising from the use of new products. Physicians may not recommend or use Senza until there is more long-term commercial experience to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods, or until they receive additional recommendations from other physicians that our product is effective. We cannot predict when, if ever, physicians and hospitals may adopt use of our product. If we are unable to educate physicians and hospitals about the advantages of our 10 kHz Therapy, do not continue to gain market acceptance of our product, or fail to significantly grow our market share, we will not be able to grow our revenue and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe must educate physicians and demonstrate to them the merits of our 10 kHz Therapy compared to those of our competitors.\nPhysicians play a significant role in determining the course of a patient\u2019s treatment and the type of product that will be used to treat a patient. An important part of our sales process includes the education of physicians on the safe and effective use of our 10 kHz Therapy and our Senza systems, particularly because Senza and high-frequency neuromodulation treatment is relatively new as compared to existing low-frequency traditional SCS systems, and is the first non-drug product approved for use in the management of certain types of chronic pain associated with PDN, as well as being the only SCS therapy for the management of NSRBP. As a result, our ability to address, develop and grow the markets for our 10 kHz Therapy and, ultimately our success, depends, in large part, on effectively educating physicians about our 10 kHz Therapy, including the results of our pivotal clinical studies.\nIn order for us to sell our products, we must successfully demonstrate to physicians the merits of our 10 kHz Therapy compared to our competitors\u2019 products. Acceptance of our 10 kHz Therapy depends on educating physicians as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety, ease of use and cost-effectiveness of Senza as compared to our competitors\u2019 products, as well as in new indications such as those we have received with respect to PDN and NSRBP, and then communicating to physicians the proper application of our 10 kHz Therapy. Physicians typically need to perform several procedures to become comfortable using 10 kHz Therapy and Senza. If a physician experiences difficulties during an initial procedure or otherwise, that physician may be less likely to\ncontinue to use our product or to recommend it to other physicians. As a result, educating physicians on the proper use of Senza is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts. If we are not successful in educating physicians and convincing them of the merits of our 10 kHz Therapy or educating them on the use of Senza, they may not use our Senza systems and we may be unable to increase our sales, sustain our growth or achieve profitability.\nIn addition, we believe receiving support of our products from physicians is essential for market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive support from physicians or long-term data does not show the benefits of using our 10 kHz Therapy, physicians may not use Senza. In such circumstances, our results of operations would be materially adversely affected. It is also important for our growth that these physicians advocate for the benefits of our products in the broader marketplace. If physicians misuse or ineffectively use our products, it could result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injuries, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially greater resources than we have and have a long history of competing in the SCS market.\nOur most significant competitors are publicly traded, or are divisions of publicly traded, major medical device companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we have. The 2019 global SCS market, before the COVID-19 pandemic, was estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion, with the United States comprising approximately 80% of the market at that time. Given the size of the existing and potential market in the United States, we expect that as we work to increase our market position and penetration in the United States our competitors will take aggressive action to protect their current market position. For example, in May 2015, a unit of Boston Scientific, one of our principal competitors, filed with the USPTO two petitions for inter partes review challenging the validity of our U.S. Patent No. 8,359,102 (the \u2018102 patent), which the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB) at the USPTO denied in November 2015, and, in December 2016 and April 2018, filed lawsuits against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that we infringed their patents covering technology related to stimulation leads, batteries and telemetry units, and alleging theft of trade secrets and tortious interference with contract. We will face significant competition in establishing our market share in the United States and may encounter unforeseen obstacles and competitive challenges in the United States.\nIn addition, we face a particular challenge overcoming the long-standing practices by some physicians of using the neuromodulation products of our larger, more established competitors. Physicians who have completed many successful implants using the neuromodulation products made by these competitors may be reluctant to try new products from a source with which they are less familiar. If these physicians do not try and subsequently adopt our product, then our revenue growth will slow or decline.\nFurther, a number of our competitors are currently conducting, or we anticipate will be conducting, clinical studies to demonstrate the results of their SCS systems. The results of these studies may be equivalent to, or potentially better than, the results of our pivotal U.S. trial.\nIf our competitors are better able to develop and market neuromodulation products that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use or otherwise more attractive than our Senza systems, our business will be adversely impacted.\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to technological change. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to establish a competitive position in the neuromodulation market by securing broad market acceptance of our 10 kHz Therapy and our Senza systems for the treatment of approved chronic pain conditions. Any product we develop that achieves regulatory clearance, approval or certification will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the neuromodulation market are demonstrated clinical effectiveness, product safety, reliability and durability, ease of use, product support and service, minimal side effects, pricing and contracting, and salesforce experience and relationships. We face significant competition in the United States and internationally, which we believe will continue to intensify. For example, our major competitors, Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories, each has approved neuromodulation systems in at least the United States, Europe, and Australia and have been established for several years. Further, since the launch of our product, these major competitors have all launched new SCS systems:\nMedtronic launched the Intellis system, Boston Scientific launched the Spectra WaveWriter SCS system, the WaveWriter Alpha SCS system and the Fast-Acting Sub-perception Therapy, and Abbott Laboratories launched the Proclaim system. We believe these competitors will continue to launch new products, waveforms, and datasets to remain competitive. For example, in early 2020 Medtronic announced the acquisition of Stimgenics, a company that has developed a specific waveform (DTM) with a purported mechanism of action, and the results of an RCT which had superior results versus traditional SCS. The DTM waveforms have been launched, and launches such as these could result in a reduction of our differentiation in the marketplace. In addition, in January 2022, Medtronic announced that it had received FDA approval of its Intellis rechargeable neurostimulator and Vanda recharge-free neurostimulator for the treatment of chronic pain associate with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which will directly compete with Senza in the new PDN market.\nIn addition to these major competitors, we also face competition from companies such as Stimwave, Saluda, Mainstay Medical and Nalu Medical, and may face competition from Neuspera Medical and Biotronik in the future. These companies are becoming more active in the SCS market. For instance, in the first quarter of 2019, Stimwave received FDA clearance for 10 kHz stimulation, expanding their previous clearance for low frequency therapy, Nalu Medical received FDA clearance in the first quarter of 2019 for their SCS system, and Saluda Medical received certification in the European Union (EU) in the third quarter of 2019 for their SCS system, were added to the Prostheses List for the same system in Australia in July of 2020 and could potentially launch their SCS system in the United States as early as the end of 2021. Additionally, there are other emerging competitors with active neuromodulation system development programs that may emerge in the future. Many of the companies developing or marketing competing products either enjoy or may develop several advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\nmore experienced sales forces;\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition;\n\u2022\nmore established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks;\n\u2022\nearlier regulatory approval or certification;\n\u2022\nlong established relationships with physicians and hospitals;\n\u2022\nthe ability to offer competitive products at a lower price;\n\u2022\nsignificant patent portfolios, including issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, as well as the resources to enforce patents against us or any of our third-party suppliers and distributors;\n\u2022\nthe ability to acquire and integrate our competitors and/or their technology;\n\u2022\ndemonstrated ability to develop product enhancements and new product offerings;\n\u2022\nestablished history of product reliability, safety and durability;\n\u2022\nthe ability to offer rebates or bundle multiple product offerings to offer greater discounts or incentives;\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human resources for product development, sales, and marketing; and\n\u2022\ngreater experience in and resources for conducting R&D, clinical studies, manufacturing, preparing regulatory submissions, obtaining regulatory clearance, approval or certification for products and marketing approved or certified products.\nOur competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than we do, obtain patents that may apply to us at any time, obtain regulatory clearances, approvals or certifications for competing products more rapidly than we do or develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or less competitive. We also face fierce competition in recruiting and retaining qualified sales, scientific, and management personnel, establishing clinical studies sites and enrolling patients in clinical studies. If our competitors are more successful than we are in these matters, our business may be harmed.\nWe have a history of significant losses. If we do not achieve and sustain profitability, our financial condition could suffer.\nWe have experienced significant net losses, and have no assurance that we will achieve profitability. We expect to continue to incur losses as we build our U.S. commercial operations and continue to investigate the use of our 10 kHz Therapy to treat other chronic pain conditions. We incurred net losses of $131.4 million, $83.1 million and $103.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit was $624.2 million. Our prior losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. If our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability and our financial condition could suffer. Our patent infringement lawsuits with Boston Scientific Corporation have caused us to, and may continue to cause us to, incur substantial legal expenses. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nOur ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of our products.\nCurrently, the gross profit generated from the sale of our Senza systems is not sufficient to cover our operating expenses. To achieve our operating and strategic goals, we will, among other things, need to reduce the per-unit manufacturing cost of Senza. This cannot be achieved without increasing the volume of components that we purchase in order to take advantage of volume-based pricing discounts, improving manufacturing efficiency or increasing our volume to leverage manufacturing overhead costs. While we made the strategic decision in the third quarter of 2020 to reduce our reliance on third party manufacturers by initiating a plan to establish manufacturing operations in Costa Rica, which is, at least in part, intended to improve our long-term gross margin, there can be no assurance such actions will be successful or not ultimately result in us incurring more costs. If we are unable to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing overhead costs per unit, our ability to achieve profitability will be severely constrained. Any increase in manufacturing volumes is dependent upon a corresponding increase in sales. The occurrence of one or more factors that negatively impact the manufacturing or sales of Senza or reduce our manufacturing efficiency may prevent us from achieving our desired reduction in manufacturing costs, which would negatively affect our operating results and may prevent us from attaining profitability.\nIf third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of Senza, our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nOur success in marketing our products depends and will depend in large part on whether U.S. and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of our products.\nIn the United States, we expect to derive nearly all our revenue from sales of our products to hospitals and outpatient medical facilities who typically bill various third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations, to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with our products and bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for SCS procedures using Senza (and our other products in development) by third-party payors is essential to the acceptance of our products by our customers.\nWe believe that SCS procedures using our products are adequately described by existing CPT, HCPCS II and ICD-10-CM codes for the implantation of spinal cord stimulators and related leads performed in various sites of care, although such codes generally do not specifically describe procedures using either low-frequency or high-frequency stimulation. In the United States, although CMS approved a transitional pass-through payment for High-Frequency Stimulation under the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system effective as of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, our customers currently do not receive separate reimbursement for our products. In addition, effective July 1, 2021, Medicare now requires Prior Authorization for certain hospital outpatient procedures, including SCS procedures.\nAccordingly, we believe that some of our target customers may be unwilling to adopt Senza over more established or lower-cost therapeutic alternatives already available or that may subsequently become available. Further, any decline in the amount payors are willing to reimburse our customers for SCS procedures using Senza could make it difficult for new customers to adopt Senza and could create additional pricing pressure for us, which could adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services can differ significantly from payor to payor. For our traditional chronic back and leg pain market, we believe that favorable coverage and reimbursement of procedures using our products from Medicare and certain commercial payors, such as Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Kaiser, have contributed to our increase in revenue to date, while we continue to engage in efforts to educate payors on the advantages of 10 kHz Therapy. However, there can be no assurance that all private health insurance plans will cover procedures using the product. We currently have more limited coverage and reimbursement for use of our therapy in PDN and NSRBP patients and are working to expand payor coverage to include the use of our 10 kHz Therapy in this patient population. This effort could be costly and could take many years to gain broad acceptance, and there can be no guarantee that it will be successful. A significant number of negative coverage and reimbursement decisions by private insurers may impair our ability or delay our ability to grow our revenue. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these new products and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained, or maintained if obtained.\nReimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets, there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. If sufficient coverage and reimbursement is not available for our current or future products, in either the United States or internationally, the demand for our products and our revenues will be adversely affected.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which are expensive and time consuming, and ultimately unsuccessful, and could result in the diversion of significant resources, thereby hindering our ability to effectively grow sales of our Senza systems or commercialize future products, if any. If we are unable to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property, our business will be negatively affected.\nThe market for medical devices is subject to rapid technological change and frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. It is possible that our patents or licenses may not withstand challenges made by others or protect our rights adequately.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to secure effective patent protection for our products and processes in the United States and internationally. We have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications for various aspects of our technology and trademark applications to protect our brand and business. We seek to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights to restrict the ability of others to market products or services that misappropriate our technology and/or infringe our intellectual property to compete with our products. We are currently involved in, and in the future may become involved in additional, lawsuits and/or proceedings to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. These lawsuits and proceedings are expensive and require substantial attention of management.\nHowever, we face the risks that:\n\u2022\nWe may fail to secure necessary patents, potentially permitting competitors to market competing products and make, use or sell products that are substantially the same as ours without incurring the sizeable development costs that we have incurred, which would adversely affect our ability to compete.\n\u2022\nPatents may not issue from any of our currently pending or future patent applications.\n\u2022\nOur already-granted patents and any future patents may not survive legal challenges, including challenges in the ongoing lawsuit with Boston Scientific, to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us, and they may be re-examined or invalidated, and/or may be found to be unenforceable or not cover competing products.\n\u2022\nEven if our patents are determined by a court to be valid and enforceable, they may not be drafted or interpreted broadly enough to prevent others from marketing products and services similar to ours. Similarly, others may simply design around our patents. For example, third parties may be able to make systems or devices that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of our patents. Third parties may assert that we or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications. The claims of our issued patents or patent applications when issued may not cover our commercial technology or the future products and services that we develop. We may not have freedom to operate unimpeded by the patent rights of others. Third parties may have dominating, blocking or other patents relevant to our technology of which we are not aware. In addition, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the filing of certain priority documents (or, in some cases, are not published until they issue as patents) and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for our technology or our contemplated technology. Any such patent applications may have priority over our patent applications or issued patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, depending on when the timing of the filing date falls under certain patent laws, we may have to participate in a priority contest (such as an interference proceeding) declared by the USPTO, to determine priority of invention in the United States. There may be prior public disclosures that could invalidate our inventions or parts of our inventions of which we are not aware. Further, we may not develop additional proprietary technologies and, even if we do, they may not be patentable.\n\u2022\nPatent law can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important principles remain unresolved. In the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions, policies regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents can be inconsistent. The U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications, our ability to obtain patents or the patents and patent applications of our licensors. Future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nMonitoring unauthorized uses of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we seek to analyze our competitors\u2019 products and services. For example, we filed a lawsuit in November 2016 against Boston Scientific Corporation in order to enforce certain of our patents, we filed a lawsuit in February 2019 for patent infringement and false advertisement against Stimwave, we filed a lawsuit in February 2020 for patent infringement against Nalu Medical, and we filed another lawsuit in February 2021 for patent infringement against Boston Scientific. We may in the future seek to enforce our patents or other proprietary rights against other potential infringements. However, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar\ntechnology. Any inability to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our product features, which could reduce demand for our products. In addition, we may need to defend our patents from third-party challenges, including interferences, derivation proceedings, re-examination proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review, third-party submissions, oppositions, nullity actions, or other patent proceedings. We may also need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Adverse proceedings such as litigation or challenges to the validity of our patents can be expensive, time consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical and managerial personnel, which could in turn harm our business, whether or not we receive a determination favorable to us. In addition, in an infringement or other adverse proceeding, a court may decide that the patent we seek to enforce is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that the patent in question does not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or proceeding could place one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or found unenforceable. Some of our competitors may be able to devote significantly more resources to intellectual property litigation, and may have significantly broader patent portfolios to assert against us, if we assert our rights against them. Further, because of the substantial discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be disclosed or otherwise compromised during litigation.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate or control our future operating expenses in relation to obtaining, enforcing and/or defending intellectual property, which could lead to cash shortfalls. Our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation.\n\u2022\nWe may also be forced to enter into cross-license agreements with competitors in order to manufacture, use, sell, import and/or export products or services that are covered by our competitors\u2019 intellectual property rights. If we need to use our intellectual property to enter such cross-license agreements, it may compromise the value of our intellectual property due to the fact that our competitors may be able to manufacture, use, sell, import and/or export our patented technology.\nFor additional information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, see \u201cRisks Related to Intellectual Property.\u201d\nIf we fail to develop and retain an effective direct sales force in the United States, our business could suffer.\nAs we increase our commercial and marketing efforts, we will need to retain, develop and grow the number of direct sales personnel that we employ. We continue to make a significant investment in recruiting and training sales representatives and clinical representatives. There is significant competition for sales personnel experienced in relevant medical device sales. Once hired, the training process is lengthy because it requires significant education for new sales representatives to achieve the level of clinical competency with our products expected by physicians. Upon completion of the training, our sales representatives typically require lead time in the field to grow their network of accounts and achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach in any individual territory. Furthermore, the use of our products often requires or benefits from direct support from us. If we are unable to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel, or if our sales representatives do not achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach, our revenue will not grow at the rate we expect and our financial performance will suffer. For example, during the first half of 2018, we hired sales personnel at a slower rate that we had expected, which, among other factors, caused us to lower our expectations for full year 2018 worldwide revenue. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from our competitors, our new sales representatives will usually be subject to restrictive covenants with their former employers, including non-competition, non-solicitation and/or confidentiality provisions. As a result, we may have to wait until applicable non-competition provisions have expired before deploying such personnel in restricted territories or incur costs to relocate personnel outside of such territories. We and certain of our new sales representatives have been, continue to be, and may in the future be, subject to allegations that these new hires have violated the non-competition clauses, been improperly solicited or divulged to us proprietary or other confidential information of their former employers. Any of these risks may adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to maintain FDA approval or foreign approval or certification to market and sell Senza, or if such approval or certification is impacted in the future, we will be unable to commercially distribute and market Senza in the United States and abroad. Further, we may not be able to obtain required regulatory approvals or certifications to expand the indications for which we may market and sell Senza.\nWe and our products are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and elsewhere, including by the FDA and its foreign counterparts.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities enforce these regulatory requirements through periodic unannounced inspections. We do not know whether we will pass any future FDA or foreign regulatory authorities inspections. For example, while we have received FDA approval of our Senza PMA application, there can be no assurance that approval will be maintained. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to maintain to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our product is safe and effective for its intended use;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to comply with the guidelines required by FDA and other agencies to maintain our PMA approval; and\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing processes and facilities we and our vendors use may not meet applicable requirements to maintain our PMA approval.\nIn addition, we may suffer from product liability or other issues that impact our ability to continue to market the Senza systems in the United States.\nFailing to maintain FDA approval or foreign approval or certification could result in unexpected and significant costs for us and consume management\u2019s time and other resources. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies could ask us to improve or augment manufacturing processes, collect and provide data on the quality or safety of our product or issue us warning letters relating to matters that may result in removal of our product from the market. Additionally, we will be required to obtain FDA approval or notified body certification prior to making any modification to the device, and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may revoke the approval or certification or impose other restrictions if post-market data demonstrates safety issues or lack of effectiveness. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals or certifications, our financial condition may be adversely affected, and our ability to grow domestically and internationally would likely be limited. Further, the failure to obtain approval or certification for new products and new indications, such as painful diabetic neuropathy, on existing products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nModifications to our products may require us to obtain new PMA approvals or approvals of a PMA supplement, or any similar approval or certification and if we market modified products without obtaining necessary approvals or certifications, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified products until required approvals or certifications are obtained.\nCertain modifications to a PMA-approved device may require approval of a new PMA or a PMA supplement, or alternatively a notification or other submission to the FDA. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether a new PMA or PMA supplement is necessary. We may make modifications to our approved devices in the future that we believe do not require approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit a new PMA or PMA supplement for modifications to our previously approved products, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, the FDA may not approve our products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization or could require clinical trials to support any modifications. With respect to PMA-approved devices, any changes to the manufacturing processes, including manufacturing site changes such as the planned change to assemble our Senza systems at our Costa Rica facility when completed, may require prior approval of a PMA supplement before such\nchanges may be implemented. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nIn the EU, we must inform the notified body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices that we market or sell in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) (which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), of any planned substantial changes to our quality system or substantial changes to our medical devices that could affect compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation or cause a substantial change to the intended use for which the device has been CE marked. The notified body will then assess the planned changes and verify whether they affect the products\u2019 ongoing conformity with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. If the assessment is favorable, the notified body will issue a new certificate of conformity or an addendum to the existing certificate attesting compliance with the general safety and performance requirements and quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the EU Medical Devices Regulation.\nOur growth and success depends on physicians\u2019 use of our 10 kHz Therapy to treat chronic back pain, as well as the development and success in the PDN and NSRBP markets.\nOur growth and success is dependent on physicians\u2019 acceptance and use of our 10 kHz Therapy to treat chronic back pain and our development and success in the markets for our newest indications, PDN and NSRBP. We believe a significant limitation of current neuromodulation systems is the limited evidence supporting efficacy of traditional SCS products. Senza utilizes high-frequency stimulation technology capable of delivering waveform of up to 10,000 Hz for spinal cord stimulation that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both leg and back pain and the management of chronic pain associated with PDN and NSRBP. However, we may face challenges convincing physicians, many of whom have extensive experience with competitors\u2019 SCS products and established relationships with other companies, to appreciate the benefits of the 10 kHz Therapy and, in particular, its ability to treat back pain as well as leg pain, and adopt it for treatment of their patients. If Senza is unable to gain acceptance by physicians for the treatment of PDN, NSRBP or other pain indications for which its use is approved or certified, our potential to expand the existing neuromodulation market will be significantly limited and our revenue potential will be negatively impacted.\nOur international operations subject us to certain operating risks, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we sell Senza directly in the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway and Germany and through distributors and agents located in Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Turkey and Kuwait. The sale and shipment of Senza across international borders, as well as the purchase of components from international sources, subject us to United States and foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws.\nCompliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as export controls laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting.\nOur international operations expose us and our distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and in defending against third-party threats and intellectual property enforcement actions against us, our distributors, or any of our third-party suppliers;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\na shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;\n\u2022\nthird-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of Senza;\n\u2022\nrelative disadvantages compared to competitors with established business and customer relationships;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022\neconomic instability;\n\u2022\nvirus epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak;\n\u2022\nchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to international trade, including any retaliatory tariffs or other actions taken by foreign countries in response to the U.S. tariffs imposed and threatened by the United States presidential administration;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u2022\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities that could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity; and\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new trade restrictions.\nIf we experience any of these risks, our sales in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be harmed and our results of operations would suffer.\nWe are in the process of developing internal manufacturing capabilities for our products, but expect to remain dependent upon third-party manufacturers and suppliers, in some cases sole- or single-source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and problems and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for our products, and to date, have outsourced all our manufacturing operations to third parties. We are in the process of developing our first in-house manufacturing capabilities in our new product manufacturing facility in Costa Rica, which we expect, if successfully completed, will enable us to partially reduce our reliance on our third-party manufacturers and improve our long-term gross margins. In order to develop internal manufacturing expertise, we may be forced to devote greater resources and management time than anticipated, particularly in areas relating to operations, quality, regulatory, facilities and information technology. We also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes. If we experience unanticipated employee shortage or turnover in any of these areas, we may not be able to effectively manage our planned manufacturing operations and we may not achieve the operating efficiencies that we anticipate from developing these capabilities, which may negatively affect our product manufacturing processes or result in difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Further, we have never developed or conducted any manufacturing activities in-house, and as a result, our inexperience could exacerbate the likelihood and/or impact of any of the above factors occurring. Any such problems could seriously harm our business. Even if we are\nsuccessful in developing our internal manufacturing capabilities, we will continue to rely on a limited number of suppliers who manufacture and assemble certain components of our products.\nThe facilities used by us and third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products must be approved by the FDA and any comparable foreign regulatory authority or notified body pursuant to inspections or audits that will be conducted after we submit a PMA to the FDA or any comparable filing to a foreign regulatory authority or notified body. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, any third-party manufacturers we utilize for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements or similar foreign requirements for manufacture of our products. If we or our third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority or notified body, we or they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval or certification for use of these manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority or notified body does not approve or certify these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such approval or certification in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval or certification for or market our products. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or certifications, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\nIn addition, our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including, for example, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, equipment malfunction and environmental factors, failure to properly conduct their own business affairs and infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our requirements. Our suppliers may also encounter problems sourcing key components due to supply shortages. For example, in 2021, there is a global shortage of microchips. Should this shortage continue, our ability to produce and sell goods could be significantly impacted. Our reliance on these third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\nthird parties may threaten or enforce their intellectual property rights against our suppliers, which may cause disruptions or delays in shipment, or may force our suppliers to cease conducting business with us;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate supplies from one or more vendors in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nwe are not a major customer of many of our suppliers, and these suppliers may therefore give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours;\n\u2022\nour suppliers, especially new suppliers, may make errors in manufacturing that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products, impacting our ability to maintain our PMA approval or similar foreign approval or certification, or cause delays in shipment, impacting our ability to meet demand in the United States or international markets;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers;\n\u2022\nswitching components or suppliers, including our planned vertical integration of certain manufacturing capabilities at our new Costa Rica facility, may require product redesign and possibly submission to FDA, notified bodies or other foreign regulatory bodies, which could significantly impede or delay our commercial activities;\n\u2022\nwe may incur additional costs in switching from certain existing suppliers in connection with our planned build-out of our Costa Rica manufacturing facility;\n\u2022\none or more of our sole- or single-source suppliers may be unwilling or unable to supply components of our products, or may supply products that do not meet our product requirements;\n\u2022\nother customers may use fair or unfair negotiation tactics and/or pressures to impede our use of the supplier;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of epidemic or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, which may cause one or more of our suppliers to close their operations either temporarily or permanently;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of a fire, natural disaster or other catastrophe impacting one or more of our suppliers may affect their ability to deliver products to us in a timely manner; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers may encounter financial or other business hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nWe may not be able to quickly establish additional or alternative suppliers for commercialization in the United States if necessary, in part because we may need to undertake additional activities to qualify such suppliers as required by the regulatory approval process. Similar risk may exist in foreign jurisdictions. Any interruption or delay in obtaining products from our third-party suppliers, or our inability to obtain products from qualified alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to switch to competing products. Given our reliance on certain single-source suppliers, we are especially susceptible to supply shortages because we do not have alternate suppliers currently available.\nWe rely upon third-party, single-source, and in certain cases sole-source, suppliers for many of the components and materials used in our products, and for critical manufacturing and packaging services, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm our business.\nA number of the critical components used in our products are supplied to us from single-source, or in certain cases sole-source, suppliers, including leads, lead extenders, surgical leads, neurostimulator components and telemetry modules. Our ability to supply our products commercially depends, in part, on our ability to obtain a supply of these components that have been manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization and clinical testing. In some cases, we have not entered into manufacturing, supply or quality agreements with our single-source and sole-source suppliers, some of which supply components critical to our products. We are not certain that our single-source or sole-source suppliers will be able to meet our demand for their products and services, either because of the nature of our agreements with those suppliers, or our limited experience with those suppliers, or due to our relative importance as a customer to those suppliers or otherwise. It may be difficult for us to assess their ability to timely meet our demand in the future based on past performance. While our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products on a timely basis in the past, they may subordinate our needs in the future to the needs of their other customers.\nEstablishing additional or replacement suppliers for the components or processes used in Senza systems, if required, may not be accomplished quickly. If we are able to find a replacement supplier, such replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval or certification, which could result in further delay. While we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the single-source or sole-source components and materials used in our products, any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders. In addition, from time to time, certain of our suppliers experience interruptions and variances in their manufacturing processes, including suppliers of our leads and batteries. Because we are reliant on these single source suppliers, we are particularly susceptible to supply shortages and, if one of our suppliers were to experience an ongoing or continued manufacturing problem, and, in particular, our leads and battery suppliers, our ability to meet our forecasted commercial demand could be materially and negatively impacted.\nIf our third-party suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of materials, or the level of services we require, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and on a timely basis, the continued commercialization of Senza would be impeded, delayed, limited or prevented, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.\nTo achieve our revenue goals, we must successfully increase manufacturing output to meet expected customer demand. In the future, we may experience difficulties with manufacturing yields, quality control, component supply and shortages of qualified personnel, among other problems. These problems could result in delays in product availability and increases in expenses. Any such delay or increased expense could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nFuture growth will also impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. In addition, rapid and significant growth will place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nIn order to manage our operations and growth we will need to continue to improve our operational and management controls, reporting and information technology systems and financial internal control procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our operating results and business could suffer.\nIf we fail to receive access to hospital facilities, our sales may decrease.\nIn the United States, in order for physicians to use Senza, the hospital facilities where these physicians treat patients typically require us to enter into purchasing contracts. The process of securing a satisfactory contract can be lengthy and time-consuming and require extensive negotiations and management time. In the EU, from time to time, certain institutions require us to engage in a contract bidding process in the event that such institutions are considering making purchase commitments that exceed specified cost thresholds, which vary by jurisdiction. These processes are only open at certain periods of time, and we may not be successful in the bidding process. If we do not receive access to hospital facilities via these contracting processes or otherwise, or if we are unable to secure contracts or tender successful bids, our sales may stagnate or decrease and our operating results may be harmed. Furthermore, we may expend significant effort in these time-consuming processes and still may not obtain a purchase contract from such hospitals.\nWe rely in part on a small group of third-party distributors to effectively distribute our products in certain countries outside the United States.\nWe depend in part on medical device distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in certain territories in Europe. We depend on these distributors\u2019 efforts to market our products, yet we are unable to control their efforts completely. These distributors typically sell a variety of other, non-competing products that may limit the resources they dedicate to selling Senza. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell Senza in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer. Recruiting and retaining qualified third-party distributors and training them in our technology and product offering requires time and resources. To develop and expand our distribution, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our distributors. Further, if our relationship with a successful distributor terminates, we may be unable to replace that distributor without disruption to our business. If we fail to maintain positive relationships with our distributors, fail to develop new relationships with other distributors, including in new markets, fail to manage, train or incentivize existing distributors effectively, or fail to provide distributors with competitive products on attractive terms, or if these distributors are not successful in their sales efforts, our revenue may decrease and our operating results, reputation and business may be harmed.\nWe may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nManufacturing and marketing Senza, and clinical testing of our 10 kHz Therapy, may expose us to product liability and other tort claims. Although we have, and intend to maintain, liability insurance, the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, in 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the FFDCA did not preempt state laws in a product liability case involving a medical device\ncompany. If other courts in the United States adopt similar rulings, we may be subject to increased litigation risk in connection with our products. Product liability claims could negatively affect our reputation, continued product sales, and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products.\nIf clinical studies for future indications do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance, approval or certification in the United States or elsewhere, we will be unable to commercialize our products for these indications.\nClinical studies are necessary to support PMA applications or similar foreign applications or submissions and may be necessary to support PMA supplements or similar foreign applications or submissions for modified versions of our marketed device products. This would require the enrollment of large numbers of suitable subjects, which may be difficult to identify, recruit and maintain as participants in the clinical study. Adverse outcomes in the post-approval studies could also result in restrictions or withdrawal of approval of the PMA or similar foreign approval or certification. We will likely need to conduct additional clinical studies in the future to support new indications for our products or for approvals, clearances or certifications of new product lines, or for the approval or certification of the use of our products in some foreign countries. For example, we are currently conducting clinical studies for Senza to explore the potential for 10 kHz Therapy to treat certain chronic pain conditions, including chronic upper limb and neck pain and non-surgical refractory back pain. We will likely need to conduct additional clinical studies in the future to support regulatory approval or certification for the use of our products to treat some of these new indications. Clinical testing can take many years, is expensive and carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), Ethics Committees, competent authorities of the EU member states or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical study protocol, force us to modify a previously approved protocol, or place a clinical study on hold;\n\u2022\npatients do not enroll in, or enroll at a lower rate than we expect, or do not complete a clinical study;\n\u2022\npatients or investigators do not comply with study protocols;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, or may find the clinical trial design, conduct or results inadequate to prove safety or efficacy, and may require us to pursue additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could further delay the clearance or approval of our products and similar risk exists in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npatients do not return for post-treatment follow-up at the expected rate;\n\u2022\npatients experience serious or unexpected adverse side effects for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our products such as the advanced stage of co-morbidities that may exist at the time of treatment, causing a clinical study to be put on hold;\n\u2022\nsites participating in an ongoing clinical study withdraw, requiring us to engage new sites;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays associated with establishing additional clinical sites;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators decline to participate in our clinical studies, do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule, or perform in a manner inconsistent with the investigator agreement, clinical study protocol, good clinical practices, other FDA, IRB or Ethics Committee requirements, and other foreign regulations governing clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthird-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nregulatory inspections of our clinical studies or manufacturing facilities require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nchanges in federal, state, or foreign governmental statutes, regulations or policies;\n\u2022\ninterim or final results are inconclusive or unfavorable as to immediate and long-term safety or efficacy;\n\u2022\nthe study design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy; or\n\u2022\nthe statistical endpoints are not met.\nIn addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical studies. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing. Our clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or non-clinical studies in addition to those we have planned. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance, approval or certification and, ultimately, the commercialization of that device or indication for use.\nWe could also encounter delays if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities concludes that our financial relationships with investigators results in a perceived or actual conflict of interest that may have affected the interpretation of a study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical study site or the utility of the clinical study itself. Principal investigators for our clinical studies may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash compensation and/or equity-based awards in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation to or ownership interest by the clinical investigator carrying out the study result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities concludes that the financial relationship may have affected interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical study site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical study itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies refusing to accept the data as support for our future applications. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing any of our products currently in development.\nEven if our products are approved in the United States, Australia and certified in the EEA, comparable regulatory authorities of additional foreign countries and/or notified bodies must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of our products in those countries. Approval or certification procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, Australia or the EEA, including additional preclinical studies or clinical studies. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nEven though we may generate positive data to support the use of our therapy and products for market expansion opportunities, and receive approval or certification to expand our indications for use to include additional indications, internal and external factors may make it more difficult for these additional indications and market expansion opportunities, or any other indications or other market expansion opportunities we may pursue in the future, to be commercially successful.\nEven if we get approval or certification to expand our indications for use or generate positive data to support the use of our therapy and products for other market expansion opportunities, internal and external factors may make it more difficult for such expanded indications or uses to be commercially successful. These factors include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nthe perceived efficacy and safety of our therapy and products for such additional indications or uses by healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nthe scope, effectiveness and strength of product education, marketing and distribution support, including our sales and marketing team, for such new additional indications or uses;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our therapy and products for such additional indications or uses for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\neducation and awareness of patients, treating physicians and referring physicians concerning the use of our therapy and products for such additional indications or uses;\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement for such additional indications or uses;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and political unrest that could inhibit our ability to promote such new indications or uses and can negatively affect product demand by creating obstacles for patients to seek treatment and undergo elective procedures; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our competitors to obtain similar approvals, such as Medtronic\u2019s recent PDN approval, and to more successfully commercialize on such market expansion opportunities.\nFor example, even though we have received approval for 10 kHz Therapy for the management of chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain, associated with PDN and the management of NSRBP (intractable back pain without prior surgery and not a candidate for back surgery), we will still be required to educate patients and healthcare professionals of the benefits of our therapy and products for the treatment of PDN and NSRBP. If we are unable to successfully educate patients and healthcare professionals, including referring physicians, we will not be able to establish our 10 kHz Therapy as a viable treatment option for eligible PDN and NSRBP patients. Further, we will also be required to either engage and build, or to otherwise contract, a salesforce network to market 10 kHz Therapy for the treatment of PDN. Any such effort could be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no guarantee that it will be successful. In addition, we will also need to establish payor acceptance of 10 kHz Therapy as a treatment option within the PDN and NSRBP patient communities, a process that may not be successful and could take many years to gain broad acceptance. In addition to the foregoing factors, for our therapy for patients with NSRBP to be commercially successful it will require physicians who treat chronic back pain patients with back surgery to refer those patients to other physicians to perform an SCS procedure.\nAs a result of the above factors, any future indications or uses of our therapy and products we may pursue may not be successfully commercialized and as a result, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nIf we fail to retain our key executives or recruit and hire new employees, our operations and financial results may be adversely effected while we attract other highly qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain our executive officers and other key employees, and recruit and hire new employees. All of our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, and therefore may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and may harm our business.\nIn addition, many of our employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of our stock or be able to exercise a substantial number of stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock. Further, our employees\u2019 ability to exercise those options and sell their stock in a public market may result in a higher than normal turnover rate.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to retain executive officers and other key employees and attract new key employees. Many executive officers and other employees in the neuromodulation and medical device industry are subject to strict non-competition, non-solicitation and/or confidentiality agreements with their employers, including our main competitors Medtronic plc, Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories. Our competitors may allege breaches of, and seek to enforce, such non-competition, non-solicitation and/or confidentiality agreements or initiate litigation based on such agreements, particularly now that we have entered the U.S. market. Such litigation, whether or not meritorious, may impede our ability to attract, hire or utilize executive officers and other key employees who have been or are currently employed by our competitors.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe currently are, and may in the future become, involved in lawsuits to defend ourselves against intellectual property disputes, which could be expensive and time consuming, and ultimately unsuccessful, and could result in the diversion of significant resources, and hinder our ability to commercialize our existing or future products.\nOur success depends in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of others. Intellectual property disputes can be costly to defend and may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. Significant litigation regarding patent rights occurs in the medical industry. Whether merited or not, it is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products. We may also face allegations that our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property rights of their former employers or other third parties. For example, on December 9, 2016, Boston Scientific filed a patent infringement lawsuit alleging our manufacture, use and sale of the Senza system infringes certain of Boston Scientific\u2019s patents covering technology related to stimulation leads, batteries and telemetry units. On April 27, 2018, Boston Scientific filed a second lawsuit alleging patent infringement, theft of trade secrets, and tortious interference with contract.\nOur competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit, or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, and/or export our products. For example, our major competitors, Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories, each have significant patent portfolios covering systems, sub-systems, methods, and manufacturing processes. These competitors may have one or more patents for which they can threaten and/or initiate patent infringement actions against us and/or any of our third-party suppliers. Our ability to defend ourselves and/or our third-party suppliers may be limited by our financial and human resources, the availability of reasonable defenses, and the ultimate acceptance of our defenses by the courts or juries. Further, if such patents are successfully asserted against us, this may result in an adverse impact on our business, including injunctions, damages and/or attorneys\u2019 fees. From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we may develop non-infringement and/or invalidity positions with respect to third-party patents, which may or not be ultimately adjudicated as successful by a judge or jury if such patents were asserted against us.\nWe may receive in the future, particularly as a public company, communications from patent holders, including non-practicing entities, alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or misappropriation of trade secrets, or offering licenses to such intellectual property. Any claims that we assert against perceived infringers could also provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. We may also become involved in disputes with others regarding the ownership of intellectual property rights. For example, we jointly develop intellectual property with certain parties, and disagreements may therefore arise as to the ownership of the intellectual property developed pursuant to these relationships. If we are unable to resolve these disputes, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights.\nThe large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved and the uncertainty of litigation significantly increase the risks related to any patent litigation. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop selling, making, using, or exporting products that use the disputed intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling, making, exporting, or using products, which license may require substantial royalty payments and may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing, potentially including treble damages if the court finds that the infringement was willful;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third-party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products and services;\n\u2022\npay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\nfind non-infringing substitute products, which could be costly and create significant delay due to the need for prior FDA authorization;\n\u2022\nfind alternative supplies for infringing products or processes, which could be costly and create significant delay due to the need for FDA regulatory clearance; and/or\n\u2022\nredesign those products or processes that infringe any third-party intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive, and/or infeasible.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to intellectual property. For more information regarding our ongoing litigation with Boston Scientific, see the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d included under Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, that we do not control. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the value of the 2025 Notes. Additionally, because we often do not control the timing of the public announcements, there is the potential for these announcements to be made during market hours, necessitating a halt in the trading of our common stock for periods of time. Finally, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. Further, as the number of participants in the neuromodulation industry grows, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases.\nIn addition, we may indemnify our customers, suppliers and international distributors against claims relating to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties relating to our products, methods, and/or manufacturing processes. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers, suppliers, or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, suppliers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers, suppliers, or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products, or our suppliers may be forced to stop providing us with products.\nSimilarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO or any foreign patent authority may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome in these or any other such proceedings could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, if any license is offered at all.\nWe may also become involved in other proceedings, such as re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the USPTO or its foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. For example, two of our competitors, Boston Scientific and Medtronic, have filed oppositions in the EU with respect to certain of our patents. Boston Scientific has filed an entitlement action against us in the German courts. In addition, an anonymous petitioner has filed an opposition before the China National Intellectual Property Administration against one of our patents in China (which was dismissed, but for which the anonymous petitioner has filed an appeal). Defending our position in proceedings such as these will require management\u2019s time and attention, as well as financial costs. Given the competitive environment in which we operate, we expect additional\nchallenges to our intellectual property portfolio as we continue commercialization of Senza in the United States and abroad. An unfavorable outcome in these or any other such proceedings could cause us to lose valuable intellectual property rights and/or be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could invite increased competition thereby materially harming our business.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our existing and future products.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the Leahy-Smith Act) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and may affect patent litigation. The changes also switched the United States patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our patents and applications. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by United States and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. In addition, many of our executive officers and key employees have worked for our major competitors (or companies acquired by these competitors), which include Boston Scientific, Medtronic and Abbott Laboratories. Although we have procedures in place that seek to prevent our employees and consultants from using the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, or that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of a former employer or competitor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. For example, in April 2018, Boston Scientific filed such suit against us, claiming trade secret misappropriation. While we believe the Boston Scientific claim lacks merit, even if we are successful in defending against the Boston Scientific claim or any other such claims, litigation necessarily results in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to litigation claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, and may prevent us from selling our products or from practicing our processes. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or\nprevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nIn addition to patent and trademark protection, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our consultants and vendors, or our former or current employees. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, however, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our trade secrets and other unpatented or unregistered proprietary information, and once disclosed, we are likely to lose trade secret protection. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to enforce trade secret protection.\nFurther, our competitors may independently develop knowledge, methods and know-how similar, equivalent, or superior to our proprietary technology. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. In addition, our key employees, consultants, suppliers or other individuals with access to our proprietary technology and know-how may incorporate that technology and know-how into projects and inventions developed independently or with third parties. As a result, disputes may arise regarding the ownership of the proprietary rights to such technology or know-how, and any such dispute may not be resolved in our favor. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us and our competitive position could be adversely affected. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected so as to protect our market against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nRisks Related to our Financial and Operating Results\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may negatively impact our stock price in the future.\nOur quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to, among others, the following reasons:\n\u2022\neffects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including, among others, surges of cases related to new variants, suspensions of non-essential or elective procedures to reduce non-critical hospitalizations, reduced demand for elective procedures and delays in trials and permanent implants;\n\u2022\nphysician and payor acceptance of our products and 10 kHz Therapy;\n\u2022\nour success in initiating patient trials for the 10 kHz Therapy and converting those trials into permanent implants;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and grow the SCS market by convincing physicians and patients to use our therapy to treat PDN and NSRBP, and convincing payors to cover such procedures;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of the development of new markets for SCS, including PDN and NSRBP;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our expenses associated with inventory buildup or write-downs from analyzing our inventory for obsolescence or conformity with our product requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the average sales prices of our products, in particular due to pricing pressure from competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the expenses related to initiating, pursuing and defending lawsuits;\n\u2022\nbuying patterns of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing, expense and results of our commercialization efforts in the United States and elsewhere, R&D activities, clinical studies and regulatory approvals or certifications;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe productivity of our sales representatives;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting receivables related to our sales in the United States;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in expenses as a result of expanding our commercial operations and operating as a public company;\n\u2022\nsupplier, manufacturing or quality problems with our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or strategies or in the pricing policies or strategies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in coverage amounts or government and third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies; and\n\u2022\nmarket volatility impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nBecause of these and other factors, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet investor expectations or those of public market analysts.\nAny unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate. New information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our business, which could cause a decline in our stock price.\nWe may choose, or need, to obtain additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, and we anticipate our expenses will increase as we continue to build a commercial sales force in the United States, including for our recently\napproved indications of PDN and NSRBP, investigate the use of our 10 kHz Therapy for the treatment of other chronic pain conditions, continue to otherwise grow our business, including potentially acquiring other businesses or technologies, manage the maturity of the 2025 Notes, and continue to operate as a public company. In particular, we believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future on the commercialization of Senza in the United States, as well as the growth of our sales and marketing efforts and sales representative training, seeking additional foreign regulatory approvals or certifications, the preparation and submission of regulatory filings and the clinical development of any other product candidates or indications we may choose to pursue. These expenditures will also include costs associated with manufacturing and supply as well as marketing and selling Senza in the United States and elsewhere, and any other future products approved for sale, R&D, conducting preclinical studies and clinical studies and obtaining regulatory approvals or certifications.\nWe believe that our growth will depend, in part, on our ability to fund our commercialization efforts, particularly in the United States, and our efforts to develop our Senza systems and 10 kHz Therapy for the treatment of additional chronic pain indications and develop technology complementary to our current product. In order to further enhance our R&D efforts, pursue product expansion opportunities or acquire a new business or products that are complementary to our business, we may choose to seek additional funds. If we are unable to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, the long-term growth of our business may be negatively impacted. As a result, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe costs of commercializing our products in the United States and elsewhere, including costs associated with product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the average sales price of our products, in particular if we face pricing pressure from competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including, in particular, the costs of enforcing our patent rights in the action we filed against Boston Scientific and in defending against Boston Scientific\u2019s action against us;\n\u2022\nthe R&D activities we intend to undertake in order to expand the chronic pain indications and product enhancements that we intend to pursue;\n\u2022\nwhether or not we pursue acquisitions or investments in businesses, products or technologies that are complementary to our current business;\n\u2022\nthe degree and rate of market acceptance of our products in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nchanges or fluctuations in our inventory supply needs and forecasts of our supply needs;\n\u2022\nour need to implement additional infrastructure and internal systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire additional personnel to support our operations as a public company; and\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.\nTo finance these activities, we may seek funds through borrowings or through additional rounds of financing, including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners. We may be unable to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we borrow additional funds or issue debt securities, these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock and the 2025 Notes, and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations. We might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, product candidates, or products that we otherwise would not relinquish. If we do not obtain additional resources, our ability to capitalize on business opportunities will be limited, we may be unable to compete effectively and the growth of our business will be harmed.\nWe are required to maintain high levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources, reduce our cash flows and lead to inventory impairment charges.\nAs a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory, we are subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence and expiration, which may lead to inventory impairment charges. Our products consist of a substantial number of individual components. In order to market and sell Senza effectively, we often must maintain high levels of inventory. In particular, as we continue to market and sell Senza in the United States, we intend to maintain our high levels of inventory in order to meet our estimated demand and, as a result, incur significant expenditures associated with such levels of inventory. The manufacturing process requires lengthy lead times, during which components of our products may become obsolete, and we may over- or underestimate the amount needed of a given component, in which case we may expend extra resources or be constrained in the amount of end product that we can produce. As compared to direct manufacturers, our dependence on third-party manufacturers exposes us to greater lead times increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence comparatively, and we would be required to record an impairment charge, as we did in the first quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. Furthermore, our products have a limited shelf life due to sterilization requirements, and part or all of a given product or component may expire and its value would become impaired. We have also experienced inventory write-downs as a result of inventory that did not meet our product requirements. In addition, as we release later generations of products that contain advancements or additional features, the earlier generations may become obsolete. If our estimates of required inventory are too high, we may be exposed to further inventory obsolescence risk. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete or expires, or in the event we experience a supply chain imbalance as described above, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory.\nThe seasonality of our business creates variance in our quarterly revenue, which makes it difficult to compare or forecast our financial results.\nOur revenue fluctuates on a seasonal basis, which affects the comparability of our results between periods. For example, due to the seasonality of buying patterns and implant volumes of distributors, hospitals and clinics, the industry generally experiences lower revenues in the first and third quarters of the year and higher revenues in the fourth quarter. We have experienced these industry trends to a greater degree than in our initial U.S. commercial launch phase, although normal purchasing patterns have been disrupted since the COVID-19 pandemic. These seasonal variations are difficult to predict accurately, may vary amongst different markets, and at times may be entirely unpredictable, which introduce additional risk into our business as we rely upon forecasts of customer demand to build inventory in advance of anticipated sales.\nWe are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations.\nA portion of our business is located outside the United States and, as a result, we generate revenue and incur expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, a majority of which is denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Australian Dollars. As a result, changes in the exchange rates between such foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact the reporting of our receivables and payables in non-U.S. currencies. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock and the value of the 2025 Notes could be adversely affected.\nIn the future, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income and taxes may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and other tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to offset post-change taxable income and taxes.\nAs a result of our June 2015 underwritten public offering, we have experienced a Section 382 \u201cownership change.\u201d We currently believe that this \u201cownership change\u201d will not inhibit our ability to utilize our NOLs prior to expiration. However, we may experience additional ownership changes as a result of subsequent changes in our stock ownership, some of which changes may be outside our control. As a result, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs and tax credits, even if we achieve profitability and generate sufficient taxable income in the future. If we are limited in our ability to use our NOLs and tax credits in future years as a result of ownership changes, we will pay more taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our NOLs and tax credits. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal NOLs of $588.4 million, of which $329.4 million was generated in fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, which can be carried forward indefinitely under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act), as well as state NOLs of $336.5 million, of which $54.3 million may be carried forward indefinitely. If not utilized, the remaining federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2026 and the state NOLs will begin to expire in 2022.\nRisks Related to Regulation of our Industry\nSenza is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nThe medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies and authorities, such as the competent authorities of the EU member states. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies and authorities and notified bodies regulate and oversee, among other things, with respect to medical devices:\n\u2022\ndesign, development and manufacturing;\n\u2022\ntesting, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;\n\u2022\nclinical studies;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\nmarketing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022\npre-market regulatory clearance, approval and certification;\n\u2022\nconformity assessment procedures;\n\u2022\nrecord-keeping procedures;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u2022\nrecalls and other field safety corrective actions;\n\u2022\npost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u2022\npost-market studies; and\n\u2022\nproduct import and export.\nThe laws and regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Legislative or regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. federal and state regulations or other foreign regulations applicable in the countries where we operate could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory clearance, approvals or certifications, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. In the most extreme cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible. If any of these risks materialize, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to expand the potential indications for which Senza is approved or certified or introduce new or improved products.\nOur products must comply with regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA in the United States and similar agencies or bodies in foreign jurisdictions. These requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities, extensive agency review processes or notified bodies review processes, and other costly and time-consuming procedures. It often takes several years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. We also are subject to numerous additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. Some of the most important requirements we must comply with include:\n\u2022\nFFDCA and the FDA\u2019s implementing regulations (Title 21 CFR);\n\u2022\nEU legislation on medical devices;\n\u2022\nMedical Device Quality Management System Requirements (ISO 13485:2016);\n\u2022\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration requirements; and\n\u2022\nCalifornia Department of Health Services requirements.\nGovernment regulation may impede our ability to conduct clinical studies and to manufacture and sell our existing and future products. Government regulation also could delay our marketing of new products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. Foreign regulatory agencies or notified bodies may not approve or certify Senza and any of our future products on a timely basis, if at all. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, such approvals or certifications could negatively impact our marketing of any future products and reduce our product revenues.\nOur products remain subject to strict regulatory controls on manufacturing, marketing and use. We may be forced to modify or recall a product after release in response to regulatory action or unanticipated difficulties encountered in general use. Any such action could have a material effect on the reputation of our products and on our business and financial position.\nFurther, regulations may change, and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies, which could harm our business. We could also be subject to new international, federal, state or local regulations that could affect our R&D programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways. If this happens, we may have to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations, which will harm our results of operations.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, the results of the 2020 Presidential election may impact our business and industry. Namely, the previous presidential administration took several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict whether or how these Executive Orders will be implemented, or whether they will be rescinded and replaced under the Biden administration. The policies and priorities of an incoming presidential administration are unknown and could materially impact the regulations governing our products.\nFor instance, the EU landscape concerning medical devices recently evolved. On May 25, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation entered into force, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them) in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive or EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance requirements.\nNon-compliance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation may affect our business or the way we intend to conduct our business in the EU.\nThe aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA. Non-compliance with the above requirements would also prevent us from selling our products in these three countries.\nSenza is subject to extensive governmental regulation in foreign jurisdictions, such as Europe, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nSubject to the transitional provisions and in order to sell our products in EU member states, our products must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces EU Medical Devices Directive and the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the European Conformity (CE) mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. All medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and - where applicable - other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility, metrology or reuse aspects), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be unable to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the EU.\nFollowing a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom (UK), the UK formally withdrew from the EU and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its relationship with the EU. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) was applied provisionally as of January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021. The TCA does not specifically refer to medical devices. However, as a result of Brexit, the EU Medical Devices Regulation will not be implemented in the UK, and previous legislation that sought to mirror the EU Medical Devices Regulation in the UK law has been revoked. The regulatory regime for medical devices in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) continues to be based on the requirements derived from previous EU legislation, and the UK may choose to retain regulatory flexibility or align with the EU Medical Devices Regulation going forward. CE markings will continue to be recognized in the UK, and certificates issued by EU-recognized notified bodies will be valid in the UK, until June 30, 2023. For medical\ndevices placed on the market in Great Britain after this period, the UK Conformity Assessed (UCKA) marking will be mandatory. In contrast, UKCA marking and certificates issued by UK notified bodies will not be recognized on the EU market. Additionally, UK-based notified bodies, which were designated to independently assess the conformity of certain products requiring CE marking before being placed on the EU market, are no longer established in the EU, and accordingly, the conformity assessments carried out by such UK notified bodies, including those assessments carried out prior to 1 January 2021, are no longer valid for the EU compliance regime. Manufacturers whose products currently rely on third-party conformity assessments carried out by UK notified bodies require new conformity assessments to be carried out by EU-based notified bodies in order to ensure continuing compliance with the EU regime and to continue to place those products on the EU market. The TCA does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls (or other similar actions). For medical devices that are locally manufactured but use components from other countries, the \u201crules of origin\u201d criteria will need to be reviewed. Depending on which countries products will be ultimately sold in, manufacturers may start seeking alternative sources for components if this would allow them to benefit from no tariffs. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in Great Britain.\nIn order to continue to sell Senza in Europe, we must maintain our certification and continue to comply with EU legislation and also the UK legislation. Our failure to continue to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including those administered by authorities of the EU member states or the MHRA, could result in enforcement actions against us, including refusal, suspension or withdrawal of our certificates issued by our notified bodies, which could impair our ability to market products in the Europe in the future.\nIn addition, we are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes obligations on companies that operate in our industry with respect to the processing of personal data of individuals within the EEA and the cross-border transfer of such data. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. If our or our partners\u2019 or service providers\u2019 privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as compensation claims by affected individuals, negative publicity, reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill. Data privacy laws in the EU are developing rapidly and, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into the UK national law, with each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of \u20ac20 million/ \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term. These changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the United Kingdom, enabling data transfers from member states in the EU to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards. However, the United Kingdom adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission renews or extends that decision and remains under review by the Commission during this period.\nIn the EU, according to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. We are also subject to Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU member state legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. EU member state legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our ability to advertise our products directly to the general public. In addition, voluntary EU and national Codes of Conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.\nThe aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA. Non-compliance with the above requirements would also affect our business in these three countries.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our product may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business, or result in costly investigations and sanctions from the FDA and other regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion.\nSenza has been approved for marketing in the United States, certified in the EU and approved by the TGA in Australia for specific treatments and anatomies. We may only promote or market the Senza SCS system for its specifically approved indications as described on the approved label. We train our marketing and sales force against promoting our products for uses outside of the approved indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our product off-label, when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgement he or she deems the use of the product in the non-approved indication as appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our product off-label. Furthermore, the use of our product for indications other than those approved or certified by the applicable regulatory authority or notified body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nPhysicians may also misuse our product or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our product is misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. In addition, if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities determines that our promotional materials, training or physician support activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training, promotional materials or physician support activities or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment of our operations. Further, regulators or legislators may also enhance the enforcement of, and attempt to curtail, any off-label use by physicians of medical devices in the future. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nOur products may in the future be subject to notifications, recalls, or voluntary market withdrawals that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA, competent authorities of the EU member states and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could affect patient safety. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, conduct a product notification or recall to inform physicians of changes to instructions for use, or if a deficiency in a device is found or suspected. A government-mandated recall or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other issues. Recalls, which include certain notifications and corrections as well as removals, of Senza could divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, harm our reputation with customers, and reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue.\nIn addition, the manufacturing of our products is subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, and any failure by us or our contract manufacturers or suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements could result in recalls, facility closures, and other penalties. We and our suppliers and contract manufacturers are subject to the Quality System Regulation (QSR), and comparable foreign regulations which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping, and servicing of medical devices. These regulations are enforced through periodic inspections or audits of manufacturing facilities. Any manufacturing issues at our or our suppliers\u2019 or contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, including failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in warning or untitled letters, manufacturing restrictions, voluntary or mandatory recalls or corrections, fines,\nwithdrawals of regulatory clearances, approvals or certifications, product seizures, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, which would adversely affect our business results and prospects.\nWe are required to report certain malfunctions, deaths, and serious injuries associated with our products, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the FDA when they receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may have a malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU are legally bound to report serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs) involving devices they produce or sell to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred.\nMalfunction of our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls, including corrections, or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement actions. If malfunctions do occur, we may be unable to correct the malfunctions adequately or prevent further malfunctions, in which case we may need to cease manufacture and distribution of the affected products, initiate voluntary recalls, and redesign the products. Regulatory authorities may also take actions against us, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing the affected products. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nA recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities such as the relevant authorities of the EU member states have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nWe may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare and data privacy and security laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal, state and foreign governments, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information, including health-related information, which could significantly impact our business. In the United States, the laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to\npay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters submitted for payment. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA; and\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information that could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g. Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020, creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. The CCPA and the CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Similar laws have been passed in Virginia and Colorado and proposed at the federal level and in other states. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and\ndata protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues, which may affect our business and is expected to increase our compliance costs and exposure to liability. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which included, among other things, comparative effectiveness research initiatives and payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots and other provisions. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA or our business. Any new limitations on, changes to, or uncertainty with respect to the ability of individuals to enroll in governmental reimbursement programs or other third-party payor insurance plans could impact demand for our product.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, was signed into law which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including hospitals. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (MACRA), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians\u2019 participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures.\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop, receive regulatory clearance, approval or certification for, additional chronic pain indications for Senza and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market in a timely manner.\nIt is important to our business that we build a pipeline of product offerings for treatment of chronic pain. As such, our success will depend in part on our ability to expand the chronic pain indications for which our products may be used and/or develop and introduce new products. However, we may not be able to successfully develop and obtain regulatory clearance, approval or certification for expanded indications or product enhancements, or new products, or these products may not be accepted by physicians or the payors who financially support many of the procedures performed with our products.\nThe success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify and anticipate physician and patient needs properly;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\navoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical and clinical studies;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances, approvals or certifications for new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022\ncomply fully with FDA and foreign regulations on marketing of new devices or modified products;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training to potential users of our products; and\n\u2022\nreceive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our products.\nIf we do not develop new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, or if our competitors introduce new products with functionalities that are superior to ours, our results of operations will suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur stock price has experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. As a result, our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid and such volatility may also adversely impact the value of the 2025 Notes.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report and others such as:\n\u2022\nachievement of expected product sales and profitability, including the effects of seasonality on our results of operations, as well as adjustments to our sales forecasts;\n\u2022\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, see \u201c-Risks Related to our Business-Our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth could be harmed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d;\n\u2022\ndelays or setbacks in the commercialization of Senza or the expansion of indications for which Senza is approved;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements or developments in any intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become involved, including our lawsuits with Boston Scientific;\n\u2022\nmanufacture, supply or distribution shortages;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our expenses associated with inventory buildup or write-downs from analyzing our inventory for obsolescence or conformity with our product requirements;\n\u2022\nadverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nour operating results;\n\u2022\nresults from, or any delays in, clinical trial programs relating to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges or developments in laws or regulations applicable to our products;\n\u2022\nany adverse changes in our relationship with any manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe success of our efforts to acquire or develop additional products;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors or the medical device industry in general;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry or other healthcare reform measures in the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, as well as publications from research analysts associated with short selling;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\ntrading activity in our common stock by the option counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions to unwind or modify their hedge positions;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the United States equity markets, including as a result of volatility related to the recent coronavirus outbreak and related health concerns; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of any of our key management personnel.\nBecause the 2025 Notes are convertible into shares of common stock, volatility or depressed market prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the value of the 2025 Notes. Holders who receive shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2025 Notes will also be subject to the risk of volatility and depressed market prices of our common stock. Similarly, the liquidity of the trading market in the 2025 Notes, and the market price quoted for the 2025 Notes, may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for medical device stocks in particular, have experienced volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock and the value of the 2025 Notes. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business, which could seriously harm our financial position. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2025 Notes, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the 2025 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our\ndebt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nRegulatory actions and other events may adversely affect the value and liquidity of the 2025 Notes.\nWe expect that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, the 2025 Notes will employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the 2025 Notes. Investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the 2025 Notes. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the common stock.\nThe SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions, and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions, that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities (including our common stock). Such rules and actions include Rule 201 of SEC Regulation SHO, the adoption by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, and the national securities exchanges of a \u201cLimit Up-Limit Down\u201d program, the imposition of market-wide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines, and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Any governmental or regulatory action that restricts the ability of investors in, or potential purchasers of, the notes to effect short sales of our common stock, borrow our common stock or enter into swaps on our common stock could adversely affect the trading price and the liquidity of the 2025 Notes.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in any debt instruments we may have, some of which debt may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the 2025 Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the 2025 Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on these notes when due.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock and the value of the 2025 Notes could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. Further, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our internal control over financial reporting be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nIf we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. The process of designing and implementing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time consuming, costly and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock and the value of the 2025 Notes could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2025 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 2025 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2025 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2025 Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the 2025 Notes to their face amount over the respective terms of the 2025 Notes. We will report lower net income (or larger net losses) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the 2025 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2025 Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the respective conversion values of the 2025 Notes exceeds their respective principal amounts. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued a new standard that proposes to change the accounting for the convertible debt instruments described above. Under the new standard, an entity may no longer be required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. This could have the impact of reducing non-cash interest expense, and thereby increasing net income (or decreasing net losses). Additionally, the treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Rather, the if-converted method may be required, which could decrease our diluted earnings per share. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within that year, with early adoption permitted, and can either be adopted on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price and the value of the 2025 Notes may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price and the value of the 2025 Notes may decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price and the value of the 2025 Notes to fall.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, upon the vesting of restricted stock units, upon conversion of the 2025 Notes, upon exercise of the warrants in the warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes and 2025 Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock and the value of the 2025 Notes could decline. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding a total of approximately 35.0 million shares of common stock, and approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules, and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock and the value of the 2025 Notes could decline.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022\nwe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful;\n\u2022\nwe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;\n\u2022\nwe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;\n\u2022\nwe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification;\n\u2022\nthe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and\n\u2022\nwe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, our stockholders are not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, our stockholders\u2019 ability to receive a return on their investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased it.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in tax laws, tax rulings or trade policies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws and policy relating to taxes or trade may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Recently enacted legislation and associated regulations have significantly changed U.S. federal income tax laws, with potential impact to state and local taxation. Further, many countries in Europe have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that may increase our tax obligations in those countries.\nIn addition, changes in U.S. trade policies could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure, and those of our third-party service providers, against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, marketing, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, attacks by computer hackers, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology and telephone systems, if our systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and\npatent applications covering our products or procedures, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our own, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and the breadth of patent claims allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories in which we have patent protection that may not be sufficient to terminate infringing activities.\nWe do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist. Moreover, in foreign jurisdictions where we do have patent rights, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, such proceedings could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and if we do prevail, the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our products, and our competitive position in the international market would be harmed.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition with potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. In addition, third parties have registered trademarks similar and identical to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, and may in the future file for registration of such trademarks. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we were not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products in those countries. In any case, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issues an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, a research analyst associated with short selling activity published a report that resulted in short term volatility in our stock. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NYSE, including the\nestablishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nIn addition, our management and other personnel divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur in order to remain compliant with our public company reporting requirements or the timing of such costs. Additional compensation costs and any future equity awards will increase our compensation expense, which would increase our general and administrative expense and could adversely affect our profitability.", "PERMNO": 15046, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "NVRO"}
