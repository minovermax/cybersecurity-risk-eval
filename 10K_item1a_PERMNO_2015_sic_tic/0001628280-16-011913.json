Risk Factors.\nIn the ordinary course of operating our business, we are exposed to a variety of risks inherent to the financial services industry. The following discusses the significant risk factors that could affect our business and operations. If any of the following conditions or events actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your investment in the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment in the Company\u2019s common stock.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates, and the degree to which these changes disparately impact short-term and long-term interest rates. Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets.\nUntil recently, the Federal Reserve Board had maintained interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate. If the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s recent action to start increasing short-term rates does not result in an increase in long-term rates, we may experience a flattening or inverted yield curve that would negatively impact our net interest margin and earnings.\nFurther, if rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than any changes in interest rates earned on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income. In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds into higher yielding accounts. Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments. In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 2.5% or $6.2 million.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2015, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $964.5 million. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe are also subject to prepayment and reinvestment risk related to interest rate movements. Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in the prepayment or refinancing of loans and loans underlying mortgage related securities, resulting in accelerated cash flows subject to reinvestment at reduced market interest rates and increased premium amortization. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that such prepayments cannot be reinvested at a profitable spread in excess of our funding costs. Increases in interest rates can result in reduced prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities, as borrowers retain existing loans to maintain lower borrowing costs.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including loan originations and commitments, withdrawals by depositors, repayments of borrowings, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; the sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors specific to us or the financial services industry in general. Factors detrimental to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Recent regulations implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have made retail deposits in transaction accounts more attractive to banks with assets greater than $50 billion, which pressures will likely continue to increase the competition we face to retain these deposits. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews and credit risk ratings, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nOur emphasis on the diversification of our loan portfolio through the origination of commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and construction loans has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses. In the event we were to further increase the amount of such types of loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make additional or increased provisions for loans losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA downturn in the housing sector and related markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur lending business and investments in mortgage-backed securities are tied in large part to the housing market. Lower home prices, a heightened level of foreclosures, or a protracted foreclosure process would adversely impact the credit performance of real estate related loans and collateral values. These conditions could potentially cause a reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses. Such negative economic conditions could adversely impact our prospects for growth, asset and goodwill valuations, and could result in a decrease in our interest income and a material increase in our provision for loan losses.\nA general economic slowdown or uncertainty that produces either reduced returns or excessive market volatility could adversely impact our wealth management fee income.\nA general economic slowdown could affect the value of the assets under management in our wealth management business resulting in lower fee income. Furthermore, conditions that produce extended market volatility could affect our ability to provide our customers with an adequate return, thereby causing them to seek more stable investment opportunities with alternative wealth advisors.\nOur commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial loans expose us to increased lending risks.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and, to a lesser extent, construction loans. These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property. In addition, our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans, multi-family loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans. Also, many of our borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.\nOur continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.\nOur success is significantly affected by general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, and with the acquisition of Team Capital Bank in 2014, eastern Pennsylvania. Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers mostly located in our primary markets. Consequently, a downturn in economic conditions in our local markets would have a significant impact on our loan portfolios, the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans. Adverse local economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. Additionally, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, depressed real estate values and real estate sales may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.\nWe target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRisks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.\nWe have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processers, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers\u2019 transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.\nThe occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to\nlitigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.\nWe operate in diverse market segments and rely on the ability of our employees, systems and third party providers, who are used extensively in support of our operations, to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, the occurrence of systems failures and disruptions, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. While we maintain a risk management program that is designed to minimize risk, we could suffer losses, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to stockholders, the classification of our assets, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, and our management of risks posed by our reliance on third party vendors. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on our operations.\nThe potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders. Actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not have the beneficial effects that are intended. In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nFinancial reform legislation could substantially increase our compliance burden and costs and necessitate changes in the conduct of our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is having a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes. Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act are being implemented over time. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear and may not be known for many years. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. In particular, the following provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, among others, are impacting our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively:\n\u2022imposition of comprehensive, new consumer protection requirements, which could substantially increase our compliance burden and potentially expose us to new liabilities;\n\u2022application of regulatory capital requirements to the Company; and\n\u2022changes in methodologies for calculating deposit insurance premiums and increases in required deposit insurance fund reserve levels, which could increase our deposit insurance expense.\nBanks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to additional requirements imposed by the Dodd Frank Act and its implementing regulations such as the imposition of higher FDIC premiums, reduced debit card interchange fees, enhanced risk management frameworks and stress testing, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings. As we approach $10 billion in assets, we will be required to incur additional costs to address these imposed requirements.\nFurther, we may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and continue to make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Failure to comply with\nthe new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted proposals that have substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The amendments implemented the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The new rules apply regulatory capital requirements to both the Bank and the consolidated Company. The amended rules included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective in January 2015, with certain requirements to be phased in beginning in 2016, and refined the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating those ratios.\nThe new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bank and the Company include: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The amended rules also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nThe Basel III changes and other regulatory capital requirements will result in generally higher regulatory capital standards. The application of more stringent capital requirements to the Bank and the consolidated Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could further limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, investment advisers, wealth managers, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. In particular, over the past decade, our local markets have experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly. There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors in our market. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain deposit and loan pricing, services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.\nActs of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nOur business is subject to risk from external events. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems. The metropolitan New York and Northern New Jersey areas remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism, which could affect not only our operations but those of our customers. Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage, cause disruption of power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future. If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings could decline.\nWe record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value. At December 31, 2015, goodwill totaling $411.6 million was not amortized but remains subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a potential\ninability to realize the carrying amount. The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.\nA company has the option to qualitatively determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before proceeding with a two step quantitative impairment analysis. If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the quantitative impairment analysis and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed. The second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value.\nFair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors. Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame. Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.\nIt is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets, or both. If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and other identified intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.", "PERMNO": 89653, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "PFS"}
