{"cik": "1452575", "company": "Mead Johnson Nutrition Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results, which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline.\nRisk Factors Related to the Merger\nThe Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nOn February 10, 2017 we entered into the Merger Agreement with Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser. The Merger Agreement is an executory contract subject to closing conditions beyond our control, and there is no guarantee that these conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Completion of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including approval of the Merger by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, approval of the Merger by an affirmative vote of a simple majority of Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s shareholders and the receipt of required antitrust approvals, among other things. If any of the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied (or waived by the other party), the Merger may not be completed. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of our board of directors or our termination of the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement).\nFailure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nIf the Merger is not completed, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire the Company at a price of $90 per share or higher, on terms acceptable to us, our stock price will likely decline as our stock has recently traded at prices based on the proposed per share consideration for the Merger.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger.\n\u2022\nA failed Merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community.\n\u2022\nUpon termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company or Reckitt Benckiser under specified circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $480 million.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage or make it difficult for a third party to acquire us prior to the completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to entertain a third party proposal to acquire us. These provisions include the general prohibition on our soliciting or engaging in discussions or negotiations regarding any alternative acquisition proposal, subject to certain exceptions. We are also required to pay a termination fee of $480 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, including if we enter into a definitive agreement for a superior proposal. These provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an acquisition transaction, even one that may be deemed of greater value than the Merger to our stockholders. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, the requirement on our part to pay a termination fee may result in that third party offering a lower value to our stockholders than such third party might otherwise have offered.\nThe announcement of the Merger could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results and operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results and operations, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These risks to our business include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of significant management time and resources towards the completion of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, including our senior management;\n\u2022\ndifficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners;\n\u2022\nthe inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business because of requirements in the Merger Agreement that we conduct our business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the completion of the Merger; and\n\u2022\nlitigation relating to the Merger and the costs related thereto.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe operate in an intensely competitive business where many factors, including competitive price-based promotional activity, may impact demand for our products.\nOur primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. They have diversified product portfolios and may benefit from greater economies of scale due to their size and global footprint. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices. We compete based on the following factors: innovation and nutrition science; brand recognition and loyalty; product quality; effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences; price; distribution and availability of products. Continued price-based promotional activity has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, revenues and demand for our products. Competitive pressures may lead us to reduce product prices. Such pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity, wage and other cost increases. If we are unable to compete effectively, our financial condition and operating results may suffer.\nOur China operations are subject to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations in China. Consequently, our overall financial results are dependent on this market and our business is exposed to significant risks, particularly with regard to China\u2019s evolving regulatory landscape as it applies to our business. Our success may be adversely affected by the need to adjust our product manufacturing, distribution, labeling and marketing to comply with China\u2019s evolving laws and regulations, including those related to trade restrictions, product quality requirements, product labeling rules, advertising regulations and limitations on the number of brands and formulations manufactured in one location. Risks associated with our China operations also include changes in economic conditions (including potential slowdowns in China\u2019s economy, wage and cost inflation, currency exchange rates, consumer spending and employment levels), changes in tax rates, potential tariffs, duties and other trade barriers and increased competitive promotional activity. Moreover, our success in China depends on our ability to predict, identify, interpret and react to changes in consumer product and sales channel preferences. The shift in consumer demand towards fully imported products and the increased interest in premium-priced products has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, demand for our locally manufactured products.\nMoreover, as consumer demand for fully imported products evolves and we expand direct shipments of such products into the region, ongoing sales channel shifts have, and may continue to, negatively impact our Hong Kong sales. Our Hong Kong sales have traditionally been weighted towards retail sales to non-local consumers from mainland China. Due to regulations, political factors and a decrease in visitors from mainland China, we have experienced a decline in traditional retail sales. This trend has been exacerbated by consumer demand for fully imported products through e-commerce channels. While we have begun to transition to fast growing online sales channels, we have, and may continue to, experience lower than expected sales from Hong Kong to mainland China customers. There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such risks and uncertainties on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations. Changes in governmental regulations or other policies could harm our business.\nAs an infant nutrition company, our business is subject to extensive government regulation with respect to product manufacturing and labeling, the environment, employee health and safety, hygiene, quality control, advertising, marketing, privacy and tax laws. It can be costly to comply with these regulations. Global regulatory provisions that govern our ability to bring innovative formulas to market have become increasingly stringent with regard to requirements for scientific substantiation for innovation. Similarly, regulatory criteria with respect to safety and quality requirements have become increasingly stringent. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to sales bans, product recalls, lawsuits, administrative penalties and other remedies. In addition, changes in laws or regulations could further restrict our actions and significantly increase our cost of doing business, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. For example, government regulations impacting how and where we manufacture or source product may cause unfavorable cost outlay, pricing pressure, a significant change in our offerings or geographic earnings mix and/or an adverse effect on the related global tax liability. See also \u201cOur China operations are subject to risks that could negatively affect our business.\u201d Barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade may limit our cross-border activities and sales. Governmental pricing actions may limit our ability to increase, or force us to reduce, prices in various jurisdictions throughout the world. Moreover, regulations that restrict marketing, promotion, availability and sale of our products, interactions with health care professionals, product content (including the regulations related to genetically modified organisms), as well as the manufacture, labeling and intellectual property rights for our products, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may experience liabilities or negative effects on our reputation as a result of real or perceived quality issues, including product recalls, injuries or other claims.\nWe may be subject to liability if our products or operations violate, or are alleged to violate, applicable laws or regulations or in the event our products cause, or are alleged to cause, injury, illness or death. Powdered infant formula and powdered milk products are not sterile. A risk of contamination or adulteration exists at each stage of the production cycle, including the purchase and incorporation of raw food materials/ingredients into the final product, the processing and packaging steps in making the product and upon handling and use by health care professionals, hospital personnel and consumers. In the event that our products are found, or are alleged, to have suffered contamination or adulteration, whether or not such products were under our control, our brand reputation and business could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, whether real or perceived, contamination or spoilage, product mislabeling or product tampering could result in product recalls. No such recalls have been material to our global business. However, a future product recall could be material and have a negative impact on our sales and profitability.\nWhether real or perceived, reports of inadequate quality control (with respect to either our products or those of other manufacturers in our segment) could adversely impact our business by contributing to a perceived safety risk throughout the industry. The risk of reputational harm is magnified through rapid, digital dissemination of information through news reports, social media or otherwise. Federal, state and local governments and municipalities could also propose or pass legislation banning the use of our products.\nOur business is subject to anti-infant formula policies and legislation in various jurisdictions, many of which may impact our operations and effectiveness.\nCertain advocates and governmental and non-governmental organizations (particularly in Hong Kong, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia and Singapore) have advocated for heightened restrictions on the marketing, labeling and even the sale of some pediatric nutrition products as well as trademark restrictions, restrictions on interactions with health care providers and bans on claims for products covering children up to three years of age, including the \u201cGuidance on Ending the Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young Children\u201d that was published by the WHO in 2016. We and other industry participants were unable to persuade the WHO to modify its guidance to recognize the scientifically proven benefits of infant formula products. The WHO guidance is now under consideration for potential legislation in several countries where we market our products. Because our success depends, in large part, on our ability to define the benefits of our products, to effectively communicate our science-based benefits and to connect with our consumers, any such restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and market share.\nOur significant international operations are subject to extensive risk.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, 72% of our net sales were generated outside of the United States. Our significant international operations are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could materially harm our business. These risks include:\n\u2022\nmultiple regulatory requirements that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market or sell our products;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncompliance with anti-corruption regulations;\n\u2022\ndiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\nprograms and policies intended to discourage the use of our products;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and exchange controls;\n\u2022\nprice controls;\n\u2022\nunauthorized sales of our products through parallel markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs; and\n\u2022\ndiminished protection of intellectual property.\nOur operations and financial results face significant foreign currency exchange exposure.\nOur financial performance measured on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A substantial portion of our sales are outside of the U.S. and the U.S. dollar has recently been strengthening in relation to many relevant currencies. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations, particularly as the U.S. dollar strengthens or does so at an accelerated pace. While we attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities, our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency impacts on our financial statements. Currency rates in some markets could impact our results due to high exchange rate volatility, potentially or actually requiring us to apply inflationary accounting. For example, our business in Argentina may be subject to hyperinflationary accounting in the future, the impact of which on our consolidated financial statements is dependent upon movements in the exchange rate, including devaluations. Operating in high inflationary environments could subject us to additional government actions, devaluations and other business restrictions (see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d).\nMoreover, foreign governments may restrict our ability to exchange local currencies for more marketable currencies and may limit our ability to pay dividends, to pay non-local currency accounts payable or to obtain currencies (other than the local currency) which may be more desirable to hold. Foreign governments may simultaneously restrict our ability to increase prices in inflationary environments where local currencies are under significant pressure. Without the ability to increase prices to offset the impact of local currency devaluation, our ability to manage foreign exchange risk may be further limited.\nEconomic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase premium brand pediatric nutrition products (and, in particular, premium-priced products) depends in part on local economic conditions. For example, consumers may shift their purchases from our higher-priced premium products to lower-priced products or delay having children. During economic downturns, a decrease in the number of working mothers could constrict our customer base, further reducing our sales.\nCommodity price increases raise our operating costs and may reduce our profitability.\nOur business is particularly vulnerable to commodity price increases in the cost of raw materials used to make our products (such as skim milk powder, whole milk powder, lactose and whey protein concentrate), the cost of inputs used to manufacture and ship our products (such as crude oil and energy) and the amount we pay to produce or purchase packaging for our products. Commodity price volatility is caused by conditions such as fluctuating commodities markets, currency fluctuations, availability of supply, weather, consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Dairy costs are the largest component of our cost of goods sold. Increases in commodity costs generally impact our gross margins if we are unable to offset such increases by raising prices, changing our product mix or other efforts. Price increases, in turn, could weaken demand for our product. We monitor our exposure to commodity prices as part of our risk management program and attempt to mitigate risk with commodity hedging activities or contractual agreements; however, continued commodity price volatility and ineffective commodity risk management could lead to lower profitability.\nOur business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities.\nWe manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale; therefore, we are subject to risks inherent in these activities such as:\n\u2022\nraw material, product quality or safety issues, and related shortages or recalls by either us or our third-party suppliers;\n\u2022\nsupply chain disruptions due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, strikes, various contagious diseases, changes in government regulations or other factors over which we have no control;\n\u2022\nloss or impairment of key global manufacturing sites or a failure to maintain compliant manufacturing practices at either our sites or third-party manufacturing sites;\n\u2022\nlimits on production and manufacturing capabilities due to physical capacity limitations, regulatory requirements, or export / import restrictions associated with the transport of raw goods or material;\n\u2022\nsignificant difficulties with the highly exacting and complex processes required to manufacture our products, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and the related need to discard product batches; and\n\u2022\nstrikes, labor disputes, industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues.\nReduced manufacturing capacity without adequate redundancy could result in an inability to meet market demand and lost market share. While we have business continuity plans in place for certain manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption in global manufacturing and sourcing activities for any of the above reasons could interrupt our business and lead to increased costs, lost sales, reputational damage and expense. If not remedied, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, such significant disruptions may limit our ability to introduce and distribute products, including our existing pipeline of new or improved products, or otherwise take advantage of opportunities in new and existing markets.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services in connection with the manufacturing and distribution of our products.\nUnaffiliated third-party suppliers provide us with materials necessary for commercial production of our products, including certain key raw materials and primary packaging materials. We may be unable to manufacture our products in a timely manner, or at all, if any of our third-party suppliers should cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply us, or if the supply agreements are suspended, terminated or otherwise expire without renewal, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. We also use third-party distributors in many countries throughout the world, including in developing countries. We could experience disruptions that lead to a loss of sales or claims against the Company and irreparable damage to our reputation if any of our third-party distributors either fail to deliver on their commitments in a timely manner or at all (whether due to financial instability, non-compliance with applicable regulations, disruptions in local infrastructure or otherwise) or purport to represent the Company in an unauthorized manner. While we utilize a third-party due diligence process, in light of our global distributor network and the related risks of doing business in developing countries, it is possible that our due diligence process may not successfully identify all relevant risks. See also \u201cOur global operations are subject to political and economic risks of developing countries, and risks associated with doing business in developing markets.\u201d Moreover, if our distribution agreements are suspended, terminated or otherwise expire without renewal, our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology. Increased IT security threats could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data integrity.\nWe rely on our information technology, administrative and outsourcing systems (including cloud or partner systems and third-party providers) to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. We also rely on such systems to protect employee and, at times, customer data, including personally identifiable information, which we may collect and retain. These systems may be susceptible to damage or interruption due to system failures, computer viruses, security breaches, telecommunication failures, user error, catastrophic events or other factors. If our information technology, administrative and outsourcing systems suffer severe damage or interruption or intrusion, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issue in a timely manner, our business could suffer as we could experience business disruption, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, a loss of customer or employee data and a loss of sales or customers. Moreover, increasing global security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We invest in training and security technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches that could adversely affect our business. Such threats, if they materialize, could compromise confidential information or lead to the improper use of our systems and networks, the manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. If we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of confidential information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage.\nOur growth depends on certain demographic trends as well as scientific opinion regarding our products.\nOur growth plan relies on favorable demographic trends in various markets, including birth rates, rising incomes in emerging markets, increasing number of working mothers and increasing consumer global awareness of the importance of pediatric nutrition. If any of these demographic trends change in an adverse way (due to macroeconomic factors, epidemics such as the Zika virus or other factors beyond our control), our business could be materially impacted. In addition, an adverse change in scientific opinion regarding our products, such as the health benefits of DHA, could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur sales and marketing initiatives may be unsuccessful and our sales and marketing practices may be challenged by consumers and competitors, which could harm our business.\nWe participate in a variety of trade and marketing activities, where permitted. We work with external agencies to create marketing campaigns for consumers, health care professionals and retail sales organizations. We may increase spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share. The success of these initiatives is subject to risk, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts, our ability to communicate our key brand and corporate messages to a growing number of social media users and inventory levels. The success of these initiatives is also subject to potential restrictions on our product marketing (see \u201c-We are subject to extensive governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations. Changes in governmental regulations or other policies could harm our business\u201d and \u201c-Our business is subject to anti-infant formula policies and legislation in various jurisdictions, many of which may impact our operations and effectiveness.\u201d) Further, although our marketing is evidence-based and emphasizes our nutritional science, consumers and competitors have and may challenge certain of our practices by claiming, among other things, false and misleading advertising. A significant claim or judgment against us could result in monetary damages, limit our ability to maintain current sales and marketing practices and negatively impact our profitability. Even if such claim is unsuccessful or unwarranted, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions could negatively impact our business.\nOur global operations are subject to political and economic risks of developing countries, and risks associated with doing business in developing markets.\nWe operate our business and market our products internationally in more than 50 countries. We focus on increasing our sales and operations in various regions throughout the world, which are less developed, have less stability in legal systems and financial markets, and are potentially more uncertain business environments than the United States, and therefore present greater political, economic and operational risks. We have in place controls, policies and procedures, which include ongoing training of employees with regard to business ethics and many key legal requirements, such as applicable anti-corruption laws (e.g. the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the UK Bribery Act (\u201cUKBA\u201d)). However, there can be no assurance that our employees will adhere to our standards of business conduct and ethics or any of our other policies, applicable anti-corruption laws or other legal requirements. If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures, detect violations in a timely manner or maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer damage to our reputation. If we believe or have reason to believe that our employees have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws or other laws or regulations, we investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. If violations are suspected or found, we could face civil and criminal penalties, and significant costs for investigations, litigation, fees, settlements and judgments, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur current and historical effective tax rate may not be indicative of future rates.\nIn light of our global earnings mix, our current and historical effective tax rate may not be indicative of future rates due to changes in domestic and international tax laws (including potential U.S. tax reform), changes in our global earnings mix, the need to repatriate future earnings to the United States to satisfy U.S. cash needs, and changes to our tax positions by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, at the present time, the United States generally taxes a company\u2019s foreign earnings upon the repatriation of such earnings, and these tax rules may change in the foreseeable future. Moreover, given the organization of our business and the locations of our manufacturing operations, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intercompany business in accordance with arms-length principles, taxing authorities may not view such transactions as satisfying such arms-length principles and our tax positions may not be upheld by taxing authorities upon audit of our results. Additionally, the impact of the base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) and the European Commission\u2019s investigations into illegal state aid may result in changes to long-standing tax principles which could adversely impact our effective tax rate.\nChanges in WIC, or our participation in it, could materially adversely affect our business.\nParticipation in WIC involves a competitive bidding process and is an important part of our U.S. business based on the volume of infant formula sold under the program. The general benefits that we derive from holding the WIC contract in a particular state extend beyond the actual sales made in connection with the WIC program in the relevant state. Such benefits include full price sales from product purchased in excess of the rebated volume and the increased presence of our products in hospitals and at retailers. See \u201cItem 1. Business-The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (\u201cWIC\u201d)\u201d for a full description of the WIC program and competitive bidding process.\nOur business strategy includes bidding for new WIC contracts and maintaining current WIC relationships. Our failure to win bids for new contracts pursuant to the WIC program or our inability to maintain current WIC relationships could have a material adverse effect on U.S. sales based on the general benefits of holding these contracts. A number of state WIC contracts expire and are subject to renewed bids by the end of 2017, which could negatively impact future results if we are not successful in retaining currently held WIC contracts. Moreover, under recently awarded WIC contracts, trends have been towards higher rebate levels. If these trends continue, the cost of retaining WIC contracts could adversely affect our U.S. sales and/or operating results. Finally, any changes to how the WIC program is administered, any changes to rebate levels and renewal patterns for WIC contracts, any changes to the eligibility requirements and/or overall participation in the WIC program and any failure to maintain fulfillment or other obligations in connection with current WIC contracts could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nResources devoted to research and development may not yield new products that achieve commercial success.\nOur ability to develop new pediatric nutrition products depends on, among other factors, our ability to understand the composition and variation of breast milk and our ability to translate these insights into commercially viable new products. This requires significant investment in research and development and testing of new ingredients, formulas and new production processes. The R&D process is expensive and prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty. Products may appear promising in development but fail to reach market within the expected time frame, or at all. We may face significant challenges with regard to a key product launch. Further, products also may fail to achieve commercial viability. Finally, there is no guarantee that our development teams will be able to successfully respond to competitive products that could render our products obsolete. Development of a new product, from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch, typically takes between five and seven years, but may require an even longer timeline. Each of these time periods varies considerably from product to product and country to country. Because of the complexities, uncertainties and cost associated with R&D, products that we are currently developing may not complete the development process or\nobtain the regulatory approvals required for us to market such products successfully. New regulations or changes to existing regulations may have a negative effect on innovations in our pipeline, especially late-stage pipeline products. In addition, even when important, clinically demonstrated benefits are achieved in our innovations, regulations in specific countries may not allow us to communicate these benefits, or may severely restrict our ability to do so, even to health care professionals.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nGiven the importance of brand recognition to our business, we have invested considerable effort in trademark protection for our brands, including the Enfa family of brands. In addition, we rely on a combination of security measures, confidentiality policies, contractual arrangements and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary formulas and other valuable trade secrets. We also rely on patent, copyright and trademark laws to further protect our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties inherent in enforcing our intellectual property rights make the outcome and associated costs difficult to predict. A failure to obtain or adequately protect intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other change that serves to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business. In addition, some of the countries in which we operate offer less protection for these rights, and may subject these rights to higher risks than is the case in Europe or North America. Despite our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights on a global basis, counterfeit product or product associated with the illegal use of our intellectual property could cause significant reputational harm.\nThere can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us or that any infringement claim will not result in costly litigation, substantial damages, the need to refrain from selling our products or the need to obtain a license to use third-party intellectual property (which license we may be unable to obtain on favorable terms, or at all). Even if we prevail against such claims, intellectual property litigation could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nIf we are not able to successfully implement our productivity program referred to as \u201cFuel for Growth,\u201d our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe have implemented a productivity program referred to as \u201cFuel for Growth\u201d designed to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. While we expect this program to improve profitability and create additional investments behind brand building and growth initiatives, there are no assurances that such measures will prove to be successful or that the results we achieve through Fuel for Growth will be consistent with our expectations. We cannot provide assurance that we will realize cost savings, operating efficiencies or earnings growth in connection with Fuel for Growth. As a result, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect our business.\nLabor disputes may cause work stoppages, strikes and disruptions.\nOur manufacturing workforces in Zeeland, Michigan (U.S.); Evansville, Indiana (U.S.); Chonburi, Thailand and Singapore are not unionized. The manufacturing workforces in Guangzhou, China are unionized, but operate without a collective bargaining agreement. The manufacturing workforces in Delicias, Mexico, and S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, are unionized and covered by collective bargaining agreements that are negotiated annually. The manufacturing workforce and non-supervisory sales force in Makati, Philippines are unionized and covered by a three-year collective bargaining agreement that was renewed effective January 2017. In addition, European Works Councils represent the manufacturing workforce in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and the commercial organizations in France, Spain and Poland. Any labor disputes, including work stoppages, strikes and disruptions, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFailure to comply with our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain future financing at competitive rates and/or our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness.\nThere are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may be adversely affected. Further, we could incur an adverse impact on our effective tax rate if we need to repatriate earnings to the United States in order to repay such debt.\nWe may not successfully identify or complete acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives and complete such transactions. We may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth / profitability targets. We may also consider expanding our product portfolio by adding new product categories or expanding our operations through acquisitions of manufacturing and other facilities. For instance, on February 27, 2017, the Company announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire assets from Bega Cheese Limited (\u201cBega\u201d). In connection with this transaction, the Company is acquiring from Bega a spray dryer and a finishing plant in Australia and entering into a service agreement to support the operation of those assets. The aggregate consideration\nfor this asset purchase is approximately AUD $200 million. The Company expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2017.\nThese activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risk including diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business, business integration challenges, effective control implementation across a diverse employee population, the failure to achieve anticipated synergies, unanticipated liabilities and potential disputes. These activities may also include inherent risks associated with entering a geographic area which has less political, social or economic stability, less developed infrastructure and legal systems and in which we have no or limited prior operating experience. In addition, we may not be able to complete desirable transactions or initiatives for various financial, regulatory, technological or other reasons. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Our Former Parent\nIf our split-off from BMS fails to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, we may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify BMS for any resulting taxes and related expenses.\nIn connection with our split-off from BMS on December 23, 2009, BMS and its counsel have relied on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from us, as well as certain covenants by us regarding the future conduct of our business and other matters, the incorrectness or violation of which could affect the qualification for non-recognition of gain and loss of our split-off from BMS. As a result, we agreed, generally, to indemnify BMS for taxes and certain related expenses resulting from the failure of our split-off from BMS to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss to the extent attributable to (i) the failure of any of our representations to be true or the breach by us of any of our covenants, (ii) the application of Section 355(e) or Section 355(f) of the Internal Revenue Code to any acquisition of our stock or assets or any of our affiliates or (iii) certain other acts or omissions by us or our affiliates. To the extent we become obligated to make an indemnification payment to BMS through the relevant audit years, we believe that such payment could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.", "PERMNO": 92890, "SIC": 2020, "TIC": "MJN"}
