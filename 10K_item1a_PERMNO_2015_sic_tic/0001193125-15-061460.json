RISK FACTORS\nSignificant Competition from an Array of Financial Service Providers\nOur ability to achieve strong financial performance and a satisfactory return on investment to shareholders will depend in part on our ability to expand our available financial services. In addition to the challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, our competitors now include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services to their customers that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. If we fail to adequately address each of the competitive pressures in the banking industry, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCredit Risk\nThe risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in commercial banking. Such nonpayment could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s earnings and our overall financial condition as well as the value of our common stock. Management attempts to reduce the Bank\u2019s credit exposure by carefully monitoring the concentration of its loans within specific industries and through the loan approval process. However, there can be no assurance that such monitoring and procedures will totally mitigate the risks. Credit losses can cause insolvency and failure of a financial institution and, in such event, its shareholders could lose their entire investment. For more information on the exposure of the Company and the Bank to credit risk, see the section under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K captioned \u201cLoan Portfolio.\u201d\nSusceptibility to Changes in Regulation\nAny changes to state and federal banking laws and regulations may negatively impact our ability to expand services and to increase the value of our business. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds. In addition, the Company\u2019s earnings are affected by the monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. These policies, which include regulating the national supply of bank reserves and bank credit, can have a major effect upon the source and cost of funds and the rates of return earned on loans and investments. The Federal Reserve influences the size and distribution of bank reserves through its open market operations and changes in cash reserve requirements against member bank deposits. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act regarding financial modernization that became effective in November, 1999 removed many of the barriers to the integration of the banking, securities and insurance industries and is likely to increase the competitive pressures upon the Bank. We cannot predict what effect such Act and any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, but such changes could be materially adverse to our financial performance. For more information on this subject, see the section under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways. Our profitability depends in substantial part on our \u201cnet interest spread,\u201d which is the difference between the rates we receive on loans and investments and the rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funds. Our net interest spread will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Historically, net interest spreads for other financial institutions have widened and narrowed in response to these and other factors, which are often collectively referred to as \u201cinterest rate\nrisk.\u201d Over the last few years, the Bank, along with most other financial institutions, has experienced a \u201cmargin squeeze\u201d as drastic interest rate decreases have made it difficult to maintain a more favorable net interest spread. During 2014, the Bank\u2019s margin and spread began to improve slightly even though the rate environment remained low and flat. Maturities of higher rate deposits aided the decrease in cost of funds. This widening of the margin directly correlated to the improvement of the Bank\u2019s loan to asset ratio.\nThe Bank manages interest rate risk within an overall asset/liability framework. The principal objectives of asset/liability management are to manage sensitivity of net interest spreads and net interest income to potential changes in interest rates. Funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk-taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed. In the event that our asset/liabilities management strategies are unsuccessful, our profitability may be adversely affected. For more information regarding the Company\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk, see Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K.\nAttraction and Retention of Key Personnel\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our senior management team and upon our ability to attract and retain qualified financial services personnel. Competition for qualified employees is intense. In our experience, it can take a significant period of time to identify and hire personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required in carrying out our strategy. If we lose the services of our key personnel, or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nA key component of employee retention is providing a fair compensation base combined with the opportunity for additional compensation for above average performance. In this regard, the Company and the Bank use two incentive programs. The Company uses a stock award program to recognize and incent officers of the Bank. Under the long-term incentive compensation plan, restricted stock awards may be granted to officers. The amount of shares to be granted each year is determined by the Board Compensation Committee and may vary each year in its amount of shares and the number of recipients. The Compensation Committee determines the number of shares to be awarded overall and to the Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) specifically. The CEO then makes recommendations to the committee as to the recipients of the remaining shares. The full Board of Directors approves the action of the Committee. Since the plan\u2019s inception in 2005, all granted stock awards have utilized a three year cliff vesting feature. This is viewed as a retention aid as the awards may be forfeited should an officer leave employment during the vesting period.\nA second incentive program of the Bank is based on cash compensation of which almost all employees participate (excluding commission based employees and other employees paid for specific higher paid positions, such as peak time.) A discussion of executive officer pay is incorporated within the proxy and as such, this discussion will pertain to all other employees. Non-officer employees are paid a cash incentive based on the projected overall performance of the Bank in terms of Return of Average Assets (\u201cROA\u201d). The Compensation Committee determines the target performance levels on which the percentage of pay will be based. The Committee takes into account the five and ten year trend of ROA along with budget forecasted for the next year and the Bank\u2019s past year performance. The Committee also considers the predicted banking environment under which the Bank will be operating. Non-officers receive incentive pay in December of the same year based on the year-to-date base compensation through the last pay received in November.\nOfficers, other than executive, receive incentive pay based on additional criterion. The officers are rewarded based on overall ROA of the Bank along with individual pre-established goals. Officers, therefore, have incentive pay at risk for individual performance. The individualized goals are recommended by each officer\u2019s supervisor and are approved by an incentive committee of the Bank. The goals are designed to improve the performance of the Bank while also limiting the risk of a short-term performance focus. For example, a lending officer may be given two goals of which one is to grow loans within specific targets and another is tied to a specific level of past dues and charge-offs. The second goal limits the ability to be rewarded for growth at all costs along with the specific target levels within the growth goal itself. Officers in a support department may be given goals which create efficiencies, ensure compliance with procedures, or generate new fee or product opportunities. An average of three to four goals was given to each officer in 2014. Officers are paid cash incentives based on the year-end ROA of the Bank and receive it within the first quarter of the following year. Should the ROA be forecasted to be positive but below the base target set by the Board, the officers are paid an incentive under the same basis and timing as non-officers disclosed above.\nThe percentages of base pay on which the incentive is calculated graduates higher as does the responsibility level of the employee and their ability to impact the financial performance of the Bank. These percentages are recommended by management to the Compensation Committee and Board for approval. The cash incentive plan along with its targets and goals are subject to modification at the Compensation Committee and Board\u2019s discretion throughout each year.\nDividend Payout Restrictions\nWe currently pay a quarterly dividend on our common shares. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends in the future. Dividends are subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors, which takes into account many factors. The declaration of dividends by us on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board and to applicable state and federal regulatory limitations. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on its receipt of dividends from the Bank. The Bank is subject to restrictions and limitations in the amount and timing of the dividends it may pay to the Company.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Ohio law could have the effect of discouraging takeover attempts which certain stockholders might deem to be in their interest. These anti-takeover provisions may make us a less attractive target for a takeover bid or merger, potentially depriving shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares of common stock at a premium over prevailing market prices as a result of a takeover bid or merger.\nOperational Risks\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable, but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls, uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLimited Trading Market\nThe Company moved its shares of stock to a new OTC Markets Group trading platform. Our stock is traded on the OTC-QX platform. The Company\u2019s trading symbol is \u201cFMAO\u201d.", "PERMNO": 16703, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FMAO"}
