Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings before making a decision to invest in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial conditions and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock and warrants may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risks Affecting our Company\nOur business is subject to numerous risks described in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below and elsewhere in this prospectus, including the risk factors incorporated by reference herein. A summary of the material risk factors affecting our business is set forth below. Other risk factors you should consider are discussed more fully in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page S-6, which you should read in its entirety.\n\u25cf Intermediate may be unable to successfully execute its growth strategy.\n\u25cf MICT\u2019s ability to be successful will be dependent upon the efforts of the MICT Board and key personnel and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of MICT\u2019s post-combination business.\n\u25cf We may need a significant amount of additional capital, which could substantially dilute your investment.\n\u25cf If MICT fails to meet all applicable Nasdaq requirements, Nasdaq may delist its Common Stock, which could have an adverse impact on its liquidity and market price.\n\u25cf MICT\u2019s stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Company\u2019s acquisition of Intermediate commensurate with the ownership dilution they experienced in connection with the acquisition.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect MICT\u2019s business and operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect Intermediate\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s business and thereby have a material adverse effect on MICT\u2019s investment in Intermediate and Micronet.\n\u25cf Because almost all of MICT\u2019s officers and directors are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, you may have no effective recourse against management for misconduct.\n\u25cf MICT anticipates that its operating costs and expenses will increase.\n\u25cf Intermediate\u2019s platform and internal systems rely on software and technological infrastructure that is highly technical, and if they contain undetected errors, its business could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Changes in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n\u25cf The complexities, uncertainties and rapid changes in PRC regulation of the Internet-related businesses and companies require significant resources for compliance and the uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to us.\n\u25cf The 2006 M&A Rules established complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it difficult to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\n\u25cf Fluctuations in exchange rates of the RMB could materially affect financial results. Furthermore, MICT\u2019s financial results may be negatively affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\u25cf Under the enterprise income tax (\u201cEIT\u201d) Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences.\n\u25cf Discontinuation of preferential tax treatments we currently enjoy or other unfavorable changes in tax law could result in additional compliance obligations and costs.\n\u25cf Potential political, economic and military instability in Israel could adversely affect operations.\n\u25cf We have issued and may issue additional preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our Common Stock.\n\u25cf Intermediate\u2019s trading platforms have no operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate Intermediate\u2019s future prospects.\n\u25cf Micronet is dependent on major customers for a significant portion of revenues, and therefore, future revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted by the loss or reduction of the demand for Micronet\u2019s products or services by such customers.\n\u25cf Micronet operates in a highly competitive and fragmented market and may not be able to maintain a competitive position in the future. Any such failure to successfully compete could have a material adverse effect on the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nRisk Factors Related to the Integration of Intermediate and Ownership of MICT\u2019s Securities\nIntermediate may be unable to successfully execute its growth strategy.\nOne of the Intermediate\u2019s strategies is to pursue organic growth by increasing product offerings and expanding into new verticals and new markets such as China. Intermediate may not be able to successfully execute all or any of these initiatives, and the results may vary from the expectations of the combined entity or others. Further, even if these initiatives are successful, Intermediate may not be able to expand and upgrade its technology systems and infrastructure to accommodate increases in the business activity in a timely manner, which could lead to operational breakdowns and delays, loss of customers, a reduction in the growth of its customer base, increased operating expenses, financial losses, increased litigation or customer claims, regulatory sanctions or increased regulatory scrutiny. In addition, Intermediate will need to continue to attract, hire and retain highly skilled and motivated executives and employees to both execute the growth strategy and to manage the resulting growth effectively.\nPrior to completion of the Merger, Intermediate did not have any formal risk management policies or procedures which may leave Intermediate exposed to unidentified or unexpected risks.\nPrior to the Merger, Intermediate was dependent on the professional expertise and experience of its management and staff to assess risks. Intermediate did not have any formal written policies or procedures for identifying, monitoring or controlling risks, including risks related to human error, customer defaults, market movements, technology, fraud or money-laundering, and such risks were evaluated by its management team and boards of directors on an ad-hoc basis. Such practices and methods have historically been discretionary by nature and based on internally developed controls and observed historical market behavior. These methods may not adequately prevent losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements, which may be significantly greater than historical fluctuations in the market. The risk-management methods utilized by Intermediate also may not adequately prevent losses due to technical errors if its testing and quality control practices are not effective in preventing failures.\nMICT may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition and its share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nMICT cannot assure you that the due diligence it conducted on Intermediate has revealed all material issues that may be present with regard to such companies, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that risks outside of MICT\u2019s control will not later arise. Each of MICT and Intermediate therefore has made its decision to complete the Merger on the basis of limited information, and the business combination may not be as profitable as expected, if at all. As a result of these factors, MICT may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses. Even if MICT\u2019s due diligence successfully identified certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with MICT\u2019s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and would not have an immediate impact on MICT\u2019s liquidity, the fact that MICT reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about MICT or MICT\u2019s securities. Accordingly, MICT cannot predict the impact that the consummation of the Merger will have on MICT\u2019s securities.\nMICT\u2019s ability to be successful will be dependent upon the efforts of the MICT Board and key personnel and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of MICT\u2019s post-combination business.\nMICT\u2019s ability to be successful will be dependent upon the efforts of the MICT Board and key personnel. Furthermore, the business of MICT following the Merger is made up in part of Intermediate\u2019s business, and is entirely different from MICT\u2019s historical business. Individuals associated with Intermediate may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a U.S. public company, which could cause MICT\u2019s management to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nMICT is dependent on the services of its executive officers, whose potential conflicts of interest may not permit MICT to effectively execute its business strategy.\nMICT is currently dependent on the continued services and performance of its executive officers, particularly Darren Mercer, MICT\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and a director of the MICT Board. Darren Mercer, is also the Chief Executive Officer of GFH which may result in a potential conflict of interest in Mr. Mercer carrying out his duties as a member of the MICT Board.\nProvisions in MICT\u2019s certificate of incorporation and under Delaware law could make a future acquisition of MICT, which may be beneficial to stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by MICT stockholders to replace or remove the current management.\nProvisions in MICT\u2019s certificate of incorporation, as amended, and MICT\u2019s amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for MICT\u2019s common stock. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for MICT securities, thereby depressing the market price of MICT\u2019s securities. In addition, these provisions may frustrate, deter or prevent any attempts by MICT stockholders to replace or remove current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the MICT Board. Because the MICT Board is responsible for appointing the members of the MICT management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by stockholders to replace current members of the MICT management team.\nMoreover, because MICT is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with MICT for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. MICT has not opted out of the restrictions under Section 203.\nWe may need a significant amount of additional capital, which could substantially dilute your investment.\nWe may need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such funds upon favorable terms and conditions, if at all. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell Common Stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in one or more transactions that may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, and conversion and redemption rights, subject to applicable law, and at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time.\nSuch issuances and the exercise of any convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders and may affect the value of our capital stock and could adversely affect the rights of the holders of such stock, thereby reducing the value of such stock. Moreover, any exercise of convertible securities may adversely affect the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital, since the holders of such convertible securities can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in such convertible securities.\nIf we sell shares or other equity securities in one or more other transactions, or issue stock or stock options pursuant to any future employee equity incentive plan, investors may be materially diluted by such subsequent issuances.\nIf the price of our Common Stock is volatile, purchasers of our securities could incur substantial losses.\nThe price of MICT\u2019s Common Stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of MICT\u2019s Common Stock may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf developments regarding the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby;\n\u25cf announcements of developments related to MICT\u2019s business (including those aspects of MICT\u2019s business received in connection with the Merger);\n\u25cf quarterly fluctuations in actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations;\n\u25cf new products or product enhancements introduced by Micronet or its competitors;\n\u25cf developments in patents and other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u25cf developments in relationships with third party manufacturers and/or strategic partners;\n\u25cf developments in relationships with customers and/or suppliers;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States, Israel, China and other countries;\n\u25cf general conditions in the global economy; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nFor these reasons and others, you should consider an investment in our Common Stock as risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the value of such investment.\nA sale by MICT of a substantial number of shares of the Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock may cause the price of the Common Stock to decline and may impair the ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur Common Stock is traded on Nasdaq and despite certain increases of trading volume from time to time, there have been periods when it could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing Common Stock at or near bid prices at any given time may have been relatively small or non-existent. Financing transactions resulting in a large amount of newly-issued securities, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of Common Stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of Common Stock to sell those shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of MICT stock. If MICT stockholders sell, or the market perceives that its stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of Common Stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock may make it more difficult for MICT to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that MICT deems reasonable or appropriate. Moreover, MICT may become involved in securities class action litigation arising out of volatility resulting from such sales that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm MICT\u2019s business.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in other businesses, features or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our market, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. In addition, to the extent that we enter into any term sheets or otherwise announce any intention to acquire any additional businesses, features or technologies, any such acquisition would generally be subject to completion of due diligence and required approvals, and would require additional financing, and there can be no assurance that any such acquisition will occur or be completed in a timely manner, or at all.\nIf we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, existing contracts and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from any acquired business, due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, product quality and safety, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or client issues;\n\u25cf difficulty incorporating acquired technology and rights into our proprietary software and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brands;\n\u25cf inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u25cf incurrence of acquisition-related costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition;\n\u25cf difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u25cf risks of entering new markets or new product categories in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u25cf difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business into our customers;\n\u25cf diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf adverse effects to our existing business relationships as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, clients, vendors and suppliers from either our current business or an acquired company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u25cf possible write offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses;\n\u25cf compliance with regulatory matters covering the products of the acquired business; and\n\u25cf use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about MICT\u2019s business, the price of its Common Stock could decline.\nMICT does not currently have any significant research coverage by securities and industry analysts and may never obtain such research coverage. If securities or industry analysts do not commence or maintain coverage of MICT, the trading price for its Common Stock might be negatively affected. In the event such securities or industry analyst coverage is obtained, if one or more of the analysts who covers MICT or will cover MICT downgrades its securities, the price of Common Stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover MICT or fails to publish regular reports on it, interest in the purchase of Common Stock could decrease, which could cause the price of Common Stock and trading volume to decline.\nIf MICT fails to meet all applicable Nasdaq requirements, Nasdaq may delist its Common Stock, which could have an adverse impact on its liquidity and market price.\nMICT\u2019s common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, which has qualitative and quantitative listing criteria. If MICT is unable to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, including, for example, if the closing bid price for common stock continues to fall below $1.00 per share in breach of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), Nasdaq could determine to delist the common stock, which could adversely affect its market liquidity market price. In that regard, on July 22, 2019, December 12, 2018 and September 1, 2017, MICT received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the closing bid price of its common stock had been below $1.00 per share for each of the consecutive 30 business days preceding July 22, 2019, December 12, 2018 and September 1, 2017. In addition, on April 8, 2019, MICT received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), as MICT\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity, as reported MICT\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, was below the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement of $2.5 million. Although MICT was able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b)(1), there can be no assurance that MICT will be able to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, or that the common stock will not be delisted from Nasdaq in the future. Such delisting could adversely affect the ability to obtain financing for the continuation of MICT\u2019s operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, customers and employees and cause its shareholders to incur substantial losses.\nIf Nasdaq delists MICT\u2019s securities from trading on its exchange and MICT is not able to list its securities on another national securities exchange, MICT expects its securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, MICT could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for its securities;\n\u25cf a determination that the MICT\u2019s common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in the MICT\u2019s common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for MICT\u2019s securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nMICT\u2019s stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nIf MICT is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits anticipated from the Merger, MICT\u2019s stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in MICT without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent MICT is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits anticipated from the Merger.\nIntermediate may be subject to new or different statutory and regulatory requirements in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d).\nAs the global regulatory and tax environment evolves, Intermediate may be subject to new or different statutory and regulatory requirements (for example, on January 1, 2019 the Economic Substance (Companies and Limited Partnerships) Act, 2018 of the British Virgin Islands came into force). It is difficult to predict what impact the adoption of these laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could have on Intermediate, however, compliance with various additional obligations may create significant additional costs that may be borne by Intermediate or otherwise affect the management and operation of Intermediate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect MICT\u2019s business and operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread to multiple countries, including the United States, Israel and many European countries and affected the Micronet business as set hereunder. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. While COVID-19 is still spreading and the final implications of the pandemic are difficult to estimate at this stage, it is clear that it has affected the lives of a large portion of the global population. At this time, the pandemic has caused states of emergency to be declared in various countries, travel restrictions imposed globally, quarantines established in certain jurisdictions and various institutions and companies being closed. MICT is actively monitoring the pandemic in order to respond the changing business and market conditions accordingly.\nManagement has considered the consequences of COVID 19 and other events and conditions, and it has determined that they do not create a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt upon the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe impact of COVID 19 on future performance and therefore on the measurement of some assets and liabilities or on liquidity might be significant and might therefore require disclosure in the financial statements, but management has determined that they do not create a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt upon the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nMICT\u2019s operations and business have experienced disruptions due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the spread of COVID-19 throughout China, North America, Israel and the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and both public and private measures taken to contain it have negatively affected MICT\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, all of which may continue or worsen. The following are some of the issues that MICT continues to face:\n\u25cf Prolonged recessionary concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction of economic activity in the U.S., and the markets in which Micronet operates as stated above as well as a significant increase in unemployment, which could lead to a prolonged economic recession;\n\u25cf Actual and potential delays in customer payments, defaults on the MICT\u2019s customer credit arrangements; or other failures by third parties such as suppliers, and distributors to meet their obligations to MICT due to their economic circumstances. The financial markets have also been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially causing operational cash flow issues for MICT, and potentially causing similar issues for MICT\u2019s customers, including, but not limited to, affecting their ability to meet their payment obligations to us; and\n\u25cf Interruptions in manufacturing or distribution of MICT\u2019s products. Outbreaks in the communities in which MICT operates could affect its ability to operate its manufacturing or distribution activities, and MICT\u2019s suppliers could experience similar interruptions.\nDue to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, MICT will continue to assess the situation, including government-imposed restrictions, market by market. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on MICT\u2019s business, the continued spread of COVID-19, and any additional measures taken by governments, health officials or by MICT in response to such spread, could have on MICT\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have also negatively impacted global economic conditions, which, in turn, could adversely affect MICT\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak continues to impact MICT\u2019s financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity, longevity and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity.\nEven after COVID-19 has subsided, MICT may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to its business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19, or a similar health epidemic or pandemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. While MICT continues to monitor the business metrics that it has historically used to predict its financial performance, it is uncertain as to whether these metrics will continue to function as they have in the past.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect Intermediate\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s business and thereby have a material adverse effect on MICT\u2019s investment in Intermediate and Micronet.\nMICT may not realize the benefits of its investment in Intermediate and Micronet if as a result of, among other things, COVID-19, Intermediate\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s business and operations suffer a material adverse effect. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Micronet has suffered a material adverse impact on its business and operations, results of operations and financial condition due to, among other things, a delay in receiving customers\u2019 orders and the general negative economic climate that has resulted from COVID-19. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a material adverse change in the general business and economic atmosphere in the world and in Israel and a negative sentiment in both the business and capital markets, which includes a substantial and significant decrease in demand for the products offered by Micronet, leading to a slowdown in production and delivery, as well as the cancellation of orders by its customers or rejection of development by manufacturers and suppliers.\nMoreover, government restrictions imposed in China impacted Micronet\u2019s manufacturing and subcontracting operations in China were affected for a certain period of time due to COVID-19. Similarly, GFH\u2019s business and operations in China have been impacted by COVID-19 as well. In addition, activities related to the development of various components of Micronet\u2019s products have not yet returned to regular levels. Although the facilities overseeing a portion of these activities have returned to operation, GFH and Micronet do not know if limitations that were previously lifted will be reinstated or whether limitations that are still in effect will be lifted in the near term. As such, Micronet\u2019s management believes that there will be a delay in launching its new products to the market and they will not be completed before first quarter of 2021.\nWe have issued and may issue additional preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our Common Stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue shares of preferred stock, it could affect stockholder rights or reduce the market value of our outstanding Common Stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nMICT may be subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims or proceedings.\nMICT\u2019s business operations entail substantial litigation and regulatory risks, including the risk of lawsuits and other legal actions relating to, among other matters, breach of contract, information disclosure, client onboarding procedures, sales practices, product design, fraud and misconduct, and control procedures deficiencies, as well as the protection of personal and confidential information of MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s or Micronet\u2019s clients. MICT or its subsidiaries may be subject to arbitration claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business. MICT or its subsidiaries may also be subject to inquiries, inspections, investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies. MICT and its subsidiaries will be subject to extensive and evolving regulatory requirements, non-compliance with which, may result in penalties, limitations and prohibitions on its future business activities or suspension or revocation of its licenses and trading rights, and consequently may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, as well as certain private placements completed by the Company, may give rise to litigation and/or other legal disputes. As previously disclosed, in March 2017, MICT entered into an Investment Banking Agreement (the \u201cSunrise Agreement\u201d) with Sunrise Securities LLC and Trump Securities LLC (collectively, \u201cSunrise\u201d) through Sunrise\u2019s principal, Amnon Mandelbaum, pursuant to which Sunrise agreed to assist MICT in identifying, analyzing, structuring, and negotiating suitable business opportunities, such as a sale of stock or assets, merger, tender offer, joint venture, financing arrangement, private placement, or any similar transaction or combination thereof. The parties had disagreements about, among other things, the applicability of the Sunrise Agreement, and the Company received demand letters and other correspondences from Sunrise threatening litigation in connection therewith. As of the date hereof, the parties have executed a settlement and release agreement for the release and waiver of the above claims however, MICT was not able to timely file a registration statement to register the shares, and shares underlying the warrants per the settlement agreement. The Sunrise parties notified MICT that it has breached the settlement agreement. MICT has made a significant offer to the Sunrise parties to settle such matter and is negotiating with the Sunrise parties to resolve this issue immediately. For further details see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below.\nActions brought against MICT or its subsidiaries may result in settlements, injunctions, fines, penalties, suspension or revocation of licenses, reprimands or other results adverse to it that could harm its reputation. Even if MICT is successful in defending itself against these actions, the costs of such defense may be significant. In market downturns, the number of legal claims and the amount of damages sought in legal proceedings may increase.\nIn addition, MICT may face arbitration claims and lawsuits brought by its or tis subsidiaries\u2019 users and clients who use its services and find them unsatisfactory. MICT may also encounter complaints alleging misrepresentation with regard to its platforms and/or services. Actions brought against MICT may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to it including harm to its reputation. Even if MICT is successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in its incurring significant expenses. Predicting the outcome of such matters is inherently difficult, particularly where claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages, or when arbitration or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A significant judgement or regulatory action against MICT or a material disruption in Intermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business arising from adverse adjudications in proceedings against the directors, officers or employees would have a material adverse effect on MICT\u2019s liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause almost all of MICT\u2019s officers and directors are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, you may have no effective recourse against management for misconduct.\nCurrently, a majority of MICT\u2019s directors and officers are or will be nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state. Additionally, it may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities law in original actions instituted in Israel, the UK or PRC. UK, PRC or Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because such jurisdictions are not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if such courts agree to hear a claim, they may determine that Israeli, UK or PRC law, as applicable, and not U.S. law is applicable to hear the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure may also be governed by UK, PRC or Israeli law.\nMICT\u2019s financial results may be negatively affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nMICT\u2019s revenues are mainly denominated in U.S. Dollars and prior to the Merger, costs were mainly denominated in New Israeli Shekels (\u201cNIS\u201d). Where possible, MICT matches sales and purchases in these and other currencies to achieve a natural hedge. Currently, Micronet does not have a policy with respect to the use of derivative instruments for hedging purposes, except that Micronet will consider engaging in such hedging activities on a case by case basis. To the extent MICT is unable to fully match sales and purchases in different currencies, its business will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Following the Merger, Intermediate\u2019s revenue and expenses have been and are expected to continue to be primarily denominated in RMB and we are exposed to the risks associated with the fluctuation in the currency exchange rate of RMB. Should RMB appreciate against other currencies, the value of the proceeds from this offering and any future financings, which are to be converted from U.S. dollar or other currencies into RMB, would be reduced and might accordingly hinder our business development due to the lessened amount of funds raised. Substantial fluctuation in the currency exchange rate of RMB may have a material adverse effect on Intermediate\u2019s business, operations and financial position and the value of your investment in the Units.\nRisk Factors Relating to Intermediate\u2019s Business\nIntermediate\u2019s trading platforms have no operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate Intermediate\u2019s future prospects.\nIntermediate is focused on developing its various trading platforms and technology infrastructure, which have not launched. As Intermediate\u2019s platforms will be built on technology and a significant portion of Intermediate\u2019s staff come from Internet and technology companies, Intermediate has limited experience in most aspects of its trading platform business operation, such as trading of stock, oil and gas, and insurance brokerage. Any aspect of Intermediate\u2019s business model that does not achieve expected results may have a material and adverse impact on Intermediate\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. It is therefore difficult to effectively assess MICT\u2019s future prospects.\nIntermediate\u2019s targeted markets, including online stock trading, oil and gas trading, and insurance brokerage may not develop as expected. Intermediate\u2019s users and clients of Intermediate\u2019s services may not be familiar with the development of these markets and may have difficulty distinguishing Intermediate\u2019s services from those of Intermediate\u2019s competitors. Convincing users and clients of the value of using Intermediate\u2019s services will be critical to increasing the amount of transactions on Intermediate\u2019s platforms and to the success of Intermediate businesses.\nYou should consider Intermediate\u2019s businesses in light of the risks and challenges it encounters or may encounter given the rapidly evolving markets in which it operates and its lack of operating history. These risks and challenges include our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf manage the launch of its trading platforms and its future growth;\n\u25cf navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment;\n\u25cf offer personalized and competitive services;\n\u25cf increase the utilization of its services by users and clients;\n\u25cf maintain and enhance its relationships with its business partners;\n\u25cf enhance its technology infrastructure to support the growth of its business and maintain the security of its systems and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across its systems;\n\u25cf improve its operational efficiency;\n\u25cf attract, retain and motivate talented employees to support its business growth;\n\u25cf navigate economic condition and fluctuation;\n\u25cf defend itself against legal and regulatory actions, such as actions involving intellectual property or privacy claims; and\n\u25cf obtain any and all licenses necessary for the operation of its business.\nIntermediate may not be able to manage its expansion effectively.\nIntermediate\u2019s current and planned personnel, systems, resources and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage its future operations. Intermediate\u2019s plans for continuous expansion may increase the complexity of its business and may place a strain on its management, operations, technical systems, financial resources and internal control functions. Intermediate intends to upgrade its systems from time to time to cater to the need of launching new services, and the process of upgrading its systems may disrupt its ability to timely and accurately process information, which could adversely affect its results of operations and cause harm to its business.\nIf Intermediate is unable to attract and retain clients, or if it fails to offer services to address the needs of its clients as it evolves, Intermediate\u2019s business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf there is insufficient demand for Intermediate\u2019s services, it might not be able to achieve and increase its transaction volume and revenues as it expects, and its and MICT\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIntermediate\u2019s success will depend largely on its ability to attract and retain clients, in particular those that have highly frequent transactions. Failure to deliver services in a timely manner at competitive prices with satisfactory experience will cause clients to lose confidence in Intermediate and use its platforms less frequently or even stop using its platforms altogether, which in turn will materially and adversely affect Intermediate\u2019s business. Even if Intermediate is able to provide high-quality and satisfactory services on its platforms in a timely manner and at favorable price terms, MICT cannot assure you that Intermediate will be able to attract and retain clients, encourage repeat and increase trading transactions due to reasons out of its control, such as Intermediate\u2019s clients\u2019 personal financial reasons or the deterioration of the market conditions.\nIf Intermediate is unable to generate clients and increase its client retention rates in a cost-effective manner, Intermediate\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations are likely to be adversely affected. Although MICT expects to spend significant financial resources on marketing expenses, these efforts may not be cost-effective to attract clients to Intermediate. MICT cannot assure its investors that Intermediate will be able to gain, maintain, or grow a client base in a cost-effective way, if at all.\nMICT will depend on Intermediate\u2019s proprietary technology, and its future results may be impacted if it cannot maintain technological superiority in its industry.\nMICT\u2019s potential success depends on Intermediate\u2019s sophisticated proprietary technology to empower the efficient operations of its platforms. If Intermediate\u2019s technology becomes more widely available to its current or future competitors for any reason, its operating results may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, to keep pace with changing technologies and client demands, Intermediate must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of its technology in response to these trends, which may lead to significant research and development costs. Intermediate may be unable to accurately determine the needs of its users and clients or the trends of the various industries it anticipates to enter or to design and implement the appropriate features and functionality of its technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in decreased demand for its services and a corresponding decrease in its revenue. Also, any adoption or development of similar or more advanced technologies by its competitors may require that MICT devotes substantial resources to the development of more advanced technology at Intermediate to remain competitive. The markets in which Intermediate competes are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing trading systems, practices and techniques. Intermediate may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes in the future, develop new technology, realize a return on amounts invested in developing new technologies or remain competitive in the future.\nIn addition, Intermediate must protect its systems against physical damage from fire, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, physical break-ins and similar events. Any software or hardware damage or failure that causes interruption or an increase in response time of its proprietary technology could reduce client satisfaction and decrease usage of its services.\nUnexpected network interruptions, security breaches or computer virus attacks and failures in Intermediate\u2019s information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntermediate\u2019s information technology systems will support all phases of its operations and will be an essential part of its technology infrastructure. If Intermediate\u2019s systems fail to perform, it could experience disruptions in operations, slower response time or decreased customer satisfaction. Intermediate must be able to process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and its operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including unexpected interruptions to the Internet infrastructure, technological failures, changes to Intermediate\u2019s systems, changes in customer usage patterns, linkages with third-party systems and power failures. Intermediate\u2019s systems will also be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for risk management and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, distributed denial of service attacks, computer viruses or cyberattacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting Intermediate\u2019s key business partners and vendors, and other similar events.\nIntermediate\u2019s Internet-based businesses depend on the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure. Intermediate cannot assure its investors that the Internet infrastructure it depends on will remain sufficiently reliable for its needs. Any failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security or availability of Intermediate\u2019s network infrastructure may cause significant damage to its ability to attract and retain users and clients. Major risks involving Intermediate\u2019s network infrastructure include:\n\u25cf breakdowns or system failures resulting in a prolonged shutdown of its servers;\n\u25cf disruption or failure in the national backbone networks in the PRC, which would make it impossible for users and clients to access its platforms;\n\u25cf damage from natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as typhoon, volcanic eruption, earthquake, flood, telecommunications failure, or other similar events; and\n\u25cf any infection by or spread of computer viruses or other system failures.\nAny network interruption or inadequacy that causes interruptions in the availability of Intermediate\u2019s platforms or deterioration in the quality of access to its platforms could reduce user and client satisfaction and result in a reduction in the activity level of its users and clients as well as the number of clients making trading transactions on its platforms. Furthermore, increases in the volume of traffic on Intermediate\u2019s platforms could strain the capacity of its computer systems and bandwidth, which could lead to slower response times or system failures. This could cause a disruption or suspension in Intermediate\u2019s service delivery, which could hurt its brand and reputation. Intermediate may need to incur additional costs to upgrade its technology infrastructure and computer systems in order to accommodate increased demand if it anticipates that its systems cannot handle higher volumes of traffic and transaction in the future. In addition, it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to its technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect its ability to process and settle client transactions. Despite Intermediate\u2019s efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risks, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory actions due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of its vendors or other third parties.\nFailure or poor performance of third-party software, infrastructure or systems on which Intermediate relies could adversely affect its business.\nIntermediate will rely on third parties to provide and maintain certain infrastructure that will be critical to its business. For example, a strategic partner provides services to Intermediate in connection with various aspects of Intermediate\u2019s operations and systems. If such services become limited, restricted, curtailed or less effective or more expensive in any way or become unavailable to Intermediate for any reason, its business may be materially and adversely affected. The infrastructure of Intermediate\u2019s third-party service providers may malfunction or fail due to events out of its control, which could disrupt its operations and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any failure to maintain and renew Intermediate\u2019s relationships with these third parties on commercially favorable terms, or to enter into similar relationships in the future, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIntermediate also relies on certain third-party software, computer systems and service providers. Any interruption in these third-party services or software, deterioration in their performance, or other improper operation could interfere with its trading activities, cause losses due to erroneous or delayed responses, or otherwise be disruptive to its business. If Intermediate\u2019s arrangements with any third party are terminated, it may not be able to find an alternative source of software or systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. This could also have a material adverse effect on Intermediate\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf Intermediate fails to protect its platform or the confidential information of its users and clients, whether due to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other reasons, it may be subject to liabilities imposed by relevant laws and regulations, and its reputation and business may be materially and adversely affected.\nMICT\u2019s and Intermediate\u2019s computer system, the networks it uses, the networks and online trading platforms of the exchanges and other third parties with whom it interacts, are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic computer break-ins, viruses and similar disruptive problems or security breaches. A party that is able to circumvent MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or customer information, jeopardize the confidential nature of the information MICT or Intermediate transmits over the Internet and mobile network or cause interruptions in its operations. MICT, Intermediate or its respective service providers may be required to invest significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches.\nIn addition, MICT and Intermediate will collect, store and process certain personal and other sensitive data from its users and clients, which makes MICT and Intermediate potentially vulnerable targets to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions. While MICT and Intermediate will take steps to protect the confidential information that it expects to have access to, its security measures could be breached. Because the techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, MICT and Intermediate may not be able to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s system could cause confidential user and client information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose MICT and Intermediate to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s technology infrastructure are exposed and exploited, its relationships with users and clients could be severely damaged, it could incur significant liability and its stock trading platform business and operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, Intermediate\u2019s corporate clients may utilize its technology to serve their own employees and customers. Any failure or perceived failure by MICT or Intermediate to prevent information security breaches or to comply with privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, could cause Intermediate\u2019s clients to lose trust in it and could expose Intermediate to legal claims.\nThere are uncertainties as to the interpretation and application of laws in one jurisdiction which may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent to another jurisdiction and may conflict with MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s policies and practices or require changes to the features of its system. MICT and Intermediate cannot assure that its user information protection system and technical measures will be considered sufficient under applicable laws and regulations. If MICT or Intermediate is unable to address any information protection concerns, any compromise of security that results unauthorized disclosure or transfer of personal data, or to comply with the then applicable laws and regulations, it may incur additional costs and liability and result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause its users and clients to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on its stock trading platform business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. MICT and Intermediate may also be subject to new laws, regulations or standards or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or standards, including those in the areas of data security and data privacy, which could require MICT or Intermediate to incur additional costs and restrict its stock trading platform business operations.\nEmployee misconduct could expose Intermediate to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nIntermediate\u2019s platforms will operate in industries in which integrity and the confidence of its users and clients are of critical importance. During Intermediate\u2019s daily operations, it will be subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by its employees, which include:\n\u25cf engaging in misrepresentation or fraudulent activities when marketing or performing services to users and clients;\n\u25cf improperly using or disclosing confidential information of its users and clients or other parties;\n\u25cf concealing unauthorized or unsuccessful activities; or\n\u25cf otherwise not complying with applicable laws and regulations or its internal policies or procedures.\nIf any of Intermediate\u2019s employees engages in illegal or suspicious activities or other misconduct, it could suffer serious harm to its reputation, financial condition, client relationships and ability to attract new clients and even be subject to regulatory sanctions and significant legal liability. Intermediate may also be subject to negative publicity from the sanction that would adversely affect its brand, public image and reputation, as well as potential challenges, suspicions, investigations or alleged claims against us. It is not always possible to deter misconduct by its employees or senior management during the operations of its business or uncover any misconduct occurred in their past employment, and the precautions Intermediate takes to detect and prevent any misconduct may not always be effective. Misconduct by Intermediate\u2019s employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on its reputation and its business.\nMICT anticipates that its operating costs and expenses will increase.\nMICT anticipates that its operating costs and expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as it endeavors to launch and grow Intermediate\u2019s business, attract users and clients, enhance and develop its service offerings, enhance its technology capabilities, and increase its brand recognition. These efforts may prove more costly than MICT anticipates, and it may not succeed in generating revenues sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. There are other external and internal factors that could negatively affect MICT\u2019s financial condition. For example, the transaction volume achieved on Intermediate\u2019s platforms may be lower than expected, which may lead to lower than expected revenues. Furthermore, MICT has adopted a share incentive plan in the past and may adopt new share incentive plans in the future, which have caused, and will result in, significant share-based compensation expenses to us. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, MICT may incur net losses in the future.\nIf there is any negative publicity with respect to MICT, its industry peers or its industries in general, MICT\u2019s business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nMICT\u2019s reputation and brand recognition plays an important role in earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of its current and potential users and clients. MICT\u2019s reputation and brand are vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries or investigations, lawsuits initiated by clients or other third parties, employee misconduct, perceptions of conflicts of interest and rumors, among other things, could substantially damage MICT\u2019s reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. In addition, any perception that the quality of its services may not be the same as or better than that of other companies can also damage its reputation. Moreover, any negative media publicity about the industries in general or product or service quality problems of other firms in these industries, including MICT\u2019s competitors, may also negatively impact MICT\u2019s reputation and brand. If MICT is unable to maintain a good reputation or further enhance its brand recognition, its ability to attract and retain users, clients, third-party partners and key employees could be harmed and, as a result, its business and revenues would be materially and adversely affected.\nMICT may not succeed in promoting and sustaining its brand, which could have an adverse effect on its future growth and business.\nA critical component of MICT\u2019s launch and growth will be its ability to promote and sustain its brand. Promoting and positioning MICT\u2019s brand and platforms will depend largely on the success of its marketing efforts, its ability to attract users and clients cost-efficiently and its ability to consistently provide high-quality services and a superior experience. MICT expects to incur significant expenses related to advertising and other marketing efforts, which may not be effective and may adversely affect its net margins.\nIn addition, to provide a high-quality user and client experience, MICT expects to invest substantial amounts of resources in the development and functionality of Intermediate\u2019s platforms, websites, technology infrastructure and client service operations. Intermediate\u2019s ability to provide a high-quality user and client experience will also be highly dependent on external factors over which it may have little or no control, including, without limitation, the reliability and performance of software vendors and business partners. Failure to provide Intermediate\u2019s users and clients with high quality services and experience for any reason could substantially harm its reputation and adversely impact its efforts to develop a trusted brand, which could have a material adverse effect on its stock trading platform business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIntermediate\u2019s platform and internal systems rely on software and technological infrastructure that is highly technical, and if they contain undetected errors, its business could be adversely affected.\nIntermediate\u2019s platforms and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, Intermediate\u2019s platforms and internal systems depend on the ability of the software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. The software may now or in the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which Intermediate relies may result in a negative experience for users and clients, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in errors or compromise Intermediate\u2019s ability to protect data or its intellectual property. Any errors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which it relies could result in harm to Intermediate\u2019s reputation, loss of users or financial service providers or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nAny failure to protect Intermediate\u2019s intellectual property could harm its business and competitive position.\nIntermediate expects to rely primarily on trade secret, contract, copyright, trademark and patent law to protect its proprietary technology. It is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use Intermediate\u2019s proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on its rights. Intermediate may not be able to successfully pursue claims for infringement that interfere with its ability to use its technology, website or other relevant intellectual property or have adverse impact on its brand. Intermediate cannot assure MICT\u2019s investors that any of its intellectual property rights would not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or such intellectual property will be sufficient to provide Intermediate with competitive advantages. In addition, other parties may misappropriate its intellectual property rights, which would cause it to suffer economic or reputational damages. Because of the rapid pace of technological change, MICT cannot assure you that all of Intermediate\u2019s proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property will be patented in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. Furthermore, parts of Intermediate\u2019s business rely on technologies developed or licensed by other parties, or co-developed with other parties, and Intermediate may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these other parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nAny claims or litigation could cause Intermediate and us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against Intermediate or us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, restrict Intermediate or us from conducting our business or require that we or Intermediate comply with other unfavorable terms. We and Intermediate may also be obligated to indemnify parties or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we and Intermediate were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding Intermediate\u2019s intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management from Intermediate and our business operations.\nFrom time to time MICT may evaluate and potentially consummate investments and acquisitions or enter into alliances, which may require significant management attention, disrupt Intermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business and adversely affect its financial results.\nMICT may evaluate and consider strategic investments, combinations, acquisitions or alliances to further increase the value of Intermediate\u2019s platforms and better serve Intermediate\u2019s users and clients. These transactions could be material to its financial condition and results of operations if consummated. MICT may not have the financial resources necessary to consummate any acquisitions in the future or the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. Any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses and risks associated with entering new markets in addition to integration and consolidation risks. MICT may not have sufficient management, financial and other resources to integrate any such future acquisitions or to successfully operate new businesses, and it may be unable to profitably operate its expanded company.\nInternet-related issues may reduce or slow the growth in the use of our services in the future. In particular, our future growth depends on the further acceptance of the Internet in China and particularly the mobile Internet as an effective platform for assessing trading and other financial services and content.\nCritical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet, such as ease of access, security, privacy, reliability, cost, and quality of service, remain unresolved and may adversely impact the growth of Internet use. If Internet usage continues to increase rapidly, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth, and its performance and reliability may decline. Continuous rapid growth in Internet traffic may cause decreased performance, outages and delays. Our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to users and clients and to increase the scope and quality of such services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of Intermediate\u2019s users\u2019 and clients\u2019 access to the Internet, which is beyond our control. If periods of decreased performance, outages or delays on the Internet occur frequently or other critical issues concerning the Internet are not resolved, overall Internet usage or usage of our web-based services could increase more slowly or decline, which would cause Intermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business, results of operations and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected.\nIntermediate face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt its operations.\nIntermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, health epidemics or other public safety concerns. Natural disasters may give rise to server interruptions, breakdowns, system failures, technology platform failures or Internet failures, which could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware as well as adversely affect its ability to operate its platform and provide services and solutions. Intermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business could also be adversely affected if its employees are affected by health epidemics. In addition, Intermediates\u2019 results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that any health epidemic harms the economy in general. If any natural disasters, health epidemics or other public safety concerns were to affect the locations where Intermediate operates, its operation may experience material disruptions, which may materially and adversely affect its stock trading platform business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIntermediate division\u2019s principal executive office and operations, through its operating subsidiaries, are located in China. We also plan to launch various platforms which are being built initially in China. Accordingly, MICT\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic, social conditions and government policies in China generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, such growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy, and the rate of growth has been slowing since 2012. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the PRC government or in the laws and regulations in China, could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely affect MICT\u2019s business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for MICT\u2019s services and adversely affect MICT\u2019s competitive position. COVID-19 had a severe and negative impact on Chinese and global economy in the first half of 2020. Whether this will lead to a prolonged downturn in the economy is still unknown. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our Intermediate division\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the PRC government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our Intermediate division\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe PRC legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to us.\nPRC laws and the PRC legal system in general may have a significant impact on our business operations in China. Although China\u2019s legal system has developed over the last several decades, PRC laws, regulations and legal requirements remain underdeveloped relative to the United States of America. Moreover, PRC laws and regulations change frequently and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. For example, the interpretation or enforcement of PRC laws and regulations may be subject to government rules or policies, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all. In addition, the relative inexperience of China\u2019s judiciary system in some cases may create uncertainty as to the outcome of litigation. These uncertainties could limit our ability to enforce certain legal or contractual rights or otherwise adversely affect our business and operations.\nFurthermore, due to the existence of unpublished rules and policies, and since newly issued PRC laws and regulations may have expected and unexpected retrospective effects, we may not be aware of a violation of certain PRC laws, regulations, policies or rules until after the event.\nThe complexities, uncertainties and rapid changes in PRC regulation of the Internet-related businesses and companies require significant resources for compliance.\nThe PRC government extensively regulates the Internet industries, including foreign ownership of, and the licensing and permit requirements pertaining to, companies doing business in the Internet industry. These laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations. Issues, risks and uncertainties relating to PRC regulation of these businesses include, but are not limited to, the following:\nThere are uncertainties relating to the regulation of the Internet-related businesses in China, including evolving licensing practices. This means that certain of our permits, licenses or operations may be subject to challenge, or we may fail to obtain permits or licenses that may be deemed necessary for operations.\nNew laws and regulations that regulate Internet activities, including operating online platforms for stock trading, oil and gas trading, or insurance brokerage may be promulgated. If these new laws and regulations are promulgated, additional licenses may be required for operations. If our operations do not comply with these new regulations after they become effective, or if we fail to obtain any licenses required under these new laws and regulations, MICT or its subsidiaries could be subject to penalties.\nThe principal regulation governing the operation of Internet insurance business is the Measures for the Regulation of Internet Insurance Business, or Regulation of Internet Insurance Business, promulgated by the CBIRC on December 7, 2020 and effective on February 1, 2021. There is no assurance that Intermediate would be able to meet all the requirements set forth under the Regulation of Internet Insurance Business and effectively operate an online insurance brokerage business. Please refer to \u201cRegulation of Internet Insurance Businesses.\u201d\nThe interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies and any new laws, regulations or policies relating to the Internet-related industries have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of companies in these industries. We cannot assure you that Intermediate had obtained all the permits or licenses required for conducting its business in China or will be able to maintain existing licenses or obtain any new licenses required under any new laws or regulations. There are also risks associated with being found in violation of existing or future laws and regulations given the uncertainty and complexity of China\u2019s regulation of these businesses.\nIn addition, new laws and regulations applicable to the Internet-related industries could be issued at the national or provincial level, or existing regulations could be interpreted more strictly. No assurance can be given that business on these industries in general or our services in particular will not be adversely impacted by further regulations. In particular, technical limitations on Internet use can also be developed or implemented. For example, restrictions can be implemented on personal Internet use in the workplace in general or access to Intermediate\u2019s sites in particular. All such regulations, restrictions and limitations could lead to a reduction of user activities or a loss of users, and restrict the types of products and services we may be able to offer in China, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in China.\nThe 2006 M&A Rules established complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it difficult to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory authorities promulgated the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestics Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201c2006 M&A Rules\u201d), which were later amended on June 22, 2009. The 2006 M&A Rules and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce, People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law of China requires that the anti-monopoly law enforcement authority shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In addition, the security review rules issued by the State Council that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise \u201cnational defense and security\u201d concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise \u201cnational security\u201d concerns are subject to strict review by the MOFCOM, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOFCOM or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of business in China.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of foreign currency out of China. Certain revenues may be received in RMB. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our or our partners\u2019 ability in China to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency-denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments, expenditures from trade related transactions and services-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from SAFE or its local branch is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future.\nFluctuations in exchange rates of the RMB could materially affect financial results.\nThe exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies are affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. The People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit fluctuations in RMB exchange rates and achieve policy goals.\nRegulation and censorship of information disseminated over the Internet in China may adversely affect our business, and may cause liability for content that is displayed on any of its websites.\nChina has enacted laws and regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of products, services, news, information, audio-video programs and other content through the Internet. In the past, the PRC government has prohibited the distribution of information through the Internet that it deems to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations. If any of Intermediate\u2019s Internet information on its online platforms is deemed by the PRC government to violate any content restrictions, we or our partners may not be able to continue to display such content and could become subject to penalties, including confiscation of income, fines, suspension of business and revocation of required licenses, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We or our partners may also be subjected to liability for any unlawful actions of their customers or users of their websites or for content distributed by such subsidiaries or partners that is deemed inappropriate. It may be difficult to determine the type of content that may result in liability.\nIt may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China.\nShareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests.\nUnder the enterprise income tax (\u201cEIT\u201d) Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences.\nUnder the EIT Law, which has been revised effective as of December 29, 2018, and its implementation rules, (the \u201cImplementation Rules\u201d), which has been revised and effective as April 23, 2019, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and is subject to enterprise income tax, or EIT, at the rate of 25% on its global income. The Implementation Rules define the term \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d as \u201cestablishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.\u201d The State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. Circular 82 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d with its \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d located within China if the following criteria are satisfied: (i) the place where the senior management and core management departments that are in charge of its daily operations perform their duties is mainly located in the PRC; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are made by or are subject to approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders\u2019 meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) more than half of the enterprise\u2019s directors or senior management with voting rights frequently reside in the PRC.\nCurrently, we do not believe we meet all of the criteria above. If the PRC authorities consider that we meet all of the criteria above and treat us as a resident enterprise, a 25% EIT on global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, even if we are not deemed as a resident enterprise by the PRC authorities, pursuant to the EIT Law, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and payable by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its foreign investors will be subject to a 10% withholding tax, unless any such foreign investor\u2019s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement and provided that relevant tax authorities approved the foreign investors as the beneficial owners of such dividends under applicable tax regulations.\nWe face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by non-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the China State Administration of Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d) issued the Circular on issues of enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfer of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprise, or the SAT Circular 7, pursuant to which if a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly by transfer of the equity interests of an offshore holding company (other than the purchase and sale of shares in public securities market) without a reasonable commercial purpose, the PRC tax authorities have the power to reassess the nature of the transaction and the indirect equity transfer might be treated as a direct transfer. As a result, the gain derived from such transfer, which means the equity transfer price minus the cost of equity, will be subject to the PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. SAT Circular 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets. Under the SAT Circular 7, the transfer which meets all of the following circumstances shall be deemed as having no reasonable commercial purpose: (i) over 75% of the value of the equity interests of the offshore holding company are directly or indirectly derived from PRC taxable properties; (ii) at any time during the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the total properties of the offshore holding company are investments within PRC territory, or in the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the offshore holding company\u2019s total income is directly or indirectly derived from within PRC territory; (iii) the function performed and risks assumed by the offshore holding company are insufficient to substantiate its corporate existence; or (iv) the foreign income tax imposed on the indirect transfer is lower than the PRC tax imposed on the direct transfer of the PRC taxable properties. In October 2017, SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Circular 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017 and was amended on June 15, 2018. The SAT Circular 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of nonresident enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which is an indirect transfer, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may report such indirect transfer to the relevant tax authority. Using a \u201csubstance over form\u201d principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions that involve PRC taxable assets, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments. We may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if we are transferors in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding obligations if we are transferees in such transactions, under SAT Circular 7 or SAT Circular 37, or both.\nThe enforcement of the PRC Labor Contract Law and other labor-related regulations in the PRC may adversely affect MICT\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress enacted the Labor Contract Law in 2008 and amended it on December 28, 2012. The Labor Contract Law introduced specific provisions related to fixed-term employment contracts, part-time employment, probationary periods, consultation with labor unions and employee assemblies, employment without a written contract, dismissal of employees, severance, and collective bargaining to enhance previous PRC labor laws. Under the Labor Contract Law, an employer is obligated to sign an unlimited-term labor contract with any employee who has worked for the employer for ten consecutive years. Further, if an employee requests or agrees to renew a fixed-term labor contract that has already been entered into twice consecutively, the resulting contract, with certain exceptions, must have an unlimited term, subject to certain exceptions. With certain exceptions, an employer must pay severance to an employee where a labor contract is terminated or expires. In the case of retrenching 20 or more employees or where the number of employees to be retrenched is less than 20 but comprises 10% or more of the total number of employees of such employer under certain circumstances, the employer shall explain the situation to the labor union or all staff 30 days in advance and seek the opinion of the labor union or the employees, the employer may carry out the retrenchment exercise upon reporting the retrenchment scheme to the labor administrative authorities. In addition, the PRC governmental authorities have continued to introduce various new labor-related regulations since the effectiveness of the Labor Contract Law.\nUnder the PRC Social Insurance Law and the Administrative Measures on Housing Fund, employees are required to participate in pension insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, and housing funds and employers are required, together with their employees or separately, to pay the social insurance premiums and housing funds for their employees. If we fail to make adequate social insurance and housing fund contributions, or fail to withhold individual income tax adequately, we may be subject to fines and legal sanctions, and our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThese laws designed to enhance labor protection tend to increase our labor costs. In addition, as the interpretation and implementation of these regulations are still evolving, our employment practices may not be at all times be deemed in compliance with the regulations. As a result, we could be subject to penalties or incur significant liabilities in connection with labor disputes or investigations.\nPRC regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC-resident beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries or limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits.\nSAFE promulgated the SAFE Circular 37 on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as \u201cSAFE Circular 75\u201d promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 and its implementing rules require PRC residents to register with banks designated by local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with the PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d\nWe notified substantial beneficial owners of ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and pursuant to the former SAFE Circular 75, we filed the above-mentioned foreign exchange registration on behalf of certain employee shareholders who we know are PRC residents. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. We do not have control over our beneficial owners, and there can be no assurance that all of our PRC-resident beneficial owners will comply with relevant SAFE regulations. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules, may subject the beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions.\nFurthermore, since it is unclear how those SAFE regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be further interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to our company. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding our employee equity incentive plans may subject the PRC participants in the plans, us or our overseas and PRC subsidiaries to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.\nPursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may, prior to the exercise of an option, submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In the meantime, our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens residing in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to limited exceptions, and whom we or our overseas listed subsidiaries have granted restricted share units, or RSUs, options or restricted shares, may follow the Notice on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly Listed Company, issued by SAFE in February 2012, to apply for the foreign exchange registration. According to those regulations, employees, directors and other management members participating in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to limited exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures. Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit their ability to make payment under the relevant equity incentive plans or receive dividends or sales proceeds related thereto in foreign currencies, or our ability to contribute additional capital into our domestic subsidiaries in China and limit our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to us. We also face regulatory uncertainties under PRC law that could restrict our ability or the ability of our overseas listed subsidiaries to adopt additional equity incentive plans for our directors and employees who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens residing in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to limited exceptions.\nIn addition, the STA has issued circulars concerning employee RSUs, share options or restricted shares. Under these circulars, employees working in the PRC whose RSUs or restricted shares vest, or who exercise share options, will be subject to PRC individual income tax. The PRC subsidiaries of an overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee RSUs, share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees related to their RSUs, share options or restricted shares. Although we and our overseas listed subsidiaries currently withhold individual income tax from our PRC employees in connection with the vesting of their RSUs and restricted shares and their exercise of options, if the employees fail to pay, or the PRC subsidiaries fail to withhold, their individual income taxes according to relevant laws, rules and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities.\nDiscontinuation of preferential tax treatments we currently enjoy or other unfavorable changes in tax law could result in additional compliance obligations and costs.\nChinese companies operating in the high-technology and software industry that meet relevant requirements may qualify for three main types of preferential treatment, which are high and new technology enterprises, software enterprises and key software enterprises within the scope of the PRC national plan. For a qualified high and new technology enterprise, the applicable enterprise income tax rate is 15%. The high and new technology enterprise qualification is re-assessed by the relevant authorities every three years. Moreover, a qualified software enterprise is entitled to a tax holiday consisting of a two-year tax exemption beginning from the first profit-making calendar year and a 50% tax reduction for the subsequent three calendar years. The software enterprise qualification is subject to an annual assessment. For a qualified key software enterprise within the scope of the PRC national plan, the applicable enterprise tax rate for a calendar year is 10%. The key software enterprise qualification is subject to an annual assessment.\nA number of our China operating entities take advantage of these preferential tax treatments. The discontinuation of any of the various types of preferential tax treatment that we take advantage of could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our auditor is sanctioned or otherwise penalized by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) or the SEC as a result of failure to comply with inspection or investigation requirements, our financial statements could be determined to be not in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act or other laws or rules in the United States, which could ultimately result in our Common Stock being delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur auditor is required under U.S. law to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. Our auditor is located in Israel and has been inspected and continues to be subject to PCAOB inspection. However, without approval from the Chinese government authorities, the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms within the PRC on a basis comparable to other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Since we have substantial operations in the PRC, if we utilize the services of our auditor\u2019s China based firm or various other auditors located in China, such auditors and their audit work are currently not fully inspected by the PCAOB.\nInspections of other auditors conducted by the PCAOB outside of China have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct full inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections.\nThe SEC previously instituted proceedings against mainland Chinese affiliates of the numerous accounting firms, including the affiliate of our auditor, for failing to produce audit work papers under Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because of restrictions under PRC law. Each of the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms in mainland China agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and stay the proceedings for four years, until the proceedings were deemed dismissed with prejudice on February 6, 2019. It remains unclear whether the SEC will commence a new administrative proceeding against the four mainland China-based accounting firms. Any such new proceedings or similar action against our audit firm for failure to provide access to audit work papers could result in the imposition of penalties, such as suspension of our auditor\u2019s ability to practice before the SEC. If our independent registered public accounting firm, or its affiliate, was denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC, and it was determined that our financial statements or audit reports were not in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, we could be at risk of delisting or become subject to other penalties that would adversely affect our ability to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn recent years, U.S. regulators have continued to express their concerns about challenges in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. More recently, as part of increased regulatory focus in the U.S. on access to audit information, on May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCA Act, which includes requirements for the SEC to identify issuers whose audit reports are prepared by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a restriction imposed by a non-U.S. authority in the auditor\u2019s local jurisdiction. While we understand that there has been dialogue among the CSRC, the SEC and the PCAOB regarding the inspection of PCAOB-registered accounting firms in China, there can be no assurance that our auditor or us will be able to comply with requirements imposed by U.S. regulators.\nFurthermore, on June 4, 2020, the U.S. President issued a memorandum ordering the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets to submit a report to the President within 60 days of the memorandum that includes recommendations for actions that can be taken by the executive branch, the SEC, the PCAOB or other federal agencies and departments with respect to Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges and their audit firms, in an effort to protect investors in the United States. The recommendations are to include actions that could be taken under current laws and rules as well as possible new rulemaking recommendations.\nOn May 20, 2020, the HFCAA passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent. On December 2, 2020, the US House of Representatives passed by voice vote the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), which would require auditors of foreign public companies to allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect their audit work papers for audits of non-US operations as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley). If a company\u2019s auditors fail to comply for three consecutive years, then the Company\u2019s shares would be prohibited from trading in the United States. The legislation passed the Senate in May. The HFCAA was signed into law on December 18, 2020.\nThe HFCAA aims to address restrictions China has placed on the PCAOB\u2019s ability to inspect or investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in connection with their audits of Chinese companies. Sarbanes-Oxley created the PCAOB \u201cto oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws, and related matters, in order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports for companies the securities of which are sold to, and held by and for, public investors.\u201d Specifically, the PCAOB is responsible for registering public accounting firms, establishing standards applicable to the preparation of audit reports for companies, conducting inspections and investigations of public accounting firms to ensure they are complying with those standards, and bringing enforcement actions when they are not.\nThe HFCAA could adversely affect the listing and compliance status of China-based issuers listed in the United States, such as our company, and may have a material and adverse impact on the trading prices of the securities of such issuers, including our Common Stock, and substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our Common Stock in the United States.\nRisk Factors Relating to Micronet\u2019s Business and Industry\nPotential political, economic and military instability in Israel could adversely affect operations.\nCertain of MICT and Micronet\u2019s principal offices and operating facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, with respect to such Israeli facilities, political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect the operations of MICT and Micronet. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been an increase in hostilities between Israel and Palestinians, which has adversely affected the peace process and has negatively influenced Israel\u2019s relationship with its Arab citizens and several Arab countries, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Lebanon and Syria. Such ongoing hostilities may hinder Israel\u2019s international trade relations and may limit the geographic markets where Micronet can sell its products and solutions. Hostilities involving or threatening Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could materially and adversely affect operations.\nIn addition, Israel-based companies and companies doing business with Israel have been subject to an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel\u2019s establishment, along with other private organizations around the world. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved is unpredictable. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment.\nThe Israeli identity of certain of Micronet\u2019s products may adversely affect its ability to sell its products and/or solutions.\nThe sale of Micronet\u2019s products is affected in certain countries and may be affected in other countries by the international status of the State of Israel. Israeli identity may be used in some cases for promoting sales (in light of the recognition of the technological advantages that exist in Israel) whereas in other cases and is likely to continue to be a disadvantage and result in the cancellation of transactions.\nMicronet\u2019s operations may be disrupted as a result of the obligation of management or key personnel to perform military service.\nMicronet\u2019s employees and consultants in Israel, including members of its senior management, may be obligated to perform one month, and in some cases longer periods, of military reserve duty until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for citizens who hold certain positions in the Israeli armed forces reserves) and, in the event of a military conflict or emergency circumstances, may be called to immediate and unlimited active duty. In the event of severe unrest or other conflict, individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists. It is possible that there will be similar large-scale military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Micronet\u2019s operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of our officers, directors, employees and consultants related to military service. Such disruption could materially adversely affect Micronet\u2019s business and operations.\nUnder current Israeli law, the Company and Micronet may not be able to enforce our respective Israeli employees\u2019 covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our respective former employees.\nPreviously, the Company and Micronet entered, and the Company and Micronet may plan in the future to enter into, non-competition agreements with our key employees, in most cases within the framework of their employment agreements. These agreements prohibit our key employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. Under applicable Israeli law, the Company and Micronet may be unable to enforce these agreements or any part thereof against our Israeli employees. If the Company and Micronet cannot enforce its non-competition agreements against their respective Israeli employees, then the Company and Micronet may be unable to prevent their competitors from benefiting from the expertise of these former employees, which could impair the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and ability to capitalize on Micronet\u2019s proprietary information.\nIf Micronet is unable to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce, then it may not be able to meet the needs of customers in the future.\nVirtually all of the products produced and sold by Micronet are highly engineered and require employees with sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The markets and industry in which Micronet operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The products, systems, solutions and needs of Micronet customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, the future performance of Micronet depends on its ability to develop and manufacture competitive products and solutions, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. In addition, because of the highly specialized nature of Micronet\u2019s business, the hiring and retention of skilled and qualified personnel is necessary to perform the services required by customers. If Micronet is unable to develop new products that meet customers\u2019 changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, its future revenues and earnings may be adversely affected, and therefore the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet may be adversely affected.\nDeveloping new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may cause Micronet to incur significant costs and could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows, and as a result thereof, adversely affect the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nA significant portion of Micronet\u2019s business relates to developing sophisticated products and applications. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, Micronet may incur significant liabilities that are unique to its products and services. While Micronet maintains insurance for some business risks, there is no guarantee that the insurance policies currently in place, or as may be added from time to time, will be sufficient to cover all risks or liabilities that may be incurred. Accordingly, Micronet may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of its products and products under development, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition and/or cash flows, and therefore the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet may be adversely affected.\nIf Micronet is unable to effectively protect proprietary technology, its business and competitive position may be harmed, which would have an adverse effect on MICT\u2019s business and financial position.\nMicronet\u2019s success and ability to compete is dependent on its proprietary technology. The steps Micronet has taken to protect its proprietary rights may not be adequate and Micronet may not be able to prevent others from using its proprietary technology. The methodologies and proprietary technology that constitute the basis of Micronet\u2019s solutions and products are not protected by patents. Existing trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure agreements to which Micronet is a party offer only limited protection. Therefore, others, including Micronet\u2019s competitors, may develop and market similar solutions and products, copy or reverse engineer elements of Micronet\u2019s production lines, or engage in the unauthorized use of Micronet\u2019s intellectual property. Any misappropriation of Micronet\u2019s proprietary technology or the development of competitive technology may have a significant adverse effect on Micronet\u2019s ability to compete and may harm the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by its employees, which could result in litigation and harm our business.\nA significant portion of the intellectual property covered by Micronet\u2019s products has been developed by Micronet\u2019s employees in the course of their employment for Micronet. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967, or the Patent Law, and recent decisions by the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, Israeli employees may be entitled to remuneration for intellectual property that they develop for us unless they explicitly waive any such rights. To the extent that Micronet is unable to enter into agreements with its future employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are owned exclusively by Micronet (as it has done in the past), Micronet may face claims demanding remuneration. As a consequence of such claims, Micronet could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to its current and former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect its own and our business.\nSubstantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights may be incurred, which would have an adverse effect on the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nThird parties may challenge the validity of Micronet\u2019s intellectual property rights or bring claims regarding Micronet\u2019s infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. This may result in costly litigation or other time-consuming and expensive judicial or administrative proceedings, which could deprive Micronet of valuable rights, cause them to incur substantial expenses and cause a diversion for technical and management personnel. An adverse determination may subject Micronet to significant liabilities or require it to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims are proven valid, through litigation or otherwise, Micronet may be required to pay substantial financial damages or be required to discontinue or significantly delay the development, marketing, sale or licensing of the affected products and intellectual property rights. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nEarnings and margins may be negatively impacted if Micronet is unable to perform under its contracts.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, Micronet\u2019s management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. These projections assess:\n\u25cf the productivity and availability of labor;\n\u25cf the complexity of the work to be performed;\n\u25cf the cost and availability of materials;\n\u25cf the impact of delayed performance; and\n\u25cf the timing of product deliveries.\nIf there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if faced with unexpected contract costs, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected and could affect, among other things, earnings and margins, due to the fact that Micronet\u2019s contracts are often made on a fixed-price basis.\nEarnings and margins could be negatively affected by deficient subcontractor performance or the unavailability of raw materials or components.\nMicronet\u2019s operations rely on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for its products. Subcontractors perform some of the services that Micronet provides to its customers. Micronet\u2019s operations depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Occasionally, Micronet relies on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on Micronet\u2019s ability to meet commitments to customers. Micronet\u2019s ability to perform its obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Further, deficiencies in the performance of subcontractors and vendors could result in a customer terminating a contract for default. A termination for default could expose Micronet to liability and adversely affect financial performance and Micronet\u2019s ability to win new contracts, and in turn, adversely affect the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet is dependent on major customers for a significant portion of revenues, and therefore, future revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted by the loss or reduction of the demand for Micronet\u2019s products or services by such customers.\nA significant portion of MRM annual revenues are derived from a few leading customers. Most of Micronet\u2019s major customers do not have any obligation to purchase additional products or services from it. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any of Micronet\u2019s leading customers will continue to purchase solutions, products or services at levels comparable to previous years. A substantial loss or reduction in Micronet\u2019s existing major customers could adversely affect future revenues and earnings and in turn, adversely affect the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet operates in a highly competitive and fragmented market and may not be able to maintain a competitive position in the future. Any such failure to successfully compete could have a material adverse effect on the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nA number of large competitors operate the MRM market in which Micronet operates. These large companies have far greater development and capital resources than Micronet. Further, there are competitors of Micronet that offer solutions, products and services similar to those offered by Micronet. If they continue, these trends could undermine Micronet\u2019s competitive strength and position and adversely affect earnings and financial condition, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet may cease to be eligible for, or receive reduced, tax benefits under Israeli law, which could negatively impact profits in the future.\nMicronet currently receives certain tax benefits under the Israeli Law Encouragement of Capital Investments of 1959, as a result of the designation of its production facility as an \u201cApproved Enterprise.\u201d To maintain their eligibility for these tax benefits, Micronet must continue to meet several conditions including, among others, generating more than 25% of its gross revenues outside the State of Israel and continuing to qualify as an \u201cIndustrial Company\u201d under Israeli tax law. An Industrial Company, according to the applicable Israeli law (Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969), is a company that resides in Israel (either incorporated in Israel or managed and controlled from Israel) that, during the relevant tax year, derives at least 90% of its income from an Industrial Factory. An Industrial Factory means a factory that is owned by an Industrial Company and where its manufacturing operations constitute a vast majority of the factory\u2019s total operations/business. The tax benefits of qualifying as an Industrial Company include a reduction of the corporate tax from 24% for \u201cRegular Entities\u201d and 16% or 7.5% for \u201cPreferred Enterprises\u201d (depending on the location of industry) in 2017. In addition, in recent years the Israeli government has reduced the benefits available under this program and has indicated that it may further reduce or eliminate benefits in the future. There is no assurance that Micronet will continue to qualify for these tax benefits or that such tax benefits will continue to be available. The termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase the amount of tax payable by Micronet and, accordingly, reduce MICT\u2019s net profit after tax and negatively impact profits, if any, which may adversely affect the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet is subject to regulations in the United States and Europe, which if failed to be met, could negatively impact Micronet\u2019s and MICT\u2019s business and reputation.\nMicronet\u2019s business is subject to certain international standards such as U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15B, FCC ID, CE and Restriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, which define compatibility of interface and telecommunications standards to those implemented in the United States by the FCC and in Europe by the European Commission, respectively. Micronet\u2019s solutions and products also need to comply with the E-Mark European standard, which is the standard that defines the compatibility of interface and telecommunications to all appliances installed in and around an automobile. Micronet is exposed to risks from regulators, arising from Micronet\u2019s failure to comply with the aforementioned international standards, which define interface and communication standards, compliance with the standards of the European Common Market, European Conformity, or the CE, and the requirements of the U.S. Communications Regulatory Commission, the FCC, inclusive of the ELD mandate. If Micronet does not adhere to these international standards, Micronet may be limited in marketing its products in such markets, and face fines and/or risks to both MICT\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s reputation, and which may also adversely affect MICT\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s future revenues and earnings and the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nProvisions of Israeli law and Micronet\u2019s amended and restated articles of association may delay, prevent or otherwise impede a merger with, or an acquisition of, our company, which could prevent a change of control, even when the terms of such a transaction are favorable to Micronet and its shareholders.\nAs a company incorporated under the law of the State of Israel, Micronet is subject to Israeli corporate law. Israeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors, officers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to such types of transactions. For example, a merger may not be consummated unless at least 50 days have passed from the date on which a merger proposal is filed by each merging company with the Israel Registrar of Companies and at least 30 days have passed from the date on which the shareholders of both merging companies have approved the merger. In addition, a majority of each class of securities of the target company must approve a merger. Moreover, a tender offer for all of a company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares can only be completed if the acquirer receives positive responses from the holders of at least 95% of the issued share capital. Completion of the tender offer also requires approval of and a majority of the offerees that do not have a personal interest in the tender offer approves the tender offer, unless, following consummation of the tender offer, the acquirer would hold at least 98% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares. Furthermore, the shareholders, including those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer, may, at any time within six months following the completion of the tender offer, claim that the consideration for the acquisition of the shares does not reflect their fair market value, and petition an Israeli court to alter the consideration for the acquisition, unless accordingly, other than those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer in case the acquirer stipulated in its tender offer that a shareholder that accepts the offer may not seek such appraisal rights., and the acquirer or the Company published all required information with respect to the tender offer prior to the tender offer\u2019s response date.\nFurthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to Micronet or to its shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax treaty with Israel exempting such shareholders from Israeli tax.\nMicronet\u2019s amended and restated articles of association also contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in its management without the consent of its board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority shareholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u25cf the right of Micronet\u2019s board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which may prevent shareholders from being able to fill vacancies on its board of directors.", "PERMNO": 13879, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "MICT"}
