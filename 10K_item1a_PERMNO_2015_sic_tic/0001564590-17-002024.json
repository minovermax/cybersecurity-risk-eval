Certain important factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in 2006. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $28.7 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $150.8 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the completion of our IPO, our underwritten public offering of common stock in the first quarter of 2017, private placements of our convertible preferred securities prior to our IPO, certain debt-related financing arrangements and from sales of our products. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our products, clinical and regulatory initiatives to obtain clearances or approvals for our products, sales and marketing activities and operating as a public company. Our ability to generate sufficient revenue from our existing products or from any of our products in development, to transition to profitability and generate consistent positive cash flows, is uncertain. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we continue to build our commercial infrastructure, and develop, enhance and commercialize new products. In addition, while some of our new and ancillary products add to our revenues, they may carry smaller gross margins than our traditional balloon sinus dilation products, which also may hinder our path to profitability. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. Furthermore, even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis. If we do not achieve profitability, it will be more difficult for us to finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives.\nWe may be unable to sustain our historical revenue growth.\nOur revenue from sales of our sinus dilation balloon devices has grown in each of the fiscal years since we began commercialization in 2008. Historically, we have experienced significant revenue growth but we may not achieve similar growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future operating performance. Our ability to increase our revenue in future periods at our historical growth rates, or at all, will depend primarily on our ability to increase sales of our sinus dilation balloon devices and other products, which, in turn, will depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and reorders from those customers. We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenue from our sinus dilation balloon devices or other products on a quarterly or annual basis. If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our operating results may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed due to our manufacturing, research and development, and sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a shortfall relative to our anticipated revenue could magnify the adverse impact of such shortfalls on our results of operations.\nPricing pressure from our competitors, customers and changes in third-party coverage and reimbursement may adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our operating results.\nCompetition in our industry has increased as a result of new market entrants, new technologies and as more established companies have intensified competitive pricing pressure. As a result of these competitive forces, we believe there will continue to be pricing pressure in the future. Because our products are generally purchased by ENT physician offices, ASCs and hospitals and billed to various third-party payors, changes in the purchasing behavior of such customers or the amount such payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products, including as a result of healthcare reform initiatives, could create additional pricing pressure on us. In addition to these competitive forces, we continue to see pricing pressure as our customers introduce new pricing structures into their contracts and agreements, including fixed price formulas, capitated pricing and structured pricing intended to contain healthcare costs. Such trends may adversely affect demand for our products and may drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products, both of which would negatively affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage or reimbursement for the procedures using our products, or any future products we may seek to commercialize, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\nHospital, physician and other healthcare provider customers, including ASC customers that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which our products are used\nand bill patients for any deductibles or co-payments. In the hospital and ASC settings, our products are often used in a hybrid procedure in conjunction with traditional FESS. Because there is often no separate reimbursement for supplies used in surgical procedures, and with respect to FESS, no separate reimbursement for balloon sinus dilation, the additional cost associated with the use of our products in these settings can impact the profit margin of the hospital or surgery center where the hybrid procedure is performed. Some of our target customers may be unwilling to adopt our products in light of the additional associated cost. Further, any decline in the amount payors are willing to reimburse our customers for balloon sinus dilation procedures in either the office or facility setting could make it difficult for existing customers to continue using or to adopt our products and could create additional pricing pressure for us. Medicare has issued a final rule on the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, or OPPS, for 2017 which includes a reduction of payments for certain outpatient procedures performed in the hospital when FESS is performed on more than two sinuses. The result is to bundle payments for multi-sinus surgery regardless of the number of sinuses being treated. On average we expect most hospitals will experience a reduction in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, reimbursement because on average more than two sinuses are treated in a hospital sinus surgery procedure. As a result of this final rule, the portion of our business in which we sell to a hospital may suffer. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our products, our gross margins will decrease, which will materially adversely affect our business.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new and existing technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny or reverse coverage or alter pre-authorization requirements for new or existing products and procedures. Additionally, some third-party payors do not currently cover or reimburse balloon sinus dilation procedures because they have determined insufficient evidence of favorable clinical outcomes is available. We are actively working to avoid or to reverse these non-coverage decisions, as applicable, but cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. If we are not successful in reversing existing non-coverage policies, or if third-party payors that currently cover or reimburse balloon sinus dilation procedures reverse or limit their coverage in the future, or if other third-party payors issue similar policies, this could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions and payment reductions, such as additional preauthorization requirements, adoption by private health insurance companies of lower payments related to the 2017 CMS Hospital Outpatient Payment Rule converting Medicare patients undergoing FESS procedures performed in the hospital on more than two sinuses, transitioning hospital outpatient payments for FESS to comprehensive APCs per the 2017 CMS Hospital Outpatient Payment Rule thereby lowering average reimbursement levels for Medicare patients and tightening coverage criteria by Medicare. In addition, Medicare may further reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products when performed in the physician office setting or ASCs, which could cause the portion of our business in which we sell to physician offices and ASCs to suffer. In addition, commercial payors may use Medicare rates and/or coverage criteria as a reference for establishing their own payment rates and coverage criteria. Accordingly, any reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates or increase in coverage restrictions could result in lower commercial reimbursement for our products and tighter coverage requirements with commercial payors as well. Such changes in reimbursement or coverage could negatively impact our revenues and our business. Moreover, third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products or any of our products in development for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAggregation of purchasing from collaboration and consolidation may lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain market opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has intensified and may continue to do so. This in turn has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures or the exclusion of certain suppliers from certain market opportunities as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions. In addition, such consolidation may lead these organizations to limit their number of suppliers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to impact the healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur revenue is primarily generated from our XprESS family of multi-sinus products; and, therefore, we are highly dependent on a limited number of products.\nWe began selling our XprESS family of products in 2010, and these products accounted for more than 80% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Although we expect sales from new products to increase in future periods, we expect that sales of our XprESS family of products will continue to account for the substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Therefore, our ability to execute our growth strategy and become profitable will depend not only upon a continued shift of more sinus procedures from traditional operating room settings to the ENT physician office setting, but also to the adoption of our XprESS family of products to perform those procedures. Some ENT physicians may have prior history with or preference for a competitor\u2019s balloon sinus dilation products or be reluctant to alter practice patterns and undergo training required to use our products. If our XprESS products fail to achieve wide market acceptance for any reason, our business may be adversely affected.\nIf physicians or patients are not willing to change current practices or adopt office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures, our products may fail to gain increased market acceptance, and our business will suffer.\nOur primary strategy to grow revenue is to drive an increase in office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures, the adoption of our XprESS family of products to perform these procedures and the use of our other related products. While the number of ENT physicians performing sinus procedures using office-based balloon sinus dilation has increased in recent years, there is a significant group of ENT physicians who have not yet adopted these procedures, and additional ENT physicians may not adopt office-based balloon sinus dilation for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nlack of significant experience with balloon sinus dilation as a treatment alternative;\n\u2022\nlack of availability of adequate insurance coverage or reimbursement or stringent requirements for reimbursement for office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures;\n\u2022\nperceived inadequacy of evidence supporting clinical benefits or cost-effectiveness of office-based balloon sinus dilation over existing alternatives; and\n\u2022\na perception among some ENT physicians of patients\u2019 inability to tolerate balloon sinus dilation procedures in the physician office setting.\nIf additional ENT physicians do not continue to adopt, or existing ENT physicians cease using, office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures for any reason, including those listed above, our ability to execute our growth strategy would be impaired, and our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe believe recommendations and support of our products by notable ENT physicians can influence market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive support from these influential ENT physicians, our ability to achieve broad market acceptance for our products may be impaired.\nIn addition, if patient receptivity toward treatment in an ENT physician office setting becomes less favorable in the future, this shift could negatively impact market acceptance of our products. Any negative change due to patient receptivity could also be compounded by patients reporting to physicians or other patients through word-of-mouth or social media.\nAdditionally, while it is currently more cost-effective to the healthcare system for providers to perform balloon sinus dilation in an ENT physician\u2019s office than a FESS procedure in the operating room, healthcare economics are always subject to change. If the use of our balloon sinus dilation products were to cease being more cost-effective than FESS due to changes in reimbursement economics, our products may fail to gain market acceptance, our future growth would be limited and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, if payment rates for office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures were to be lowered, in particular by Medicare, would likely then cause other third-party payors to implement comparable reductions to their reimbursement rates, ENT physicians may reduce the frequency of balloon sinus dilation procedures and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe compete and may compete in the future against other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products or greater resources than we do, which may prevent us from achieving increased market penetration or improved operating results.\nOur industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. We believe competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to treat sinusitis. We currently compete against companies providing alternative treatments to balloon sinus dilation, as well as companies that provide competing balloon sinus dilation products, as well as other competing products. For example, the Xomed division of Medtronic sells a balloon sinus dilation device that competes with our XprESS family of products. Additionally, Intersect ENT is currently developing products for office-based treatment of sinusitis, which if approved may be competitive with us in the future. Many of the companies developing or marketing these ENT products are publicly traded or are divisions of publicly traded companies, including the Xomed division of Medtronic, the Acclarent division of\nJohnson & Johnson and the ArthroCare division of Smith & Nephew, each of which produces competing balloon sinus dilation products and other competing products, and the Gyrus ACMI division of Olympus, Stryker Corporation and Intersect ENT, each of which produces tools and devices for FESS. These companies may enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human capital resources;\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022\ncontrol of key intellectual property, which could impact future products under development;\n\u2022\nestablished relationships with ENT physicians, suppliers, referring physicians, customers and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nadditional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and\n\u2022\nmore established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks.\nTo a lesser extent, we also have faced, and may in the future face, competition from pharmaceutical companies that develop medical therapies to treat sinusitis. In addition, substantially all of the products we manufacture are designed to be used exclusively during balloon sinus dilation or FESS procedures. If another company successfully develops an approach for the treatment of chronic sinusitis that would not benefit from the use of our products, or if another company develops a balloon sinus dilation device that is more efficacious, more cost-effective or easier to use than our products, sales of our products could be significantly and adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our license agreement with Acclarent, which exposes us to a variety of risks.\nWe are a party to a license agreement, or the Acclarent License, with Acclarent. Under the Acclarent License, Acclarent has granted us a non-exclusive license under patents held by Acclarent to manufacture, use and commercialize our XprESS, PathAssist and FinESS products and certain future versions of those products, or, collectively, the Covered Products. We have certain obligations under the Acclarent License, including paying Acclarent a royalty on the sale of Covered Products. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the Acclarent License, Acclarent may terminate the Acclarent License, in which case our current products would no longer enjoy a license under Acclarent\u2019s patents. Without the license, Acclarent might successfully enforce its patents against us based on the sale of our current products, possibly resulting in our being ordered to pay Acclarent monetary damages and/or in our being enjoined from selling our current products within any country where Acclarent has a valid and enforceable claim covering a given product. Furthermore, because the Acclarent License is non-exclusive, Acclarent could choose to also license the same intellectual property to other third-party competitors. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we do not control the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the Acclarent License. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted or enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If Acclarent fails to maintain the patents it has licensed to us under the Acclarent License, or loses its rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, which could severely harm our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to continue to develop and commercialize additional ENT products.\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change and technological advancements. Therefore, it is important to our business that we continue to enhance our product offerings and introduce new products. Developing products is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our core balloon sinus dilation business. However, if we are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing new products, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired. Even if we are successful in developing additional products, the success of any new product offering or enhancements to existing products will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate ENT physician and patient needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely but controlled manner;\n\u2022\navoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022\nbe fully FDA-compliant with marketing of new devices or modified products;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training to potential users of our products;\n\u2022\nobtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our customers performing procedures using our products; and\n\u2022\ndevelop an effective and dedicated sales and marketing team.\nThe launch of new products if not timed correctly and if not controlled properly may result in an adverse impact on sales of such new products, as well as sales of our core balloon sinus dilation products. In addition, our new products may not carry the same margins as our core balloon sinus dilation products, which adversely affected our gross margins during the second half of 2016 and could adversely affect our future gross margins.\nOur future growth depends on physician awareness and adoption of our balloon sinus dilation devices and ancillary products.\nWe focus our sales, marketing and training efforts on ENT physicians. However, the initial point of contact for many patients suffering from chronic sinusitis may be primary care physicians or other referring medical professionals, such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants, who commonly see patients with sinus infections and sinusitis and prescribe pharmaceuticals to address sinusitis symptoms. We believe that education of primary care physicians and other medical professionals about the clinical merits and patient benefits of office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures is an important element of the growth of office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures. If we fail to educate primary care physicians and other medical professionals, they may not refer sinusitis patients to an ENT physician to perform balloon sinus dilation procedures and, as a result, those patients may continue to receive only medical management. If this were to occur, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired.\nAlthough efficacy of our products has been demonstrated in clinical studies sponsored by us, insurance companies who do not cover stand-alone balloon sinus dilation may require additional or independently performed clinical studies prior to adopting or covering or maintaining coverage of procedures in which our products are used as a stand-alone therapy.\nOur success depends on the medical and third-party payor communities\u2019 acceptance of our products as tools that are useful to ENT physicians treating patients with chronic sinusitis. We have sponsored one meta-data analysis and eight clinical studies with over 600 patients to track outcomes of treatment with our products. While the results of these studies, collectively indicate that our products can be used to successfully treat uncomplicated chronic sinusitis equally effectively as FESS while also providing better recovery outcomes, if physicians or insurers do not find our data compelling or wish to wait for additional or independently performed studies, they may choose not to use or provide coverage and reimbursement for our products. Currently, we estimate there are insurance plans, including a number of large third-party payors, covering approximately 75 million lives that have determined balloon sinus dilation to be investigational and therefore do not cover it at this time.\nIn addition, the long-term effects of balloon sinus dilation with our products beyond 24 months are not known. Certain ENT physicians, hospitals, ASCs and insurers may prefer to see longer-term efficacy data than we have produced. We cannot make any assurances that any data that we or others generate will be consistent with that observed in our existing clinical studies.\nIt is difficult to forecast future performance and our financial results may vary from forecasts and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur limited operating history and commercial experience make it difficult for us to predict future performance. A number of factors over which we have limited control, such as seasonal variations in revenue, may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results. In the first quarter, our results can be impacted by adverse weather and by resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, both of which may cause patients to delay elective procedures in which our products are used. In the second quarter, demand may be increased by the seasonal nature of allergies and the resultant onset of sinus-related symptoms. In the third quarter, we believe the number of elective surgeries and particularly FESS or balloon sinus dilation procedures nationwide is historically lower than other quarters as a result of summer vacations of ENT physicians and their patients. In the fourth quarter, demand typically increases with the onset of the cold and flu season and related symptoms, as well as the desire of patients to spend the remaining balances in their flexible-spending accounts or because of lower out-of-pocket costs to patients who have already met their annual deductibles under their health insurance plans.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our revenue and gross profit among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nENT physician adoption of our products;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nunanticipated pricing pressure;\n\u2022\nthe hiring, retention and continued productivity of our sales representatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our products in development or for our current products outside the United States and the timing thereof;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development;\n\u2022\ncosts and benefits of new product introductions;\n\u2022\nthe number and mix of products sold in the quarter and the geographies in which they are sold;\n\u2022\nthe demand for, and pricing of, our products and the products of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition;\n\u2022\nthe timing and extent of promotional pricing or volume discounts;\n\u2022\nchanges in average selling prices;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndelays in receipt of anticipated purchase orders;\n\u2022\ndelays in, or failure of, component and raw material deliveries by our suppliers; and\n\u2022\npositive or negative coverage in the media or clinical publications of our products or products of our competitors or our industry.\nAdditionally, we typically receive orders and ship a significant amount of product toward the end of each quarter. If these orders or shipments get delayed, this could adversely affect our quarterly revenues.\nIn the event our actual revenue and operating results do not meet our forecasts or the forecasts or estimates of the research analysts that cover us for a particular period, the market price of our common stock may decline substantially.\nWe recently acquired and entered into an exclusive license for the XeroGel\u2122 assets with CogENT Therapeutics, LLC. We may be unable to successfully integrate the manufacturing of XeroGel in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner. In addition, acquisitions are risky and may harm our business and operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures and advances in technologies. Accordingly, we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of, or joint ventures relating to, complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions; our ability to compete effectively for acquisition candidates; and the availability of capital and personnel to complete such acquisitions and run the acquired business effectively. We do not know if we will be able to successfully complete any future acquisitions or joint ventures. There are risks and uncertainties involved in this recent acquisition and any future acquisitions we may complete including:\n\u2022\nthe integration may take longer, be more difficult, time-consuming or costly to accomplish than expected;\n\u2022\nbusiness disruption and distraction after the transaction, including adverse effects on employee retention;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\ninability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\n\u2022\nreallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay acquisition purchase prices or other costs, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize intended benefits from the transaction or delay in realization thereof;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of post-acquisition liabilities and costs, including undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\n\u2022\nincorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill or other assets that could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn June 2016, we acquired and entered into an exclusive license for the XeroGel assets with CogENT Therapeutics, LLC. In connection with the acquisition, we became the manufacturer of XeroGel nasal packing material and will continue to market and sell XeroGel material to hospitals, offices and ASCs. We are in the process of transferring XeroGel manufacturing to our Plymouth facilities, which transfer may not be completed smoothly.\nManagement has made certain assumptions related to the XeroGel acquisition including those related to projections of future revenue and the amount of goodwill and intangible assets purchased. While management has made these assumptions in good faith and believes them to be reasonable, the assumptions may turn out to be materially inaccurate, including for reasons beyond our control. If these assumptions are incorrect we may change or modify them, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Given the timing of the XeroGel acquisition, the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired as of June 30, 2016 was preliminary and subject to change. During the measurement period, we have recorded adjustments to the assets acquired. Intangible assets increased from $6.4 million to $10.2 million, excluding amortization, and goodwill decreased from $4.3 million to $0.5 million. We may continue to assess and refine the purchase price allocation through the end of the measurement period, which, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, should not exceed one year from the date of the XeroGel acquisition.\nAdditionally, we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with the XeroGel acquisition. On an ongoing basis, we will evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the value of intangible assets. As circumstances change, we cannot assure you that the value of these intangible assets will be realized by us. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we will be required to write-off the impaired portion of intangible assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.\nFinally, some acquisitions may require the consent of the lender under our credit facility and we cannot predict whether the lender or future lenders would approve such acquisitions or the terms on which the lender would approve any such acquisitions. These and other risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a relatively short period of time.\nThe size of the market for balloon sinus dilation products has not been established with precision, and may be smaller than we estimate.\nOur estimate of the annual total addressable market for balloon sinus dilation products is based on a number of internal and third-party estimates, including, without limitation, the number of annual patient visits to ENT and primary care physicians, internal estimates regarding the number of certain types of FESS procedures performed annually, and our estimate of the number of people currently under medical management who would benefit from and be amenable to a balloon sinus procedure. In addition, our internal estimates are based in large part on current patterns of patient selection by ENT physicians for balloon sinus dilation. While we believe these factors have historically provided and may continue to provide us with effective tools in estimating the total market for balloon sinus dilation procedures and our products, these estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our products may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of patients who would benefit from our products and the annual total addressable market for our products is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to expand, manage, maintain and motivate our direct sales and marketing organizations we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue.\nWe began selling our first FDA-cleared product, FinESS, in April 2008. We subsequently began selling our XprESS in February 2010. As a result, we have limited experience marketing and selling our products. Our direct sales organization, including marketing and reimbursement has increased significantly over the past several years. Our operating results are directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our employees. If our direct sales force fails to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales may suffer.\nWe will need to retain and develop our direct sales personnel to build upon their expertise, tenure with our products and their relationships with customers. In order to generate future sales growth, we will need to expand the size and geographic scope of our direct sales organization. Accordingly, our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales personnel with significant technical knowledge of sinus procedures and related products. Because the competition for their services is high, we cannot assure you we will be able to hire and retain additional personnel on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to hire or retain qualified sales personnel would prevent us from expanding our business and generating sales. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, in January 2017, we appointed a new Vice President, Sales. While we expect this management change to enhance the effectiveness of our sales organization, no assurance can be provided that it will or that it will not have an adverse effect on our sales organization and our future revenues.\nWe may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nOur past growth has provided, and our future growth may create, challenges to our organization. The number of our employees has increased significantly during the past several years. In the future, we expect to hire and train new personnel as we continue to\ngrow and expand our operations. As a public company, we need to support managerial, operational, financial and other resources. This growth may place significant strain on us. Successful growth is also dependent upon our ability to implement appropriate financial and management controls and systems and procedures. If we fail to manage these challenges effectively, there may be an adverse impact on our business.\nOur international third-party distributors may not effectively distribute our products.\nWe depend in part on medical device distributors and strategic relationships for the marketing and selling of our products outside of the United States and the United Kingdom. We depend on these distributors\u2019 efforts to market our products, yet we are unable to control their efforts completely. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products, and in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract and retain key executives and highly qualified personnel.\nWe believe that our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our key executives and personnel, some of which have changed over the last year. For example, effective as of January 5, 2017, we have a new Vice President, Sales and a new General Counsel. Our Vice President, Reimbursement retired on December 31, 2016, and a new Vice President, Reimbursement is joining us on February 27, 2017. We also have a Chief Financial Officer who started with us in May 2016. As new and promoted employees gain experience in their roles, we could experience inefficiencies or lack of business continuity due to loss of historical knowledge and a lack of familiarity of new and promoted employees with business processes, operating requirements, policies and procedures. It is important to our success that these key executives quickly adapt to and excel in their new roles. If they are unable to do so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the loss of the services of any member of our senior management might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives by diverting management\u2019s attention to transition matters and identification of suitable replacements, if any, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain fixed term employment contracts with any of our employees. Each of our executives and key employees may terminate his or her employment with us at any time. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and therefore could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we do not carry any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances.\nMany of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of our common stock or a number of common stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave our company if the shares they own have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional executive officers and other key employees.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our reputation and business. We may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. This risk exists even if a device is cleared or approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products are designed to affect, and any future products will be designed to affect, important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our products or our products in development could result in patient injury or death. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits. We may be subject to product liability claims if our balloon sinus dilation or other products cause, or merely appear to have caused, patient injury or death. In addition, an injury that is caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and raw materials, may be the basis for a claim against us. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ncosts of litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our existing or new products;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products or, if cleared or approved, products in development;\n\u2022\ndamage to our business reputation;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or withdrawals from the market;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or\n\u2022\nloss of revenue.\nWhile we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our products may delay the supply of those products to our customers and may impact our reputation. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in initiating an appropriate market recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future or that these efforts will have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Such recalls and withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by physicians or patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our products, either of which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, although we have product liability and clinical study liability insurance that we believe is appropriate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. Our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we could be exposed to significant liabilities. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe utilize third-party, single-source suppliers for some components and materials used in our products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on single-source suppliers for some components and materials used in our products. Our ability to supply our products commercially and to develop any future products depends, in part, on our ability to obtain these components in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization and clinical testing. While our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products on a timely basis in the past, we cannot assure that they will in the future be able to meet our demand for their products, either because we do not have long-term agreements with those suppliers, our relative importance as a customer to those suppliers, or their ability to produce the components used in our products.\nWhile we believe replacement suppliers exist for all components and materials we obtain from single sources, establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of these components or materials, if required, may not be accomplished quickly. Even if we are able to find a replacement supplier, the replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval, which could result in further delay. While we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the single-source components and materials used in our products in the event of disruption, those inventories may not be sufficient.\nIf our third-party suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of materials on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality on a timely basis, the continued commercialization of our products, the supply of our products to customers and the development of any future products would be delayed, limited or prevented, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of ENT physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of ENT physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer with those ENT physicians or patients and our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe have limited prior experience selling our products outside of the United States and do not know if we will be successful in achieving adoption of our products and revenue growth outside of the United States in a timely manner. A variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe established a subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 2015 and have been selling our products in certain European and other countries using a combination of direct sales representatives and a network of independent distributors. We now market our products in over 10 countries outside the United States. Although our international sales comprised less than 10 percent of our revenues during 2016, they may increase and comprise a greater portion in future periods. Our international sales and operations potentially subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in finding effective distributors;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and increases in infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology;\n\u2022\ntraining of third parties on our products and the procedures in which they are used;\n\u2022\nreduced and difficult protection, enforcing or defending for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations; new or enhanced trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors; withdrawal from or revision to international trade agreements and the imposition or increases in import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, import and export quotas and other trade restrictions, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating performance based on our geographic mix of sales;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\ninternational regulators and third-party payors who may require additional clinical studies prior to approving or allowing reimbursement for our products;\n\u2022\ndisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, regulations of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Controls, or OFAC, and U.S. anti-money laundering regulations, as well as exposure of our foreign operations to liability under these regulatory regimes;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nnational and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes or terrorist acts;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nhigher tax rates and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating cash and/or earnings to the U.S.; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nFurthermore, in June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, negotiations are expected to determine the future terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on the movement of goods and\npeople between the United Kingdom and European Union countries and increased regulatory complexities, which could affect our ability to sell our products in certain European Union countries through our subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and Euro. In addition, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to continuing membership with the European Union. We do not know to what extent these changes will impact our business. These possible effects of Brexit, and others that we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nWe maintain policies, procedures and internal controls designed to promote compliance with the FCPA, OFAC restrictions and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws. We plan to regularly evaluate these policies and to enhance them as our international business develops and expands. If we, our business partners, distributors or intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, OFAC restrictions or similar laws of other countries, or our controls and procedures fail to detect such noncompliance, governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere, as applicable, could seek to impose civil penalties, criminal fines, and other collateral consequences.\nMost of our product sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars. However, with our subsidiary in the United Kingdom and increasing operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies have recently impacted and in the future could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, such fluctuations could decrease demand for our products. For example, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to the British Pound Sterling and Euro or other foreign currencies in which we transact business, our products could become more costly to the international customers and therefore less competitive in international markets. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws around the world where we conduct activities and sell our products. We face significant risks and liability if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party business partners, such as distributors or resellers, from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties or candidates, employees of public international organizations including healthcare professionals, or private-sector recipients for the corrupt purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage.\nWe leverage various third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We, our distributors and channel partners, and our other third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities (such as in the context of obtaining government approvals, registrations, or licenses) and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. As such, we intend to continue to implement an FCPA/anti-corruption compliance program to ensure compliance with such laws but cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action or related investigation may result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nIf we fail to comply with U.S. export control and economic sanctions or fail to expand and maintain an effective sales force or successfully develop our international distribution network, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe currently derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales generated from our own predominantly U.S. but to a lesser extent our U.K. direct sales force. Failure to maintain or expand our direct sales force could adversely impact our financial and operating performance. Additionally, we use international distributors in certain foreign countries to augment our sales efforts. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully develop our relationships with third-party distributors internationally. In\naddition, we are subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws relating to the sale of our products, the violation of which could result in substantial penalties being imposed against us. More broadly, if we fail to comply with export control laws or successfully develop our relationship with international distributors, our sales could fail to grow or could decline, and our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. Distributors that are in the business of selling other medical products may not devote a sufficient level of resources and support required to generate awareness of our products and grow or maintain product sales. If our distributors are unwilling or unable to market and sell our products, or if they do not perform to our expectations, we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance and sales of our products.\nFailure of a key information technology system, process or site could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business. These systems impact, among other things, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, data security and other processes necessary to manage our business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, in 2015, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system designed to integrate our operations, including supply-chain, order entry, manufacturing, inventory and financial reporting, among others. Our experience with this system is still limited. If the system does not continue to perform in the manner expected, our business, including our ability to report financial results accurately and timely, could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a security breach occurs, and our proprietary information, or the information of patients using our products, is disclosed or misused, then we could be affected by the imposition of regulatory sanctions or fines, the incurring of expenses resulting from a data privacy breach, an increase in operating expenses, or the occurrence of other adverse consequences to our business.\nIn addition, we accept payments for many of our sales through credit and debit card transactions, which are handled through a third-party payment processor. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks related to credit and debit card payments. As a result of these transactions, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and could require us to either increase the prices we charge for our products or experience an increase in our costs and expenses. In addition, as part of the payment processing process, we transmit our customers\u2019 credit and debit card information to our third-party payment processor. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our customers\u2019 credit or debit card information if the security of our third-party credit card payment processor is breached. We and our third-party credit card payment processor are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we or our third-party credit card payment processor fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, and there may be an adverse impact on our business.\nIf our facilities are damaged or become inoperable, we will be unable to continue to research, develop and manufacture our products and, as a result, there will be an adverse impact on our business until we are able to secure a new facility.\nWe do not have redundant facilities. We perform substantially all of our research and development, manufacturing and back office activity and maintain substantially all our raw material and finished goods inventory in a single location in Plymouth, Minnesota, although XeroGel nasal packing material continues to be manufactured in Hayward, California. Our facilities and equipment would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, flooding, fire and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for some period of time. The inability to perform those activities, combined with our limited inventory of reserve raw materials and finished product, may result in the inability to continue manufacturing our products during such periods and the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur total assets include substantial amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations.\nGoodwill and intangible assets represented approximately 14% of our total assets as of December 31, 2016. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. We evaluate intangible assets for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results. Such estimates and assumptions may not prove to be accurate in the future. After performing our evaluation for impairment, including an analysis to determine the recoverability of intangible assets, we\nwill record a noncash impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If these impairment losses are significant, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation\nWe received a Form 483 from the FDA. This could lead to a warning letter, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn September 2016, following an inspection of certain documentation relating to our prospective, multi-center study of children with chronic rhinosinusitis treated with the XprESS\u2122 Multi-Sinus Dilation System, the FDA issued a Form 483, List of Inspectional Observations, containing two observations. The first observation relates to not obtaining FDA and IRB approval for changes to an investigational plan and the second observation relates to not ensuring prompt compliance with the study protocol by clinical investigators. These observations relate to study deviations which occurred when some physicians decided to treat sinuses outside of the scope of the study protocol due to medical necessity thereby avoiding the need for a follow-on procedure. Following our receipt of the Form 483, we implemented and completed corrective and preventive actions to fully address the FDA observations, and we provided written responses to the FDA detailing these corrective and preventive actions completed. The outcome of this matter is presently uncertain. We cannot assure that the FDA will conclude that our corrective and preventive actions are adequate to address the observations. If the FDA is not satisfied, it may issue a warning letter to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA regulatory clearance process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and the failure to obtain and maintain required regulatory clearances and approvals could prevent us from commercializing our products.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated product or a new use of or a claim for a cleared product in the United States, we must obtain clearance from the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process, unless an exemption applies. In addition, we may be required to seek FDA clearance for any changes or modifications to our products that could significantly affect their safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a change in intended use. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but the FDA may review the manufacturer\u2019s decisions not to seek a new 510(k). We may make changes to our 510(k)-cleared products without seeking additional clearances or approvals if we believe such clearances or approvals are not necessary. However, the FDA may disagree with this determination and require that we obtain new clearances or approvals for modifications, in which case we may be required to recall and stop marketing our products as modified, which could require us to redesign our products, conduct clinical trials to support any modifications, and pay significant regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, the FDA may not approve or clear our products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization or could require clinical trials to support any modifications.\nThe 510(k) clearance processes can be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. In addition to the time required to conduct clinical trials, if necessary, it generally takes from three to six months from submission of an application to obtain 510(k) clearance; however, it may take longer and 510(k) clearance may never be obtained. Our ability to obtain additional regulatory clearances for new products and indications may be significantly delayed or may never be obtained. Moreover, any new product introduction or product modification could be subjected to the lengthier, more rigorous FDA premarketing process.\nDelays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, regulatory clearances for any product enhancements or new products we develop would result in delayed or no realization of revenue from such product enhancements or new products and in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability.\nFurther, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. For example, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the program, and in January 2011, announced several proposed actions intended to reform the review process governing the clearance of medical devices. The FDA intends these reform actions to improve the efficiency and transparency of the clearance process, as well as bolster patient safety. In addition, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \u201cMedical Device Regulatory Improvements\u201d and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-clearance or approval.\nIn addition, we are required to continue to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once we have obtained clearance for a product. We cannot assure you that we will successfully maintain the clearances we have received or may receive in the future. In addition, our existing clearances can be revoked if any issues arise that bring into question our products\u2019 safety or effectiveness. Any failure to maintain compliance with FDA regulatory requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nThe products we currently market have been cleared by the FDA for specific indications. We train our marketing and direct sales force to not promote our products for uses outside of the FDA-cleared indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our products off-label, when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those cleared by the FDA or approved by any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nIf the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment of our operations.\nIn addition, physicians may misuse our products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Similarly, in an effort to decrease costs, physicians may also reuse those of our products that are intended for a single use or may purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us, which could result in product failure and liability. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the FDA, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nOur marketed products are subject to Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, obligations, which require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which our products malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, it could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report under the MDR regulations is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearances, seizure of our products, or delay in clearance of future products.\nWe and any of our contract manufacturers are subject to various governmental regulations related to the manufacturing of our products, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with, experience delays in our product commercialization as a result of, and be subject to material sanctions if we or our contract manufacturers violate, these regulations.\nThe methods used in, and the facilities used for, the manufacture of our products must comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of medical devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities, and both we and any contract manufacturers are subject to such inspections. We cannot guarantee that we or any third-party manufacturers will take the necessary steps to comply with applicable regulations, which could cause delays in the delivery of our products.\nFailure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 manufacturing processes, including any failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection, can result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nadministrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production or distribution;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending or future clearances or approvals for our products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal or suspension of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nclinical holds;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution of us or our employees.\nAny of these actions could prevent us from marketing, distributing or selling our products and would likely harm our business.\nOutside of the United States, our devices must comply with the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which they are marketed, and compliance may be costly and time-consuming. Failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States will prevent us from marketing our products in such jurisdictions.\nWe currently market, and intends to continue to market, our products in Europe. To market our products in the Member States of the European Economic Area, the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directives (Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices, as amended). Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. In order to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directives, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA, to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a certification demonstrating compliance with the essential requirements. Based on this certification, we can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity, which allows us to affix the CE mark to our products.\nIn September 2012, the European Commission published proposals for the revision of the E.U. regulatory framework for medical devices. The proposal would replace the Medical Devices Directive with a new regulation (the \u201cMedical Devices Regulation\u201d). In April 2014, the European Parliament approved a package of reforms to the European Commission's proposals. In September 2015, the European Council published responses to the European Parliament\u2019s proposed reforms. In June 2016 European lawmakers published a draft version of the Medical Devices Regulation, consolidating the various proposed regulations into a single document. Unlike the Directives that must be implemented into national laws, the Medical Devices Regulation would be directly applicable in all EEA Member States and so is intended to eliminate current national differences in regulation of medical devices. Under the draft version of the Medical Devices Regulation, only designated \u201cspecial notified bodies\u201d would be entitled to conduct conformity assessments of high-risk devices. These special notified bodies will need to notify the European Commission when they receive an application for a conformity assessment for a new high-risk device. The European Commission will then forward the notification and the accompanying documents on the device to the Medical Devices Coordination Group, a new, yet to be created body chaired by the European Commission and consisting of representatives of Member States, for an opinion.\nIf adopted, the Medical Devices Regulation is expected to apply three years after its formal adoption, which is anticipated to occur in 2017. In its current draft form, the Medical Devices Regulation would, among other things, also impose additional reporting requirements on manufacturers of high risk medical devices, impose an obligation on manufacturers to appoint a \u201cqualified person\u201d responsible for regulatory compliance, and provide for stricter clinical evidence requirements. However, these new rules and procedures may result in increased regulatory oversight of any future high-risk devices that Entellus may develop and this may, in turn, increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to maintain or place such devices on the EEA market. We do not know when or if the Medical Devices Regulation will be adopted or what exact requirements will be imposed on us if adopted. However, additional or more stringent approval requirements imposed by the Medical Devices Regulation could cause us to fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in the EEA which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals or certifications outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Clearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities or Notified Bodies in other countries, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority or Notified Body does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. We may be required to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical studies even if the FDA clearance or approval, or the right to bear the CE mark, has been obtained. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls. A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in their design or manufacture. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation and business, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nDepending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action.\nIf clinical studies of our future products do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the United States or, with respect to our current or future products, elsewhere, we will be unable to expand the indications for or commercialize these products.\nWe are currently conducting a Eustachian tube study to support a 510(k) clearance for a new indication for our balloon sinus dilation products. In addition, we will likely need to conduct additional clinical studies in the future to support clearance for new indications for our existing products or new product lines, or for the approval of the use of our products in some foreign countries. Clinical testing can take many years, can be expensive and carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of testing. Our clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance or approval and, ultimately, the commercialization of that device or indication for use. Even if our future products are cleared in the United States, commercialization of our products in foreign countries would require approval by regulatory authorities in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our business.\nHealthcare regulatory reform may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the regulatory and healthcare systems in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States in recent years, new legislation has been proposed and adopted at the federal and state levels that is effecting major changes in the healthcare system. In addition, new regulations and interpretations of existing healthcare statutes and regulations are frequently adopted and cannot be predicted.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. One of the goals of the healthcare reform of the Affordable Care Act was to expand coverage to more individuals. However the Affordable Care Act and other reform legislation increase government price controls, impose additional regulatory mandates and involve other measures designed to constrain medical costs. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services and significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act:\n\u2022\nimposes an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, although the effective rate paid may be lower. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, the excise tax has been suspended from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2018;\n\u2022\nestablishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;\n\u2022\nimplements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u2022\ncreates an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to Congress to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nThe results of the 2016 United States presidential and congressional elections may create regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to the United States government\u2019s role, in the United States healthcare industry. As a result of such elections, there are renewed and reinvigorated calls for the repeal and replacement of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. Any such repeal, replacement or material modification of the Affordable Care Act could cause significant uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare market, could increase our costs, decrease our revenues or inhibit our ability to sell our products. We cannot predict with certainty what impact any United States federal and state health reforms will have on us, but such changes could impose new and/or more stringent regulatory requirements on our activities or result in reduced reimbursement for our products, any of which could adversely impact our business and/or revenues.\nIn addition, third-party payors regularly update payments to physicians and hospitals where our products are used. For Medicare, annual updates to physician payments are made using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. However, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula, and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a merit based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians beginning in 2019. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the merit based incentive program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These and other payment updates could directly impact the demand for our products or any products we may develop in the future, if cleared or approved.\nFurthermore, we believe that many individuals who have obtained insurance coverage through the health insurance exchanges which arose as a result of the Affordable Care Act have done so with policies that have significantly higher deductibles than policies they may have obtained prior to its enactment. Because the out-of-pocket costs of undergoing a procedure such as balloon sinus dilation for patients who have not met their deductible for a given year would be significantly higher than they historically would have been, these patients may be discouraged from undergoing such a procedure due to the cost. Any reluctance on the part of patients to undergo procedures utilizing our products due to cost could impact our ability to expand sales of our products and could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to additional federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to our healthcare business; our failure to comply with those laws could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors for our products, because our products are or may be covered by insurance plans, including, without limitation, federal and state funded health care programs, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal and state governments, which could adversely impact our business. U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which applies to our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nfederal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, on certain device manufacturers of devices for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u2022\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them are highly technical in nature and have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effect such legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including, without limitation, certain sales and marketing practices and financial arrangements, including the provision of stock options as partial compensation for consulting services, with physicians, some of whom use or purchase our products, and other customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any investigation of us or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal\nexpenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely impact our business.\nWe may be subject to, or become subject to, in the future, foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Ensuring compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.\nIn the conduct of our business, we may at times process personal data. The U.S. federal government and various states have adopted or proposed guidelines or rules for the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. The European Union also has laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal data obtained from their residents, which are often more restrictive than those in the United States and which restrict transfers of data to the United States unless certain requirements are met. We have operations in the United Kingdom that may subject to these rules. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. In addition, these rules are constantly changing. For example, following a decision of the European Court of Justice in October 2015, transferring personal data to U.S. companies that had certified as member of the U.S. Safe Harbor Scheme was declared invalid and the other methods to permit transfer are now under review.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by European Data Protection Authorities, fines and penalties, litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers, healthcare professional and their patients to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligation under privacy laws and regulation and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe laws in the European Union are under reform and from 2018 onwards, we will be subject to the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation because we are processing data in the European Union and/or offering goods to residents of the European Union. The General Data Protection Regulation is expected to come into force in early 2018. It increases the deadline for data breach notifications, imposes additional obligations when we contract with service providers and increases administrative burdens on companies processing personal data. If we do not comply with our obligations under the Regulation they could be exposed to significant fines of up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory registrations or approvals for our current or future products and indications, which could adversely impact our business.\nSales of our devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the United States. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain registration or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. In certain countries we intend to rely upon third-party distributors to obtain all required regulatory registrations and approvals, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such registrations or approvals. Our distributors in these countries may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or registrations, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If these distributors experience delays in receiving necessary registrations or approvals to market our products outside the United States, or if they fail to receive those registrations or approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in certain international markets effectively, or at all.\nOur operations involve the use of hazardous and toxic materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive, and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur operations use or generate small volumes of hazardous or toxic materials. We are therefore subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault, and environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with\nenvironmental, health and safety laws, there can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third-party property damage and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production or a cessation of operations. We also expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental and health and safety laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs, and may require us to change how we manufacture our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Relating to Capital Requirements and Finances\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay or reduce our commercialization efforts or product development programs.\nWe believe that the net proceeds from our IPO, together with the net proceeds from our underwritten public offering of common stock in the first quarter of 2017, our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated revenue will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least 24 months. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Any future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance and sale of our products;\n\u2022\nthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of additional regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with any product recall that may occur;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in products, technologies and businesses; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of operating as a public company.\nIn March 2016, we filed, and the SEC declared effective, an unallocated, or \u201cuniversal,\u201d shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which permits us to offer and sell, from time to time, on a continuous or delayed basis in the future, up to $100 million of equity, debt or other types of securities described in the registration statement, or any combination of such securities, in one or more future public offerings, and permits certain selling stockholders to sell up to 3 million shares of our common stock from time to time in one or more offerings. We used this shelf registration statement to sell approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2017 public offering, in addition to approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock sold by certain selling stockholders in the offering. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third-parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFurthermore, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third-parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our operating results.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility which beginning in March 2017, we are required to make monthly one payment of principal and interest in the amount of $1.8 million and 21 equal month payment of principal and interest in the amount of $1.0 million each. If we do not pay off or refinance this debt, these payments may adversely affect our operating results\nand cash flows. In addition, the terms of our credit agreement may restrict our current and future operations, and could affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations.\nWe have a credit facility with Oxford Finance LLC. As of December 31, 2016, we had $20.0 million of debt outstanding and no unused credit under the credit facility. In February 2017, we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated loan and security agreement to allow principal payments due on February 1, 2017 and March 1, 2017 to be instead paid on March 15, 2017. Accordingly, on March 15, 2017, we will make one principal and interest payment of $1.8 million and beginning on April 1, 2017 make 21 equal monthly payment of principal and interest in the amount of approximately $1.0 million each. In addition to the principal and interest payments under the credit facility, we are required to pay a final payment fee of 7.15% on all amounts outstanding, which is being accrued over the credit facility term and will be due at the earlier of maturity or prepayment. If we repay the amounts borrowed under the credit facility prior to maturity, we will also be required to pay a prepayment fee equal to 0.75% with respect to the principal amount that is prepaid. We have agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber our intellectual property assets, except for permitted liens, as such terms are defined in the credit facility and except as otherwise provided for in the credit facility. The credit facility contains no financial covenants, and we were in compliance with its affirmative and restrictive covenants as of December 31, 2016. If we do not pay off or refinance this debt, these payments may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. In addition, the credit agreement contains events of default customary for transactions of this type, including non-payment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, and bankruptcy. In the event we fail to satisfy our covenants, or otherwise go into default, Oxford Finance LLC, has a number of remedies, including sale of our assets and acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, and its research and development credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which might be beyond our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. For these reasons, in the event we experience a change of control, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards, even if we attain profitability.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property Matters\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection and third-parties from which we license intellectual property may not enforce their intellectual property rights, which may permit third-parties to compete against us more effectively.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies and inventions used in, or embodied by, our products. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions in our consulting and employment agreements. These legal means afford only limited protection, however, and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Furthermore, while we have no reason to believe that any third parties hold rights of ownership to the intellectual property we regard as our own, we cannot assure shareholders that third parties of which we are unaware do not possess such rights, or that we will not be subject to, and forced to defend against, third-party claims of ownership to our intellectual property in the future. In either case, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\nPatents\nThe process of applying for patent protection itself is time-consuming and expensive and we cannot assure you that all of our patent applications will issue as patents or that, if issued, they will issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. The rights granted to us under our patents, including prospective rights sought in our pending patent applications, may not be meaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage, and they could be opposed, contested, or circumvented by our competitors or declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed by third-parties. For example, we do not control the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the Acclarent License described above. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted or enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be\nreduced or eliminated. In addition, because the Acclarent License is non-exclusive, Acclarent could choose to also license the same intellectual property to other third-party competitors, which would also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications relating to our technology and products. The rights granted to us under these patents, including prospective rights sought in our pending patent applications, could be opposed, contested or circumvented by our competitors or declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings. If any of our patents are challenged, invalidated or legally circumvented by third-parties, and if we do not own other enforceable patents protecting our products, competitors could market products and use processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours, and our business will suffer. In addition, the patents we own may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage, and competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes comparable to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation, and switch the U.S. patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement, and defense of our patents and applications. We may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third-parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nMoreover, the USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products or procedures, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, we do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist in the future, and the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our products.\nTrademarks\nWe rely on our trademarks as one means to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. Our trademark applications may not be approved, however. Third-parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nTrade Secrets and Know-How\nWe may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective.\nMoreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected so as to protect our market against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nWe may in the future be a party to patent and other intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to successfully market our products.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by frequent and extensive intellectual property litigation and is highly competitive. Our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our products and/or the methods employed in our products are covered by their patents. If our products or methods are found to infringe, we could be prevented from manufacturing or marketing our products. In the event that we become involved in such a dispute, we may incur significant costs and expenses and may need to devote resources to resolving any claims, which would reduce the cash we have available for operations and may be distracting to management. We do not know whether our competitors or potential competitors have applied for, will apply for, or will obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, import or export our products. Competing products may also be sold in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, alleging our infringement of a competitor\u2019s patents, we could be prevented from marketing our products in one or more foreign countries. We may also initiate litigation against third-parties to protect our own intellectual property. Our intellectual property has not been tested in litigation. If we initiate litigation to protect our rights, we run the risk of having our patents invalidated, which would undermine our competitive position.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time-consuming, and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, and could prohibit us from using technologies essential to our products, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. If relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be prevented from selling our products unless we can obtain licenses to use technology or ideas covered by such patents. We do not know whether any necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we cannot obtain these licenses, we could be forced to design around those patents at additional cost or abandon the product altogether. As a result, our ability to grow our business and compete in the market may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. In addition, we may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our products could have an adverse impact on our business, and may prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nOur stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. During 2016, the sale price of our common stock ranged from $13.72 to $22.63. Our daily trading volume ranged from 9,200 to 309,500 during 2016. In recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe volume and timing of sales of our products;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or others in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of others in our industry;\n\u2022\nmedia exposure of our products or of those of others in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in reimbursement;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments with respect to our or others\u2019 intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims or other litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nIn addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. If any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take, and intend to take, advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d In particular, while we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (1) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) we will be exempt from any rules that could be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on financial statements, (3) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (4) we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, while we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we will not be required to comply with any new financial accounting standard until such standard is generally applicable to private companies. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or elect not to avail themselves of this provision.\nWe may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as December 31, 2020, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, though we may cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d earlier under certain circumstances, including if (1) we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (2) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 or (3) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile.\nOur directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of February 15, 2017, our officers, directors and principal stockholders each holding more than 5% of our common stock, collectively control approximately 45% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they were to act together, would be able to control the management and affairs of our company and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nFuture sales of shares could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur stock price could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Persons who were our stockholders prior to our IPO continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock, and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nMoreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights to require us to register their shares under the Securities Act, and to participate in future registrations of securities by us, subject to certain conditions. In addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options, issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units or reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act and, in any event, we have filed a registration statement permitting shares of common stock issuable under our stock incentive plans to be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nCertain of our employees, executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee, director or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from the employee, officer or director. A Rule 10b5-1 plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our employees, executive officers and directors also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material, nonpublic information. Shares of our common stock sold under these plans, or the perception that such shares may be sold in the public market, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, sales by our insiders under these plans may adversely affect investors\u2019 views of the future value of our common stock.\nIn the event that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As a public company, we are required, under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.\nWe believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur in the future and not be detected.\nIn addition, once we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the federal securities laws, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While we may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as December 31, 2020, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, we may cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d earlier under certain circumstances and that could accelerate our timeline for complying with Section 404(b).\nIf we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors, when required, are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, or be delayed in producing these financial reports, both of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We could also be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Market and could be subject to securities litigation.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include that:\n\u2022\nour board of directors has the exclusive right to expand the size of our board of directors and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered three-year terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nour stockholders may not act by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nour board of directors may alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u2022\nstockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and\n\u2022\nour board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders. We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums\nand protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, our current credit facility precludes, and any future debt agreements may preclude, us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 15176, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ENTL"}
