{"cik": "1066923", "company": "SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the following risk factors, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed herein, and in other documents that the Company subsequently files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the \u201cCommission\u201d or the \u201cSEC\u201d), that update, supplement or supersede such information for which documents are incorporated by reference into this Report. Additional risks not presently known to the Company, or which the Company considers immaterial based on information currently available, may also materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described herein occur, the Company\u2019s business, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, which could result in a decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, causing you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur revenue increased significantly from 2006 to 2010 with revenue of approximately $17.4 million in 2006, approximately $29.4 million in 2007, approximately $41.7 million in 2008, approximately $59.2 million in 2009, approximately $93.2 million in 2010. In 2011, our revenue decreased by 9.9% to $84.0 million as compared to the prior year. In 2012, our revenue increased by 22% to $102 million. In 2013, our revenue decreased 23% to $79.0 million. In 2014, our revenue increased to $99 million. In 2015, our revenue decreased to $81 million. In 2016, our revenue decreased to $34 million. If our business and markets experience significant growth, we will need to expand our business to maintain our competitive position. We may face challenges in managing and financing expansion of our business, facilities and product offerings, including challenges relating to integration of acquired businesses and increased demands on our management team, employees and facilities. Failure to effectively deal with increased demands on us could interrupt or adversely affect our operations and cause production backlogs, longer product development time frames and administrative inefficiencies. Other challenges involved with expansion, acquisitions and operation include:\n\u25cf unanticipated costs;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf obtaining sufficient working capital to support expansion;\n\u25cf expanding our product offerings and maintaining the high quality of our products;\n\u25cf continuing to fill customers\u2019 orders on time;\n\u25cf maintaining adequate control of our expenses and accounting systems;\n\u25cf successfully integrating any future acquisitions; and\n\u25cf anticipating and adapting to changing conditions in the fruit juice and beverage industry, whether from changes in government regulations, mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors, technological developments or other economic, competitive or market dynamics.\nEven if we obtain benefits of expansion in the form of increased sales, there may be delay between the time when the expenses associated with an expansion or acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits, which could negatively affect our earnings.\nOur revenue and profitability are heavily dependent on prevailing prices for our products and raw materials, and if we are unable to effectively offset cost increases by adjusting the pricing of our products, our margins and operating income may decrease.\nAs a producer of commodities, our revenue, gross margins and cash flows from operations are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices we receive for our products and the cost of our raw materials, neither of which we control. The factors influencing the sales price of concentrated fruit juice include the supply price of fresh fruit, supply and demand of our products in international and domestic markets and competition in the fruit juice industry.\nThe price of our principal raw materials, fresh fruit, is subject to market volatility as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, governmental regulations, weather, transportation delays and other uncertainties that are beyond our control. Due to such market volatility, we generally do not, nor do we expect to, have long-term contracts with our fresh fruit suppliers. Other significant raw materials used in our business include packing barrels, pectic enzyme, amylase and auxiliary materials such as coal, electricity and water. Prices for these items may be volatile as well and we may experience shortages in these items from time to time. As a result, we cannot guarantee that the necessary raw materials to produce our products will continue to be available to us at prices currently in effect or acceptable to us. In the event raw material prices increase materially, we may not be able to adjust our product prices, especially in the short term, to recover such cost increases. If we are not able to effectively offset these cost increases by adjusting the price of our products, our margins will decrease and earnings will suffer accordingly.\nWeather and other environmental factors affect our raw material supply and a reduction in the quality or quantity of our fresh fruit supplies may have material adverse consequences on our financial results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by weather and environmental factors beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions during the growing or squeezing seasons. A significant reduction in the quantity or quality of fresh fruit harvested resulting from adverse weather conditions, disease or other factors could result in increased per unit processing costs and decreased production, with adverse financial consequences to us.\nWe sell our products primarily through distributors and delays in delivery or poor handling by distributors may affect our sales and damage our reputation.\nWe primarily sell our products through our distributors and rely on these distributors for the distribution of our products. These distributors are not obligated to continue to sell our products. Any disruptions in our relationships with our distributors could cause interruption to the supply of our products to retailers, which would harm our revenue and results of operations. In addition, delivery disruptions may occur for various reasons beyond our control, including poor handling by distributors or third party transport operators, transportation bottlenecks, natural disasters and labor strikes, and could lead to delayed or lost deliveries. Some of our products are perishable and poor handling by distributors and third party transport operators could also result in damage to our products that would make them unfit for sale. If our products are not delivered to retailers on time, or are delivered damaged, we may have to pay compensation, we could lose business and our reputation could be harmed.\nBecause we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate and our annual performance will depend largely on results from our first and fourth quarters.\nOur business is highly seasonal, reflecting the harvest season of our primary source fruits from July or August of a year to April the following year. Typically, a substantial portion of our revenue is earned during our first and fourth quarters. We generally experience lower revenue during our second and third quarters. Generally, sales in the first and fourth quarters accounted for approximately 65% to 72% of our revenue of the whole year. If sales in our first and fourth quarters are lower than expected, our operating results would be adversely affected and it would have a disproportionately large impact on our annual operating results.\nIf we are unable to gain market acceptance or significant market share for the new products we introduce, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nOur future business and financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to successfully respond to consumer preferences by introducing new products and improving existing products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to gain market acceptance or significant market share for our new products. Consumer preferences change, and any new products that we introduce may fail to meet the particular tastes or requirements of consumers, or may be unable to replace their existing preferences. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these particular tastes or changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause us to be unable to recover our development, production and marketing costs, thereby leading to a decline in our profitability.\nThe development and introduction of new products is key to our expansion strategy. We incur significant development and marketing costs in connection with the introduction of new products. Successfully launching and selling new products puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources, and we may fail to invest sufficient funds in order to market and sell a new product effectively. If we are not successful in marketing and selling new products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on consumer spending on our products.\nThe worldwide economy has not yet fully recovered from a recession, which has reduced discretionary income of consumers. The adverse effect of a sustained international economic downturn, including sustained periods of decreased consumer spending, high unemployment levels, declining consumer or business confidence and continued volatility and disruption in the credit and capital markets, will likely result in reduced demand for our products as consumers turn to less expensive substitute goods or forego certain purchases altogether. To the extent the international economic downturn continues or worsens, we could experience a reduction in sales volume. If we are unable to reduce our operating costs and expenses proportionately, many of which are fixed, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nConcerns over food safety and public health may affect our operations by increasing our costs and negatively impacting demand for our products.\nWe could be adversely affected by diminishing confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients. As a result, we may elect or be required to incur additional costs aimed at increasing consumer confidence in the safety of our products. For example, a crisis in the PRC over melamine contaminated milk in 2008 has adversely impacted Chinese food exports since October 2008, as reported by the Chinese General Administration of Customs, although most foods exported from the PRC were not significantly affected by the melamine contamination. In addition, our concentrated fruit juices exported to foreign countries must comply with quality standards in those countries. Our success depends on our ability to maintain the quality of our existing and new products. Product quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products.\nWe face increasing competition from both domestic and foreign companies, and any failure by us to compete effectively could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe juice beverage industry is highly competitive, and we expect it to continue to become even more competitive. Our ability to compete in the industry depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to distinguish our products from those of our competitors by providing high quality products at reasonable prices that appeal to consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences. There are currently a number of well-established companies producing products that compete directly with ours. Some of our competitors may have been in business longer than we have, may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may be better established in their markets. We anticipate that our competitors will continue to improve their products and introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics.\nWe cannot guarantee that our current or potential competitors will not provide products comparable or superior to those we provide or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements. It is also possible that there will be significant consolidation in the juice beverage industry among our competitors, and alliances may develop among competitors. These alliances may rapidly acquire significant market share, and some of our distributors may commence production of products similar to those we sell to them. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our profit margins. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Aggressive marketing or pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions involving significant expenditures of cash, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of stock, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings, augment our market coverage, enhance our technological capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. From time to time, we review investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in, and to acquire, businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of any future acquisitions, we may expend significant cash, incur substantial debt and/or issue equity securities and dilute the percentage ownership of current shareholders, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and the price of our Common Stock. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe require various licenses and permits to operate our business, and the loss of or failure to renew any or all of these licenses and permits could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn accordance with PRC laws and regulations, we have been required to maintain various licenses and permits in order to operate our business at the relevant manufacturing facilities including, without limitation, industrial product production permits. We are required to comply with applicable hygiene and food safety standards in relation to our production processes. Our premises and transportation vehicles are subject to regular inspections by the regulatory authorities for compliance with the Detailed Rules for Administration and Supervision of Quality and Safety in Food Producing and Processing Enterprises. Failure to pass these inspections, or the loss of or failure to renew our licenses and permits, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production activities, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nGovernmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenue.\nThe United States and various other governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the export of some of our products. Governmental regulation of exports, or our failure to obtain required export approval for our products, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue and profits. In addition, failure to comply with such regulations could result in penalties, costs and restrictions on export privileges. Additionally, the new U.S. presidential administration has indicated that it may seek changes to or withdraw the United States from various international treaties and trade arrangements. Uncertainty regarding policies affecting global trade may make it difficult for our management to accurately forecast our business, and increases in the duties, tariffs and other charges imposed on our products by the United States or other countries in which on our products are sold, or other restraints on international trade, could negatively affect our business and the results of our operations.\nWe do not presently maintain product liability insurance, and our property and equipment insurance does not cover the full value of our property and equipment, which leaves us with exposure in the event of loss or damage to our properties or claims filed against us.\nWe currently do not carry any product liability or other similar insurance. Product liability claims and lawsuits in the PRC generally are still rare, unlike in some other countries. Product liability exposures and litigation, however, could become more commonplace in the PRC. Moreover, we have product liability exposure in countries in which we sell our products, such as the United States, where product liability claims are more prevalent. As we expand our international sales, our liability exposure will increase.\nWe may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific copackers, markets or batches. Although historically we have not had any recall of our products, we cannot guarantee that circumstances or incidents will not occur that will require us to recall our products. We do not maintain recall insurance. In the event we experience product liability claims or a product recall, our business operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business and operations may be subject to disruption from work stoppages, terrorism or natural disasters.\nOur operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. If a major incident were to occur in either of the regions where our facilities or main offices are located, our facilities or offices or those of critical suppliers could be damaged or destroyed. Such a disruption could result in a reduction in available raw materials, the temporary or permanent loss of critical data, suspension of operations, delays in shipment of products and disruption of business generally, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur success depends substantially on the continued retention of certain key personnel and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future to support our growth.\nIf one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. While we depend on the abilities and participation of our current management team generally, we rely particularly upon Mr. Hongke Xue, our chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d); Mr. Yongke Xue, a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d); and Mr. Hanjun Zheng, our interim chief financial officer (\u201cCFO\u201d). The loss of the services of Messrs. Hongke Xue, Yongke Xue or Hanjun Zheng for any reason could significantly adversely impact our business and results of operations. Competition for senior management and senior technology personnel in the PRC is intense and the pool of qualified candidates is very limited. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the services of our senior executives and other key personnel will continue to be available to us, or that we will be able to find a suitable replacement for them if they were to leave.\nThe relative lack of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur management team lacks public company experience, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d). Our senior management does not have experience managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may be unable to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner or that adequately respond to the increased legal, regulatory and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly traded company. Our failure to comply with all applicable requirements could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, distract our management from attending to the management and growth of our business, result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal controls may be determined not to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, decrease the value of our Common Stock.\nThe PRC has not adopted management and financial reporting concepts and practices similar to those in the United States. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified finance and management employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing and maintaining accounting and financial controls, collecting financial data, budgeting, managing our funds and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet investors\u2019 expectations in the United States.\nRules adopted by the SEC, or the Commission, pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 require annual assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. This requirement first applied to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal controls over financial reporting as effective are relatively new and complex, and they require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could harm our business and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nWe may have inadvertently violated Sarbanes-Oxley Section 402 and Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act and may be subject to sanctions for such violations.\nSection 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) provides that it is unlawful for a company such as ours, which has a class of securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act to, directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary, extend or maintain credit in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer of the company. Issuers violating Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act may be subject to civil sanctions, including injunctive remedies and monetary penalties, as well as criminal sanctions. The imposition of any of such sanctions on the Company may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn February 2008, we purchased Pacific, which is the holding company for our operating subsidiary, SkyPeople (China). At the time, Hede, a PRC company owned by Yongke Xue, a member of the Board and our former chief executive officer, and Xiaoqin Yan, a former director on the Board, was indebted to SkyPeople (China) on account of previous loans and advances made by SkyPeople (China) to Hede. Such loans and advances totaled RMB 31,544,043 in the aggregate (or $4,318,281 based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2007) and were made during the period from June 6, 2007 to December 29, 2007 that were used by Hede to pay a portion of the purchase price for Hede\u2019s acquisition of Huludao Wonder Fruit Co., Ltd., or Huludao Wonder. In May 2008, SkyPeople (China) also assumed Hede\u2019s obligation of RMB 18,000,000 (or $2,638,329 based on the exchange rate December 31, 2008) for the balance of the purchase price for Huludao Wonder.\nOn June 10, 2008, Hede sold Huludao Wonder to SkyPeople (China) for a total price of RMB 48,250,000 (or $6,308,591 based on the exchange rate on June 1, 2007) the same price that Hede paid for Huludao Wonder. As of May 31, 2008, SkyPeople (China) had a related party receivable of RMB 48,929,272 (or $7,171,751 based on the exchange rate December 31, 2008) from Hede, which was credited against the purchase price, so that SkyPeople (China) did not pay any cash to Hede for the purchase, and the remaining balance of the loans and advances of RMB 679,272 (or $99,564 based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2008) to Hede was repaid to us on June 11, 2008. Hede paid no interest or other consideration to us on account of the time value of money with respect to the loans and advances made by SkyPeople (China) to Hede.\nNotwithstanding Hede\u2019s repayment in full of loans made by SkyPeople (China) to Hede, the existence of indebtedness of Hede to SkyPeople (China) at the time we acquired Pacific and the continuation of such indebtedness thereafter until it was fully repaid in June 2008 may constitute a violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act and Section 402(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nIn addition, in May 2008, Pacific erroneously paid $4,916,617 to its former shareholders, including Xiaoqing Yan and Yongke Xue, as the result of a dividend declared by Pacific in February 2008 prior to our acquisition of Pacific. Because the recipients of these funds were no longer shareholders of Pacific, the transaction was treated for accounting purposes as an interest free loan. In June 2008, the directors and other related parties returned the funds they received, without interest. Although the erroneously paid funds associated with Pacific\u2019s dividend declaration have been repaid to us in full, Xiaoqing Yan and Yongke Xue\u2019s receipt of the erroneous dividend may also be deemed to be a violation of the Exchange Act and Section 13(k) and Section 402(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions-Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons.\u201d\nPartially in response to the matters set forth above, in September 2008, the Board adopted a policy regarding approval of related party transactions. Under the policy, the Board\u2019s audit committee must approve any related party transaction involving an aggregate amount that is expected to exceed $50,000, and no director may participate in any discussion or approval of a transaction that would be considered to be a related party transaction in which such person is interested. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions-Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons.\u201d\nWe may need additional capital to fund our future operations and, if it is not available when needed, we may need to reduce our planned development and marketing efforts, which may reduce our sales revenue.\nWe believe that our existing working capital and cash available from operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if cash from future operations is insufficient, or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses, we may need additional capital. The development and marketing of new products and the expansion of distribution channels and associated support personnel require a significant commitment of resources. In addition, if the markets for our products develop more slowly than anticipated, or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenues, we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital. As a result, we could be required to raise additional capital. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, such securities may provide the holders certain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of common stockholders, and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. We cannot guarantee that additional capital, if required, will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our patents, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies. We hold two patents in the PRC covering our fruit processing technology. The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive and we cannot guarantee that our existing or future issued patents will be sufficient to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantages. We also cannot guarantee that our current or potential competitors do not have, and will not obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make or sell our products in the PRC or other countries.\nThe implementation and enforcement of PRC intellectual property laws historically have not been vigorous or consistent. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in the PRC are not as effective as those in the United States and other countries. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend patents issued to us or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. Such litigation will require significant expenditures of cash and management efforts and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, competitive position, business prospects and reputation.\nIntellectual property infringement claims may adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs we develop and introduce new products, we may be increasingly subject to claims of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property. If a claim for infringement is brought against us, such claim may require us to modify our products, cease selling certain products or engage in litigation to determine the validity and scope of such claims. Any of these events may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf our costs and demands upon management increase disproportionately to the growth of our business and revenue as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs a public company, we do and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the stock exchange on which our Common Stock is traded. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and make some activities more time consuming and costly. If our costs and demands upon management increase disproportionately to the growth of our business and revenue, our operating results could be harmed.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenue, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased income taxes, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by tax authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have retroactive effect. We currently operate through Pacific, a wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of Vanuatu and SkyPeople (China), a 99.78% owned subsidiary of Pacific organized under the laws of the PRC, and we maintain manufacturing operations in the PRC. Any of these jurisdictions could assert tax claims against us. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes. If we become subject to additional taxes in any jurisdiction, such tax treatment could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in the PRC\nInflation in the PRC could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nThe rapid growth of China\u2019s economy has been uneven among economic sectors and geographic regions of the country. China\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.7% in 2016, as measured by the year-over-year change in gross domestic product, or GDP, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. The inflation rate in China was approximately 2.0% in 2016, as reported by National Bureau of Statistics, and is expected to increase. If prices for our products and services fail to rise at a rate sufficient to compensate for the increased costs of supplies, such as raw materials, due to inflation, it may have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nFurthermore, in order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for property, plant and equipment and restrictions on state bank lending. The implementation of such policies may impede future economic growth. The People\u2019s Bank of China has effected increases in interest rates in response to inflationary concerns in the China\u2019s economy. If the central bank again raises interest rates from current levels, economic activity in China could further slow and, in turn, materially increase our costs and reduce demand for our products and services.\nWe face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations and generate most of our revenue in the PRC. Accordingly, economic, political and legal developments in the PRC will significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The PRC economy is in transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on economic conditions in the PRC. While we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and that business development in the PRC will continue to follow market forces, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case. Our interests may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC government, including:\n\u25cf changes in laws, regulations or their interpretation;\n\u25cf confiscatory taxation;\n\u25cf restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies;\n\u25cf expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises; and\n\u25cf the allocation of resources.\nAlthough the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in the PRC through the allocation of resources, controlling payments of foreign currency, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries in different ways. We cannot guarantee that the PRC government will continue to pursue policies favoring a market oriented economy or that existing policies will not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in the PRC.\nThe original incorporation of SkyPeople (China) as a joint stock company in 2001 did not obtain all required approvals from the PRC government authorities pursuant to the relevant PRC law effective at the time, and we may be subject to various penalties under the law retroactively.\nThe original incorporation of SkyPeople (China) (under the original name of Xi\u2019an Zhonglv Ecology Science and Technology Industry Co., Ltd.) as a joint stock company in 2001 was approved by the Xi\u2019an Municipal People\u2019s Government. However, according to the applicable PRC Company Law that was in force in 2001, the incorporation of SkyPeople (China) as a joint stock company shall be subject to the approval by the government authority of Shaanxi Province. Pursuant to the PRC Company Law which was in force in 2001, if company stocks is arbitrarily issued without obtaining the approval of the relevant competent authorities stipulated under the law, the parties concerned may be ordered to cease the issuance of the stock, refund the raised capital and the interests accrued therefrom, and may be subject to a fine of no less than one percent but no more than five percent of the amount of the raised capital. As such, SkyPeople (China) may be subject to any or all of the foregoing penalties as provided under the PRC Company Law effective in 2001 should the relevant government authorities choose to enforce the law retroactively.\nHowever, we believe that the regulatory authorities may consider the following factors as mitigating factors if such authorities choose to enforce the applicable laws:\n(i) the incorporation of SkyPeople (China) obtained the approval by the Xi\u2019an local government. As general practice in approval procedures, the applicants may only be able to first approach the Xi\u2019an local government authority in order to acquire the approval by a higher level government authority, and would generally rely on the Xi\u2019an local government to then submit the application to a higher level authority for its final approval; and\n(ii) the trend of the PRC Company Law is to deregulate the approvals on the incorporation of joint stock companies in China. In particular, the current PRC Company Law, effective since January 1, 2006, has eliminated the relevant approval requirement relating to the incorporation of joint stock companies. Instead, the current PRC Company Law merely requires a registration with the competent Administration for Industry and Commerce in connection with the incorporation of joint stock companies in the PRC as long as the stock is not issued to the public.\nIn addition, if needed in the future, we may make efforts to seek a written confirmation from the Shaanxi Provencal People\u2019s Government regarding its ratification of the original incorporation of SkyPeople (China) as a joint stock company.\nOur current manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental protection laws and regulations issued by the central and local governmental authorities, and we cannot guarantee that we have fully complied with all such laws and regulations. In addition, changes in the existing laws and regulations or additional or stricter laws and regulations on environmental protection in the PRC may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations.\nWe carry out our business in an industry that is subject to PRC environmental protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require enterprises engaged in manufacturing and construction that may cause environmental waste to adopt effective measures to control and properly dispose of waste gases, waste water, industrial waste, dust and other environmental waste materials, as well as fee payments from producers discharging waste substances. Fines may be levied against producers causing pollution. Although we have made efforts to comply with such laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that we have fully complied with all such laws and regulations. Except for Yingkou, all of our operating facilities hold a Pollution Emission Permit. The failure of complying with such laws or regulations may subject us to various administrative penalties such as fines. If the circumstances of the breach are serious, the central government of the PRC, including all governmental subdivisions, has the discretion to cease or close any operations failing to comply with such laws or regulations. There can also be no assurance that the PRC government will not change the existing laws or regulations or impose additional or stricter laws or regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant capital expenditure, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers through higher prices for our products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations.\nChanges in existing PRC food hygiene and safety laws may cause us to incur additional costs to comply with the more stringent laws and regulations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position.\nManufacturers within the PRC beverage industry are subject to compliance with PRC food hygiene laws and regulations. These food hygiene and safety laws require all enterprises engaged in the production of juice and other beverages to obtain a food production license for each of their production facilities. They also set out hygiene and safety standards with respect to food and food additives, packaging and containers, information to be disclosed on packaging as well as hygiene requirements for food production and sites, facilities and equipment used for the transportation and sale of food. Failure to comply with PRC food hygiene and safety laws may result in fines, suspension of operations, loss of business licenses and, in more extreme cases, criminal proceedings against an enterprise and its management. Although we comply with current food hygiene laws, in the event that the PRC government increases the stringency of such laws, our production and distribution costs may increase, which could adversely impact our financial position.\nWe benefit from various forms of government subsidies and grants, the withdrawal of which could affect our operations.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have received government subsidies from local governments. We recognized $0.03 million and $1.2 million in government subsidies for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Past government grants or subsidies are not indicative of what we will obtain in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be eligible for government grants or other forms of government support. In the event that we are no longer eligible for grants, subsidies or other government support, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nPRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain and any changes in such laws and regulations may harm our business.\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business and the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in certain circumstances. We are considered foreign persons or foreign funded enterprises under PRC laws and, as a result, we are required to comply with PRC laws and regulations related to foreign persons and foreign funded enterprises. These laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business.\nWe could be restricted from paying dividends to shareholders due to PRC laws and other contractual requirements.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the State of Florida and do not have any assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result of our holding company structure, we rely entirely on dividend payments from SkyPeople (China). PRC accounting standards and regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, a portion of which is required to be set aside for certain reserve funds. Furthermore, if SkyPeople (China) incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments. Although we do not intend to pay dividends in the future, our inability to receive all of the revenue from SkyPeople (China)\u2019s operations may provide an additional obstacle to our ability to pay dividends if we so decide in the future.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of shareholder investments.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. RMB is currently not a freely convertible currency. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to satisfy foreign currency obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. Approval from appropriate governmental authorities, however, is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the PRC government could restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due.\nThe fluctuation of the RMB may harm shareholder investments.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenue and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would diminish the value of the proceeds of the offering and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the RMB we convert would be reduced. In addition, the depreciation of significant U.S. dollar denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the value of these assets.\nPRC regulations relating to mergers and the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents, if applied to us, may limit our ability to operate our business as we see fit.\nOn August 8, 2006, six Chinese regulatory agencies, namely, MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d), SAIC, the Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d), jointly promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, generally referred to as the 2006 M&A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006. The 2006 M&A Rules, among other things, govern the approval process by which an offshore investor may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests of a Chinese domestic company. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the 2006 M&A Rules require the transaction parties to make a series of applications to the government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Under certain circumstances, government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Compliance with the 2006 M&A Rules will be more time consuming and expensive than in the past, and the government can exert more control over the combination of two businesses under the 2006 M&A Rules. As a result of any potential application of the 2006 M&A Rules, our ability to engage in business combination transactions in the PRC has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to us or sufficiently protective of our interests in a transaction.\nIn October 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside the PRC, generally referred to as Circular 75. Circular 75 requires Chinese residents to register with an applicable branch of SAFE before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of the PRC that is supported by domestic Chinese assets originally held by those residents. Following the issuance of Circular 75, SAFE issued internal implementing guidelines for Circular 75 in June 2007. These implementing guidelines, known as Notice 106, effectively expanded the reach of Circular 75 by:\n\u25cf purporting to regulate the establishment or acquisition of control by Chinese residents of offshore entities which merely acquire \u201ccontrol\u201d over domestic companies or assets, even in the absence of legal ownership;\n\u25cf adding requirements relating to the source of the Chinese resident\u2019s funds used to establish or acquire the offshore entity;\n\u25cf regulating the use of existing offshore entities for offshore financings;\n\u25cf purporting to regulate situations in which an offshore entity establishes a new subsidiary in the PRC or acquires an unrelated company or unrelated assets in the PRC;\n\u25cf making the domestic affiliate of the offshore entity responsible for the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in connection with any such registration, notably, the business plan which describes the overseas financing and the use of proceeds; and\n\u25cf requiring that the registrant establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the offshore entity and its affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nNo assurance can be given that our shareholders who are the residents as defined in Circular 75 and who own or owned our shares have fully complied with, and will continue to comply with, all applicable registration and approval requirements of Circular 75 in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisition of equity interests in our PRC based subsidiaries by virtue of our acquisition of Pacific. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Circular 75 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us following the Pacific acquisition, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, the ability of our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 75 by our Chinese resident beneficial holders. In addition, such Chinese residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 75. We have little control over our present or prospective direct or indirect shareholders /beneficial owners or the outcome of such registration procedures. If our Chinese shareholders/beneficial owners or the Chinese shareholders/beneficial owners of the target companies we acquired in the past or will acquire in the future fail to comply with Circular 75 and related regulations, and if SAFE requires it, they may be subject to fines or legal sanctions, and Chinese authorities could restrict our investment activities in the PRC, limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or pay dividends, or affect the ownership structure, which could adversely affect business and prospects.\nOur acquisition of SkyPeople (China) could constitute a Round-trip Investment under the 2006 M&A Rules.\nPrior to obtaining the MOFCOM approval on September 3, 2007 and Xi\u2019an AIC approval on October 18, 2007, and prior to the full payment of the purchase price by Pacific for 99% of SkyPeople (China)\u2019s capital stock, SkyPeople (China) was a PRC business some of whose shareholders were PRC individuals including Hongke Xue, chairman of SkyPeople (China). When Pacific was incorporated on November 30, 2006 and when the SkyPeople (China) acquisition was approved, none of the shareholders of Pacific were PRC citizens. Immediately after the consummation of the share exchange, shareholders of Pacific became our shareholders, including Fancylight, our controlling shareholder. To incentivize Mr. Hongke Xue in connection with the continuous development of SkyPeople (China)\u2019s business, a call option agreement was entered into between Fancylight and Mr. Hongke Xue on February 25, 2008 pursuant to which Mr. Xue had the opportunity to acquire a majority of our Common Stock held by Fancylight. Mr. Xue and Fancylight also entered into a voting trust agreement pursuant to which Mr. Xue has the right to vote such shares on Fancylight\u2019s behalf.\nThe PRC regulatory authorities may take the view that the SkyPeople (China) acquisition, the share exchange transaction and the call option and voting trust arrangements are part of an overall series of arrangements which constitute a round-trip investment regulated by the 2006 M&A Rules, because at the end of these transactions the same PRC individual who controlled SkyPeople (China) became the effective controlling party of a foreign entity that acquired ownership of SkyPeople (China). The PRC regulatory authorities may also take the view that the approval of the SkyPeople (China) acquisition by the MOFCOM and the registration of such acquisition with the AIC in Xi\u2019an AIC may not be evidence that the SkyPeople (China) acquisition has been properly approved because the relevant parties did not fully disclose to the MOFCOM or AIC the overall restructuring arrangements. If the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the SkyPeople (China) acquisition constitutes a round-trip investment under the 2006 M&A Rules, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the required MOFCOM approval.\nIf the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the SkyPeople (China) acquisition constitutes a round-trip investment without MOFCOM approval on such round-trip investment, they could invalidate our acquisition and ownership of SkyPeople (China).\nAdditionally, the 2006 M&A Rules also purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle (\u201c SPV\u201d) formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals shall obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV\u2019s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear, with no consensus currently existing regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement. Given that we established our PRC subsidiaries by means of direct investments, we believe that these regulations do not require an application to be submitted to the CSRC for the approval of the listing and trading of our stock on the NASDQ Global Equities, unless we are clearly required to do so by subsequently promulgated rules of the CSRC. If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC approval was required for the offerings, we may need to apply for a remedial approval from the CSRC and may be subject to certain administrative punishments or other sanctions from these regulatory agencies. The regulatory agencies may take actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our stock.\nWe believe that if this takes place, we may be able to find a way to reestablish control of SkyPeople (China)\u2019s business operations through a series of contractual arrangements rather than an outright purchase of SkyPeople (China). But we cannot guarantee that such contractual arrangements will be protected by PRC law or that we can receive as complete or effective economic benefit and overall control of SkyPeople (China)\u2019s business than if we had direct ownership of SkyPeople (China). In addition, we cannot guarantee that such contractual arrangements can be successfully implemented under PRC law. If we cannot obtain approval from MOFCOM and/or CSRC if required by the PRC regulatory authorities to do so, and if we cannot put in place or enforce relevant contractual arrangements as an alternative and equivalent means of control of SkyPeople (China), our business and financial performance will be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States, it may be difficult for investors to use U.S. securities laws to enforce their rights against us, our officers and some of our directors in the United States or to enforce judgments of United States courts against us or them in the PRC.\nAll of our present officers and directors reside outside of the United States. In addition, SkyPeople (China) is located in the PRC and substantially all of its assets are located outside of the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws against us in the courts of either the United States or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in courts of the United States, to enforce such judgments in the PRC courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties under the U.S. Federal securities laws or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock, which may be issued without shareholder approval and which may adversely affect the rights of holders of our Common Stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board is authorized under our articles of incorporation, as amended, to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock by resolution and by filing a certificate of designations under Florida law, to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series of preferred stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The Board previously designated and issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock which were automatically converted into our Common Stock upon the effective date of our two-for-three reverse split and returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock following the reverse split. As of December 31, 2016 there were no shares of Series A preferred stock issued and outstanding. Any shares of preferred stock that are issued are likely to have priority over our Common Stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized under certain circumstances as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control, which could have the effect of discouraging bids to acquire us and thereby prevent shareholders from receiving the maximum value for their shares. We have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock in order to discourage or delay a change of control or for any other reason. However, there can be no assurance that preferred stock will not be issued at some time in the future.\nYongke Xue has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock.\nYongke Xue, a member of the Board of Directors, indirectly and beneficially owns 80% equity interest in SkyPeople International Holdings Group Limited (\u201cSP International\u201d), and also serves as the sole director of SP International. In turn, as of December 31, 2016, SP International indirectly owns 13,375,639 shares, or 50.2%, of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Yongke Xue will be able to exercise voting rights with respect to these shares of common stock, and has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock. As a board member, Mr. Yongke Xue owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yongke Xue is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Florida law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe are a Florida corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act may discourage, delay or prevent certain changes in control unless such change in control is approved by a majority of our disinterested shareholders. In addition, the terms of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that shareholders may consider favorable. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by the Board to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf require that directors only be removed from office upon a majority shareholder vote;\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u25cf limit who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\n\u25cf prohibit shareholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders.\nFor more information regarding these and other provisions, see the section titled \u201cDescription of Our Securities - Anti-Takeover Effects of Florida Law and Provisions of Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.\u201d\nIn the past, our Common Stock has been in danger of being delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d).\nOn each of April 20, 2016, May 24, 2016 and August 17, 2016, the Company received a notification letter from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ (the \u201cStaff\u201d) indicating that the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements because the Company was not in compliance with the NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the \u201cRule\u201d) with respect to certain of its annual and current reports.\nOn October 12, 2016, the Company received a delisting determination letter (the \u201cDetermination Letter\u201d) from the Staff notifying the Company that because the Company had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the \u201cForm 10-K\u201d) and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, (together, the \u201cReports\u201d) by October 11, 2016, the deadline by which the Company was to file all Reports in order to regain compliance with the Rule, the Company\u2019s common stock was subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Market. The Determination Letter further noted that unless the Company requested an appeal of the Staff\u2019s determination no later than 4:00 pm Eastern Time on October 19, 2016, trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market would be suspended at the opening of business on October 21, 2016, and a Form 25-NSE would be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) removing the Company\u2019s securities from listing and registration on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nOn October 19, 2016, the Company requested a hearing before the NASDAQ Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d) under Listing Rule 5815(a) to appeal the delisting determination from the Staff. On November 2, 2016, the Company was granted an extended stay as to the suspension of the Company's shares from trading by the Panel until the Company's scheduled hearing before the Panel on December 15, 2016 and issuance of a final Panel decision. Following a hearing, the Panel required that the Company regain compliance by January 31, 2017. By letter dated February 2, 2017, the Panel notified the Company that (i) the Company had regained compliance, (ii) the Company\u2019s Common Stock would continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, and (iii) the Panel was closing the matter.", "PERMNO": 93069, "SIC": 2080, "TIC": "FTFT"}
