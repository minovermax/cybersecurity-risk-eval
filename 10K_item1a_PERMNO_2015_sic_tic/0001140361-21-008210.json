RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information provided in this Form 10 K in considering whether to make or continue to hold an investment in our Common Stock. The risks described below are those we currently believe may materially affect us. An investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk, and should be considered only by persons who can afford the loss of their entire investment. Although we believe that these risks are the most important for you to consider, you should read this section in conjunction with our financial statements, the notes to those financial statements and our management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our periodic reports and incorporated into this Form 10 K by reference.\nRISK FACTORS SUMMARY\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. The risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, the risks summarized below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\u25cf the refocus of our business strategy to respond to COVID-19, including the successful development and market acceptance of the DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG System, the DPP SARS CoV 2 Antigen System and the DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel, which we refer to as the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems;\n\u25cf our allocation of substantially all of our resources to the development and production of COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems;\n\u25cf the effects of existing or future shareholder litigation;\n\u25cf our competitors developing more effective or successful products;\n\u25cf the ability of our products to compete with the new or existing products of our competitors;\n\u25cf the negative impact of healthcare industry consolidation on our future revenues and operating results;\n\u25cf our ability to retain key employees and attract additional qualified personnel;\n\u25cf third-party reimbursement policies;

and\n\u25cf basing our estimates or judgments relate to critical accounting policies on assumptions that can change or prove to be incorrect.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\u25cf our ability to protect our proprietary technology; and\n\u25cf the effect of future intellectual property disputes on our ability to sell products or use certain technologies.\nRisks Related to Our Third Party Collaborators\n\u25cf our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers, for critical components and materials;\n\u25cf the limitation on rights we receive from collaborations with strategic collaborators, and the exposure to risks outside of our control due to such collaborations;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain existing distribution channels or develop new distribution channels; and\n\u25cf our compliance with U.S. government contracts.\nRisks Related to Regulations\n\u25cf the impact of changes in CLIA, FDA, ANVISA, and other regulatory changes, on COVID-19 diagnostic tests;\n\u25cf our ability to receive and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our products, particularly the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems;\n\u25cf the impact of governmental export controls on our ability to compete in international markets;\n\u25cf our ability to comply with FDA and other regulatory requirements, particularly with respect to the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems;\n\u25cf our ability to respond to changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the effect of FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests and genetic testing on demand for our products;\n\u25cf disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies affecting the ability of the FDA to hire, retain or deploy key leadership or personal or otherwise could prevent new and modified products from being developed, cleared, approved, authorized or commercialized;\n\u25cf ongoing changes in healthcare regulation;\n\u25cf a reduction or elimination in the types of government awards that partially support some of our programs;\n\u25cf compliance with privacy, security and breach notification regulations;\n\u25cf our ability to manufacture products in accordance with applicable requirements;\n\u25cf the effect of healthcare fraud and abuse laws on our business; and\n\u25cf increased exposure to regulatory, cultural and other challenges due to international expansion.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Common Stock\n\u25cf the limited liquidity of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf the volatility of the price of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf the effect of future issuances of Common Stock on the price of our Common Stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings;\n\u25cf the control management and larger stockholders exercise over us; and\n\u25cf the depression of the market price of our common stock due to sale by existing stockholders, executive officers or directors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u25cf our ability to successfully generate the expected benefits of our acquisitions; and\n\u25cf developments related to the U.K.\u2019s referendum on membership in the E.U.; and\n\u25cf legislative and regulatory changes.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have refocused our business strategy to respond to COVID-19, which is a new and rapidly developing market, making it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.\nThe market for COVID-19 diagnostic testing is new and rapidly developing, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced in rapidly changing industries, including those related to:\n\u25cf our ability to compete with companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the market for our products;\n\u25cf our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully expand our business;\n\u25cf our ability to meet customer demand;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly sales and manufacturing expenses, related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions in our markets.\nGiven the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential size of this market and the timing of its development remains highly uncertain. Our future success is dependent on the manner in which the market for COVID-19 diagnostics develops. If the market develops in a manner that does not facilitate the inclusion of our products, or fails to grow in the manner in which we expect, our business may not continue to grow.\nWe are allocating substantially all of our resources to the development and production of COVID-19 Test Systems for the foreseeable future, and our long-term business success could be negatively impacted by our diversion of resources from our legacy business of diagnostic testing for other infectious diseases.\nWe are committing substantially all of our financial and personnel resources to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems. This resource allocation may negatively impact our legacy product portfolio, as we expect to spend limited funds and time on updating pre-existing products and regulatory approvals or on completing products that were in development prior to our strategic decision to focus on COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could dissipate; there is no guarantee that current or anticipated demand will continue, or if demand does continue, that we will be able to produce in quantities to meet the demand. We intend to reestablish our legacy business in the future, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recommence the development and commercialization of our legacy products and products under development.\nOur near-term success is highly dependent on the success of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, and we cannot be certain that we will succeed in developing one or more of those systems or that, if we do, they will attain market acceptance or be successfully commercialized in the United States or elsewhere.\nWe do not currently have an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, and we do not currently have an application pending for any such EUA. Moreover, market and regulatory requirements continue to change at a rapid pace. The FDA has declined to review certain of our COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems based on then-effective prioritization guidance, which is subject to change. There can be no assurance that, if we are to make a submission of any future EUA application, we will meet the requirements of the prioritization guidance in effect at the time of the submission or otherwise be successful in obtaining an EUA that would permit us to offer and sell any COVID-19 Diagnostic Test System in the United States.\nEven if we are able to obtain an EUA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, including our revised DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG System and DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System that product may not gain broad market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payers, patients, and the medical community. We have conducted our own research into the markets for our product candidates, including the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems; however, we cannot guarantee market acceptance of our product, and have somewhat limited information on which to estimate our anticipated level of sales. Our products will require healthcare providers and doctors to accept and adopt our technology. Our industry is susceptible to rapid technological developments and there can be no assurance that we will be able to match any new technological advances. If we are unable to match the technological changes in the needs of our customers the demand for our products will be reduced. Acceptance and use of any products we market will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u25cf perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u25cf limitation on use or warnings required by FDA in our product labeling;\n\u25cf cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u25cf convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf potential advantages of alternative treatment methods;\n\u25cf availability of reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payers; and\n\u25cf effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nBecause we expect virtually all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future to be generated from sales of our current products and COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems in particular, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would substantially harm our business and would adversely affect our revenue. If the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems are not as successfully commercialized as expected, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. Any failure of either of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems to be successfully commercialized in the United States may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating result financial condition and cash flows, and could result in a substantial decline in the price of our common stock.\nThe diagnostic testing market, particularly with respect to COVID-19, is highly competitive, and many of our competitors are larger, better established and have greater technical and marketing capabilities and financial and other resources than we have.\nThe diagnostics market, particularly with respect to COVID-19 diagnostic tests, is highly competitive and we face substantial competition based on factors such as product quality, analytical performance, ease of use, price, customer service and reputation. Industry competition is also based the following additional factors:\n\u25cf patent protection;\n\u25cf scientific expertise;\n\u25cf ability to develop and market products and processes;\n\u25cf ability to obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf ability to manufacture cost-effective products that meet applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf access to adequate capital; and\n\u25cf ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nNumerous companies in the United States and internationally have announced their intention to offer new products, services and technologies that could be used in substitution for the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems. Many of those competitors are significantly larger, and have substantially greater financial, engineering and other resources, than us. In addition, our competitors may have or may develop products or technologies that currently or in the future will enable them to produce competitive products with greater capabilities or at lower costs than ours. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may fail to meet our strategic objectives, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. In addition, the production of an efficacious vaccine or other treatment for COVID-19 may reduce the demand for diagnostic products. The success or failure, or perceived success or failure, of other companies may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding, or to ultimately commercialize the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems.\nShareholder litigation could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of existing and any future shareholder litigation, including four shareholder lawsuits to date that have been brought against us. See Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below for additional information regarding these lawsuits. These lawsuits or other future litigation may adversely affect the ability of our technical and management personnel, and our directors, to perform their normal responsibilities. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of obligations to our directors.\nWe expect competition to with respect to testing solutions for COVID-19 to continue to increase and our success will depend on widespread market acceptance of our products.\nWe expect competition to continue to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products, services and technologies are introduced. The entrance of new competitors is being encouraged by governmental authorities, which are offering funding to support development of testing solutions for COVID-19. Some of our existing or new competitors may have strong relationships with current and potential customers, including governmental authorities, and, as a result, may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing regulatory requirements, new or emerging technologies, and changes in customer requirements. Our products may not compete favorably, and we may not be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and technologies introduced by our existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. Any failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could affect our suppliers and employees, and cause disruptions in current and future plans for operations and expansion.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may directly and indirectly adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. The extent to which this will continue will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted with precision or certainty at this time.\nOur business may be disrupted due to the costs incurred as a result of additional necessary actions and preparedness plans to help ensure the health and safety of our employees and continued operations, including enhanced cleaning processes, protocols designed to implement appropriate social distancing practices, and/or adoption of additional wage and benefit programs to assist employees. We may also have difficulty meeting demand for our products if our employees are affected by COVID-19, or if we do not have adequate space to produce our product with social distancing practices implemented. We also cannot predict the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain\u2019s reliability and costs,\nIn addition, our business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers, may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic, including the related response, could cause disruptions due to potential suspension or slowdown of activities at our third-party suppliers, or increased prices implemented by our suppliers. The adverse effect on our employees or suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a fragmented, segmented, and rapidly changing industry, which is highly competitive with respect to numerous factors, and our success depends on our ability compete effectively with larger companies, develop new or enhance existing products, as well as acceptance of DPP over more traditional diagnostic platform technologies.\nImportant competitive factors for our products include price, quality, performance, ease of use, and customer service. A few large corporations produce a wide variety of diagnostic tests and other medical devices and equipment. A larger number of mid-size companies generally compete only in the diagnostic industry and a significant number of small companies produce only a few diagnostic products. As a result, the diagnostic test industry is highly fragmented and segmented.\nMore generally, the point-of-care diagnostics industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. As new technologies become introduced into the point-of-care diagnostic testing market, we may be required to commit considerable additional efforts, time and resources to enhance our current product portfolio or develop new products. We may not have the available time and resources to accomplish this, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which would materially harm our operating results.\nAlthough we own DPP patents, lateral flow technology is still a competitive platform to DPP, and lateral flow technology has a lower cost of manufacture than DPP products. Although the DPP platform has shown improved sensitivity as compared with conventional lateral flow platforms in a number of studies, several factors go into the development and performance attributes of products. Therefore the ability of our products to successfully compete will depend on several other factors, including our having a patented rapid test platform technology that differentiates DPP from lateral flow as well as from other diagnostic platform technologies.\nThere can be no assurance that our DPP patents or our products incorporating those patents will not be challenged at some time in the future.\nOur competitors may develop and commercialize more effective or successful products, and our research, development and commercialization efforts may not succeed.\nWe regularly commit substantial resources to research and development and the commercialization of our new or enhanced products. The research and development process usually takes a long time from inception to commercial launch. During each stage of this process there is a substantial risk that we will not achieve our goals in a timely fashion, or at all, and we may have to abandon a new or enhanced product in which we have invested substantial time and money. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to our research and development activities.\nOur products require significant development and investment prior to commercialization, including testing to demonstrate the products\u2019 performance capabilities, cost-effectiveness or other benefits. We must obtain regulatory approval before most products may be sold and additional development efforts on these products may be required before the products will be reviewed. However, regulatory authorities may not approve these products for commercial sale or may substantially delay or condition such approval. There may be little or no market for the product and entry into or development of new markets for our products may require an investment of substantial resources even if all applicable regulatory approvals are obtained. Furthermore, we may spend a significant amount of money on advertising or other activities and still fail to develop a market for the product. The success of our efforts may be affected by our ability to manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, whether we can obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protection and our ability to obtain reimbursement authorizations in the markets where the product will be sold. Therefore, if we fail to develop and gain commercial acceptance for our products, or if competitors develop more effective products or a greater number of successful new products, customers may decide not to purchase our products.\nOur products may not be able to compete with new diagnostic products or existing products developed by well-established competitors, which would negatively affect our business.\nThe diagnostic industry is focused on the testing of biological specimens in a laboratory or at the point-of-care and is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Important competitive factors for our products include price, quality, performance, ease of use, and customer service.\nA few large corporations produce a wide variety of diagnostic tests and other medical devices and equipment. A larger number of mid-size companies generally compete only in the diagnostic industry and a significant number of small companies produce only a few diagnostic products. As a result, the diagnostic test industry is highly fragmented and segmented.\nSome of our principal competitors may have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several companies produce diagnostic tests that compete directly with our testing product line, including Abbott (Alere), OraSure Technologies and Trinity Biotech. Some competitors offer broader product lines and may have greater name recognition than we have. These and other companies have or may have products incorporating molecular or other advanced technologies that over time could directly compete with our testing product line. We also face competition from certain of our distributors or former customers that have created or may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours.\nAs new products incorporating new technologies enter the market, our products may become obsolete or a competitor\u2019s products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold. If our competitors\u2019 products take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, our revenues, margins and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted if some of our customers internally develop or acquire their own sample collection devices and use those devices in place of our products in order to reduce costs.\nOur future revenues and operating results may be negatively affected by ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry.\nThere has been a significant amount of consolidation in the healthcare industry. This consolidation has increased the competition to provide goods and services to customers. In addition, group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Due to ongoing consolidation, there could be additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nOur continued growth depends on retaining our current key employees and attracting additional qualified personnel, and we may not be able to do so.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the skills and experience of our executive officers, sales, marketing, operations and scientific staff. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical products businesses and academic and other research institutions, as well as to geographic considerations, our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, and other reasons.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to effectively manufacture, sell and market our products to meet the demands of our customers and strategic partners in a timely fashion, or to support internal research and development programs.\nWe have entered into employment contracts with our Chief Executive Officer, Richard Eberly, our Chief Science & Technology Officer, Javan Esfandiari, and our Chief Financial Officer, Neil Goldman. Due to the specific knowledge and experience of these executives regarding the industry, technology and market generally and to our company specifically, the loss of the services of any one of these executives could have a material adverse effect on us. We have not obtained a key man insurance policy on any officer other than Mr. Esfandiari.\nWe may not generate the expected benefits of our acquisitions of opTricon GmbH or Orangelife Comercio e Industria Ltda. and the ongoing integration of the acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and increase our expenses.\nWe acquired opTricon GmbH, or opTricon, and Orangelife Comercio e Industria Ltda., or Orangelife, in November 2018 and November 2019, respectively, with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits, including securing global commercial rights and reducing cost of goods. Achieving the anticipated benefits of either acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether our business and the businesses of opTricon or Orangelife can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately forecast the performance or ultimate impact of either the opTricon acquisition or the Orangelife acquisition.\nThe integration processes may take longer than anticipated and result in the loss of valuable employees, the incurrence of additional and unforeseen expenses, the disruption of our ongoing business, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems. The integration processes are subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits, expense savings and synergies will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur non-recurring expenses in connection with the opTricon acquisition and the Orangelife acquisition, including legal, accounting and other expenses. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred following consummation of the opTricon acquisition or the Orangelife acquisition in the course of the integration of the respective businesses into our business. We cannot be certain that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all, or any losses from undiscovered liabilities not covered by an indemnification from the sellers of opTricon or Orangelife.\nThird-party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints could negatively affect our business.\nThe potential end-users of our products include hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. If these end-users do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products from their patients\u2019 healthcare insurers or payors, the use of our products could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the net sales of our products could also be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors.\nHospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers who purchase diagnostic products in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, such as private health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product. Due to the overall escalating cost of medical products and services, especially in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and its straining of healthcare systems across the globe, there is increased pressure on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the United States, available levels of reimbursement may change for our existing products or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, and regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors, may reduce the demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nTo the extent that we are unable to collect our outstanding accounts receivable, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nThere may be circumstances and timing that require us to accept payment terms, including delayed payment terms, from distributors or customers, which, if not satisfied, could cause financial losses.\nWe generally accept payment terms which require us to ship product before the contract price has been paid fully, and there also are circumstances pursuant to which we may accept further delayed payment terms pursuant to which we may continue to deliver product. To the extent that these circumstances result in significant accounts receivables and those accounts receivables are not paid on a timely basis, or are not paid at all, especially if concentrated in one or two customers, we could suffer financial losses.\nWe believe our success depends in part on the continued funding of, and our ability to participate in, large testing programs in the U.S. And worldwide, the funding of which may be reduced or discontinued or otherwise be unavailable to us.\nWe believe it to be in our best interests to meaningfully participate in large testing programs. Moreover many of these programs are funded by governments and other donors, and there can be no assurance that funding will not be reduced or completely discontinued. Participation in these programs also requires alignment and engagement with the many other participants in these programs, including WHO, CDC, the U.S. Agency for International Development, foreign governments and their agencies, non-governmental organizations, and HIV service organizations. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to participate in these programs, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nIn December 2013 President Obama signed into law the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act, which is the most recent reauthorization of PEPFAR. However, unlike the 2008 PEPFAR authorization, which authorized approximately $45 billion in funding, the new law did not authorize a specific dollar amount for funding.\nDeveloping testing guidelines could negatively affect sales of our products.\nGovernment agencies may issue diagnostic testing guidelines or recommendations, which can alter the usage of our HIV testing products. New laws or guidelines, or changes to existing laws or guidelines, and the manner in which these new or changed laws and guidelines are interpreted and applied, could impact the degree to which our testing products are used. These developments could affect the frequency of testing, the number of people tested and whether the testing products are used broadly for screening large populations or in a more limited capacity. These factors could in turn affect the level of sales of our products and our results of operations.\nSome of our programs are partially supported by government grant awards, which may not be available to us in the future.\nWe have received funding under grant award programs funded by governmental agencies such as NIDA and BARDA. To fund a portion of our future research and development programs, we may apply for additional grant funding from these or similar governmental agencies. However, funding by these governmental agencies may be significantly reduced or eliminated in the future for a number of reasons. For example, some programs are subject to a yearly appropriations process in Congress. In addition, we may not receive full funding under current or future grants because of budgeting constraints of the agency administering the program or unsatisfactory progress on the study being funded. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will receive any future grant funding from any government agencies, or, that if received, we will receive the full amount of the particular grant award. Any such reductions could delay the development of our product candidates and the introduction of new products.\nWe could be exposed to liability if we experience security breaches or other disruptions, which could harm our reputation and business.\nWe may be subject to cyber-attacks whereby computer hackers may attempt to access our computer systems or our third party IT service provider\u2019s systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential information, particularly if we gain recognition in our industry. In addition, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures or obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving sensitive information. We will continue to evaluate and implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk and detect cyber incidents, but cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. Even though we take cyber-security measures that are continuously reviewed and updated, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable due to sophisticated attacks by hackers or breaches.\nEven the most well protected IT networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in security breaches are continually evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and, in fact, may not be detected. Any such compromise of our or our third party\u2019s IT service providers\u2019 data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information, could result in legal claims proceedings, liability under laws to protect, privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result, damage our reputation and customers willingness to transact business with us, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to efficiently operate our business is reliant on information technology, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our business.\nWe rely heavily on complex information technology systems across our operations and on the internet, including for management of inventory, invoices, purchase orders, shipping, interactions with our third-party logistics provider, revenue and expense accounting, consumer call support, online business, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products, respond to customer inquiries, and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and the internet.\nIf any of the foregoing systems fails to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or disruptions in the operation of the internet, could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations. Significant expenditures could be required to fix any such problem.\nIf there is an increase in demand for our products, it could require us to expend considerable resources or harm our customer relationships if we are unable to meet that demand.\nIf there are significant or unexpected increases in the demand for our products, we may not be able to meet that demand without expending additional capital resources. This would increase our capital costs, which could negatively affect our earnings in the short term. In addition, new manufacturing equipment or facilities may require FDA, WHO, and other regulatory approvals before they can be used to manufacture our products. To the extent we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining such approvals, our ability to meet the demand for our products could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our suppliers may be unable or unwilling to expend the necessary capital resources or otherwise expand their capacity, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we or our suppliers are unable to develop necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner. If we fail to increase production volumes in a cost effective manner or if we experience lower than anticipated yields or production problems as a result of changes that we or our suppliers make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand, we could experience shipment delays or interruptions and increased manufacturing costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nIf there are unexpected increases in demand for our products, we may be required to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the increase in demand. However, some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. It is also possible that one or more of our suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials to us. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components, or our inability to quickly and cost-effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet increased demand for our products. This could negatively affect our total revenues or cost of sales and related profits.\nIf we are unable to meet customer demand for our products, it could also harm our relationships with our customers and impair our reputation within the industry. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur management and larger stockholders exercise significant control over us.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2% of our outstanding common stock was beneficially owned by our executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders including three large investors that beneficially own 18%, of our outstanding common stock. For the foreseeable future, and assuming these ownership percentages continue to apply, to the extent that these parties vote similarly, they may be able to exercise significant control over many matters requiring approval by the board of directors or our stockholders. As a result, they may be able to:\n\u25cf control the composition of our board of directors;\n\u25cf control our management and policies;\n\u25cf determine the outcome of significant corporate transactions, including changes in control that may be beneficial to stockholders; and,\n\u25cf act in each of their own interests, which may conflict with or differ from the interests of each other or the interests of the other stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nOur COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems may not gain wide industry acceptance, and industry adoption of alternative technology could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully.\nOf the 171 manufacturers and commercial laboratories to receive an EUA for COVID-19 diagnostics as of July 31, 2020, 35 were for serology tests, 134 were for molecular tests, and 2 were for antigen tests. Customers or the industry as a whole could adopt alternative technologies for testing, including molecular point-of-care testing, which could result in lower demand for our antigen test. Various advances in the treatment and monitoring of patients could cause lower demand for the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, including our revised DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System or for antigen testing for COVID-19 as a whole.\nCOVID-19 is prone to genetic mutations which may impact the ability of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems to adequately detect COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 antigens and could adversely affect demand for the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems and harm our competitive position.\nFalse test results are a risk with all laboratory tests, including COVID-19 diagnostic tests. False results can occur in the presence or absence of a mutation in the COVID-19 virus. In the presence of a mutation in the virus, false results can occur if a mutation occurs in the region of the virus that the test is designed to assess. False results may occur with the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems in the presence or absence of one or more COVID-19 mutations. If false negatives occur with the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, it will may reduce customer confidence in the accuracy of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems and harm our competitive position.\nFor our business to succeed in the future, our current and future products must receive market acceptance.\nMarket acceptance and the timing of such acceptance, of our new products or technologies is necessary for our future success. To achieve market acceptance, we and our distributors will likely be required to undertake substantial efforts and spend significant funds to inform every one of the existence and perceived benefits of our products. We also may require government funding for the purchase of our products to help create market acceptance and expand the use of our products.\nIt may be difficult evaluate the market reaction to our products and our marketing efforts for new products may not be successful. The government funding we receive may be limited for new products. As such, there can be no assurance that any products will obtain significant market acceptance and fill the market need that is perceived to exist on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to effectively introduce and market our products, which could materially harm our operating results.\nIntroducing and achieving market acceptance for our new products will require substantial marketing efforts and will require us and/or our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors to make significant expenditures of time and money. In some instances we will be significantly or totally reliant on the marketing efforts and expenditures of our contract partners, sales agents, and distributors. If they do not have or commit the expertise and resources to effectively market the products that we manufacture, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nNew developments in health treatments and non-diagnostic products may reduce or eliminate the demand for our products.\nThe development and commercialization of products outside of the diagnostics industry could adversely affect sales of our products. For example, the development of a safe and effective vaccine to HIV or treatments for other diseases or conditions that our products are designed to detect, could reduce or eventually eliminate the demand for our HIV or other diagnostic products and result in a loss of revenues.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to increase manufacturing production capacity through the implementation of additional customized manufacturing automation equipment.\nOne of our key challenges will be to increase our production capacity to meet sales demand while maintaining product quality and reducing production costs. Our primary strategy to accomplish this consists of the implementation of additional customized automation equipment. The equipment we order may not be delivered in a timely manner, and, once delivered, the equipment may require significant time and effort in order to operate in the manner required to produce high quality products. We experienced significant unexpected delays before our current automation equipment operated in the manner for which it was designed. The investments we make in this equipment may not yield the anticipated labor and material efficiencies. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to timely obtain automation equipment that meets our requirements or if there are significant increases in the costs of equipment.\nSales cycles for our products can be lengthy, which can cause variability and unpredictability in our business.\nSome of our products may require lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles, which makes it more difficult to accurately forecast revenues in a given period and may cause revenues and operating results to vary from period to period. Our products may involve sales to large public and private institutions which may require many levels of approval and may be dependent on economic or political conditions and the availability of grants or funding from government or public health agencies which can vary from period to period. There can be no assurance that purchases or funding from these agencies will occur or continue, especially if current negative economic conditions continue or intensify. As a result, we may expend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or we may not be able to complete transactions at all or on a schedule and in an amount consistent with our objectives.\nWe may face product liability claims for injuries.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease sales of our products. We cannot be sure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of the policy limits of our existing product liability insurance coverage or that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost, or at all. In addition, a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injury and otherwise. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur customers may not adopt rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing.\nRapid point-of-care tests are beneficial because, among other things, they can be administered by healthcare providers in their own facilities or used by consumers at home without sending samples to central laboratories. But currently the majority of diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers in the U.S. are provided by clinical reference laboratories and hospital-based laboratories. In some international markets, such as Europe, diagnostic testing is performed primarily by centralized laboratories. Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on our ability to expand market acceptance of rapid point-of-care testing and successfully compete against laboratory testing methods and products. However, we expect that clinical reference and other hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our rapid point-of-care products. Even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective, save time, or have better performance or other benefits, physicians, other healthcare providers and consumers may resist changing to rapid point-of-care tests and instead may choose to obtain diagnostic results through laboratory tests. If we fail to achieve and expand market acceptance of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests with customers, it would have a negative effect on our future sales growth.\nCustomer concentration creates risks for our business.\nA significant portion of our revenues each year comes from a few large customers. To the extent that such a large customer fails to meet its purchase commitments, changes its ordering patterns or business strategy, or otherwise reduces its purchases or stops purchasing our products, or if we experience difficulty in meeting the demand by these customers for our products, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our products do not perform properly, it may affect our revenues, stock price and reputation.\nOur products may not perform as expected. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic products or a failure by a customer to follow proper testing procedures may cause the product to report inaccurate information. Identifying the root cause of a product performance or quality issue can be difficult and time consuming.\nIf our products do not to perform in accordance with the applicable label claims or otherwise in accordance with the expectations or needs of our customers, customers may switch to a competing product or otherwise stop using our products, and our revenues could be negatively affected. If this occurs, we may be required to implement holds or product recalls and incur warranty obligations. Furthermore, the poor performance by one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on our reputation, our continuing ability to sell products and the price of our Common Stock.\nFinancial, Economic and Financing Risks\nWe have incurred losses in recent years and we are uncertain about our future profitability.\nWe incurred an operating loss every year from 2014 through 2020. Under our operating plans, we have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in our production capacity, including in expanding facilities and automating manufacturing, and in our sales and marketing, regulatory approval, and research and development activities. Our ability to achieve profitability and generate cash flow in the future will depend on our ability to increase sales of our existing products and to successfully introduce new and enhanced products into the marketplace, all while controlling and managing our expenses consistent with our operating plan.\nIf we are unable to increase our revenues and manage our expenses in accordance with our operating plan, our operating results would be harmed and we may not be able to generate the cash flow needed to fund the investments in our production capacity and other activities, we will be required to implement one or both of the following:\n\u25cf We could reduce the level, or otherwise delay the timing, of the anticipated investments in our production capacity and other activities, which would likely curtail or delay the growth in our business contemplated by our operating plan and could impair or defer our ability to achieve profitability and generate cash flow.\n\u25cf We could raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements, to the extent funding would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. Furthermore, the holders of these new securities or debt may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our Common Stock.\nIn such circumstances, we also would need to forego acquisition opportunities, which could impede our ability to grow our business.\nOur financial results may fluctuate.\nFrom quarter to quarter and year to year, our operating results can fluctuate, which could cause our growth or financial performance to fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts. Sales to our distributors and other customers may not meet expectations because of lower than expected customer demand or other factors, including continued economic volatility and disruption, reduced governmental funding, and other circumstances described elsewhere in this report. A variety of factors could also contribute to the variability of our financial results, including infrequent, unusual or unexpected changes in revenues or costs.\nDifferent products provide dissimilar contributions to our gross product margin. Accordingly, our operating results could also fluctuate and be negatively affected by the mix of products sold and the relative prices and gross product margin contribution of those products. Failure to achieve operating results consistent with the expectations of investors and securities analysts could adversely affect our reputation and the price of our Common Stock.\nThe failure to comply with the terms of our Credit Agreement and Guaranty could result in a default under its terms and, if uncured, could result in action against our pledged assets and dilution of our stockholders.\nOn September 3, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty, or Credit Agreement, with Perceptive Credit Holdings II, LP, or Perceptive. Under the Credit Agreement, we received a $20,000,000 senior secured term loan credit facility, which was drawn in full on September 4, 2019. The credit agreement is secured by a first priority, perfected lien on substantially all of our property and assets, including our equity interests in our subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The Credit Agreement restricts our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u25cf incur, assume or guarantee additional Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement);\n\u25cf repurchase capital stock;\n\u25cf make other restricted payments including, without limitation, paying dividends and making investments;\n\u25cf create liens;\n\u25cf sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u25cf enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries;\n\u25cf enter into mergers or consolidations; and\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement also contain covenants requiring us and our subsidiaries to maintain cash and cash equivalents held in one or more accounts subject to the first priority perfected security interests of the lenders under the Credit Agreement of not less than $3,000,000. The Credit Agreement also provides for specified quarterly minimum consolidated net revenue covenants of us and our subsidiaries for the trailing twelve-month period ended on each such calculation date during the term of the Credit Agreement. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the Credit Agreement. If an event of default under our Credit Agreements occurs, Perceptive could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to pay such amounts, Perceptive could proceed against the collateral pledged to them. We have pledged our inventory, accounts receivable, cash, securities, other general intangibles and the capital stock of certain subsidiaries to the lenders. In such an event, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient assets to pay amounts due under the Credit Agreement.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our debt depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, to fund planned capital expenditures, and to maintain sufficient working capital depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our operations used $18.9 million in cash. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt, we may need seek additional capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before the maturity thereof, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that, if needed, we would be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that the terms of that debt will allow any of the above alternative measures or that these measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to repay or refinance our debt on favorable terms, it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any financing when needed.\nThe LIBOR calculation method may change, and LIBOR is expected to be phased out after 2021, which may adversely affect our interest expenses under the Credit Agreement and Guaranty.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement and Guaranty bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (a) the greater of the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, and 2.5% plus (b) 8.75%. At any time at which an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the interest rate will increase by 4.0%. Accrued interest is payable on a monthly basis. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, or IBA, the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.\nAt this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a newly created index, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement and Guaranty, if LIBOR becomes unavailable in the future, the Administrative Agent and Borrower (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement and Guaranty) may select an alternative benchmark rate, which may include SOFR. To the extent our interest rates increase as a result, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\nOur operating results may be negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn the past our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material. Nevertheless, sales of our products are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. The fluctuations in the exchange rate could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions.\nThe revenues and expenses of Chembio Diagnostics Malaysia, opTricon and Orangelife, one of our subsidiaries, are recorded in Malaysian Ringgit, in Euros and Brazilian Real, respectively. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. Our expectation is that the Chembio Diagnostics Malaysia, opTricon and Orangelife businesses will continue to grow and, consequently, our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates may grow as well.\nOur foreign subsidiaries\u2019 revenues and expenses and the translation of their financial results into U.S. dollars may be negatively affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate. Favorable movement in exchange rates have benefited us in prior periods. However, where there are unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, our consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected. Furthermore, fluctuations in exchange rates could affect year-to-year comparability of operating results. In the past, we have not generally entered into hedging instruments to manage our currency exchange rate risk, but we may need to do so in the future. However, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully hedge against unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, our consolidated financial results may be adversely impacted.\nWe operate in countries where there is or may be widespread corruption.\nWe have a policy in place prohibiting our employees, distributors and agents from engaging in corrupt business practices, including activities prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Nevertheless, because we work through independent sales agents and distributors outside the United States, we do not have control over the day-to-day activities of such independent agents and distributors. In addition, in the donor-funded markets in Africa where we sell our products, there is significant oversight from PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and advisory committees comprised of technical experts concerning the development and establishment of national testing protocols. This is a process that includes an overall assessment of a product which includes extensive product performance evaluations including five active collaborations and manufacturer\u2019s quality systems, as well as price and delivery. In Brazil, where we operate our subsidiary Orangelife and have had numerous product collaborations with FIOCRUZ, the programs through which our products may be deployed are all funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Although FIOCRUZ is affiliated with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and is its sole customer, FIOCRUZ is not the exclusive supplier for the Ministry of Health. However, because each of our previous collaborations with FIOCRUZ incorporates a technology transfer aspect, we believe we have a competitive advantage versus other suppliers to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, assuming other aspects of our product offering through FIOCRUZ are otherwise competitive in comparison. We have no knowledge or reason to know of any activities by our employees, distributors or sales agents of any actions which could be in violation of the FCPA, although there can be no assurance of this.\nOur subsidiary Chembio Diagnostics Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. is located in Malaysia. There have been numerous high-profile corruption cases, and corruption is one of the most problematic factors for doing business in Malaysia. While the Malaysian government has acknowledged the problem, it appears that endemic corruption is continuing and that market-based principles are not applied in cases involving individuals with high-level political access. To the extent bribery and similar practices continue to exist in Malaysia, U.S. companies such as ours, which are subject to U.S. laws making it illegal to pay bribes to foreign officials, may make us less competitive in winning business in Malaysia when competing with non-U.S. companies.\nChanges in interpretation or application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and various other regulatory or accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or our application of, these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Additionally, as we are required to adopt new accounting standards, our methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period. For example, upon adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), we now recognize revenue upon transfer of control, which is generally at time of delivery. Under the previous accounting guidance, we recognized revenue upon acceptance when and if we had production responsibilities. If circumstances change over time or interpretation of the revenue recognition rules change, we could be required to adjust the timing of recognizing revenue and our financial results could suffer.\nWe base our estimates or judgments relating to critical accounting policies on assumptions that can change or prove to be incorrect.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on such statements. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements, including those related to (i) revenue recognition, including uncertainties related to variable consideration and milestones; (ii) stock-based compensation; (iii) allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable; (iv) inventory reserves and obsolescence; (v) customer sales returns and allowances; (vi) contingencies; and (vii) income taxes, (viii) goodwill and intangibles, (ix) business acquisition, and (x) research and development costs.\nFor example, for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, our cost of product sales included the cost of COVID-19 systems that were produced and shipped outside the U.S., but for which revenue was not recognized in the quarter. We decided we were unable to recognize the revenue from those shipments in the second quarter due to the GAAP requirement that we have a high degree of confidence that it is probable that a significant reversal in revenue will not occur in the future. Many factors can affect such a decision, including, for example, actions of third parties and other considerations that are outside our influence or control. As a result, we recognized negative gross margin in the quarter.\nOur estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, as set forth in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these and other estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions. If our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the price of our Common Stock may decline.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret laws and agreements with our key employees and other third parties to protect our proprietary rights, and we cannot be sure that these laws or agreements will adequately protect our rights.\nOur industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection, as well as other intellectual property rights, for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio or obtain licenses to patents and technologies, both in the United States and in other countries. If we cannot continue to develop, obtain and protect intellectual property rights, our revenues and gross profits could be adversely affected. Moreover, our current and future licenses or other rights to patents and other technologies may not be adequate for the operation of our business.\nAs appropriate, we intend to file patent applications and obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology. These patent applications and patents will cover, as applicable, compositions of matter for our products, methods of making those products, methods of using those products and apparatuses relating to the use or manufacture of those products. However, there have been changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may impact our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in 2011, the U.S. enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, including changes that would transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nWe believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, strategic relationships, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and name recognition are essential to our success. All our management personnel are bound by non-disclosure agreements. If personnel leave our employment, in some cases we would be required to protect our intellectual property rights pursuant to common law theories which may be less protective than provisions of employment, non-competition or non-disclosure agreements.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary products under trade secret and copyright laws, enter into license agreements for various materials and methods employed in our products, and enter into strategic relationships for distribution of the products. These strategies afford only limited protection. We currently have some foreign patents issued, and we are seeking additional patent protection in several other foreign jurisdictions for our DPP and optical technology. We have licenses to reagents (antigens and peptides) used in several of our products and products under development. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary assets, and respect the intellectual property rights of others, we participate in several markets where intellectual property rights protections are of little or no value. This can place our products and our company at a competitive disadvantage.\nMoreover, issued patents remain in effect for a fixed period and after expiration will not provide protection of the inventions they cover. Once our patents expire, we may be faced with increased competition, which could reduce our revenues. We may also not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know-how.\nTo facilitate development and commercialization of a proprietary technology base, we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties. Obtaining and maintaining these licenses, which may not be available, may require the payment of up-front fees and royalties. In addition, if we are unable to obtain these types of licenses, our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed or precluded.\nAny future intellectual property disputes could require significant resource and limit or eliminate our ability to sell products or use certain technologies.\nWe may be required to expend substantial resources in asserting or protecting our intellectual property rights, or in defending suits related to intellectual property rights. We may seek to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights through litigation. Such litigation is prevalent and is expected to continue. In our business, there are a large number of patents and patent applications similar to our products, and additional patents may be issued to third parties relating to our product areas. We, our customers or our suppliers may be sued for infringement of patents or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights with respect to one or more of our products. We may also have disputes with parties that license patents to us if we believe the license is no longer needed for our products or the licensed patents are no longer valid or enforceable.\nThere are a large number of patents in our industry, and the claims of these patents appear to overlap in many cases. Therefore there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the extent of patent protection and infringement. Companies may have pending patent applications, which are typically confidential for the first eighteen months following filing that cover technologies we incorporate in our products. Accordingly, we may be subjected to substantial damages for past infringement or be required to modify our products or stop selling them if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. In addition, governmental agencies could commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees or us relating to claims of misuse or misappropriation of another party\u2019s proprietary rights.\nIf we are involved in litigation or other legal proceedings with respect to patents or other intellectual property and proprietary technology, it could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, market share and business because (1) it could consume a substantial portion of managerial and financial resources; (2) its outcome would be uncertain and a court may find that our patents are invalid or unenforceable in response to claims by another party or that the third-party patent claims are valid and infringed by our products; (3) the pendency of any litigation may in and of itself cause our distributors and customers to reduce or terminate purchases of our products; (4) a court could award a preliminary and/or permanent injunction, which would prevent us from selling our current or future products; and (5) an adverse outcome could subject us to the loss of the protection of our patents or to liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, reimbursement of litigation costs and legal fees, special and punitive damages, or future royalty payments, any of which could significantly affect our future earnings.\nUnder certain contracts with third parties, we may indemnify the other party if our products or activities have actually or allegedly infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another party\u2019s proprietary rights. Furthermore, our products may contain technology provided to us by third parties, and we may be unable to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. These other parties may also not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that an infringement or misappropriation claim is asserted against us.\nThere may also be other types of disputes that we become involved in regarding intellectual property rights, including state, federal or foreign court litigation, and patent interference, patent reissue, patent reexamination, or trademark opposition proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Opposition or revocation proceedings could be instituted in a foreign patent office as well. These proceedings permit certain persons to challenge the validity of a patent on the grounds that it was known from the prior art. The filing of such proceedings, or the issuance of an adverse decision in such proceedings, could result in the loss of valuable patent rights that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Third Party Collaborators\nOur use of third-party suppliers, some of which may constitute our sole supply source, for certain important product components and materials presents risks that could have negative consequences for our business.\nWe purchase certain HIV antigens, a syphilis antigen, COVID-19 antigens, the nitrocellulose, and certain other critical components used in our STAT-PAK, STAT-VIEW, SURE CHECK and DPP product lines from a sole or limited number of sources. If for any reason these suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply our antigen, nitrocellulose, or other critical component needs, we believe that alternative supplies could be obtained at a competitive cost. However, a change in any of the antigens, nitrocellulose or other critical components used in our products would require additional development work and approval by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. In addition, it may be difficult to find such an alternate supply source in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. As a result, the termination or limitation of our relationship with one or more of these suppliers could require significant time to complete, increase our costs, and disrupt or discontinue our ability to manufacture and sell the affected products. In addition, governmental purchasers or funding programs in a particular country may require that we purchase key components from suppliers in that country, which could significantly limit our ability to obtain the components with the quality, and at the price, we seek.\nWith some of these suppliers, we do not have long-term agreements and instead purchase components and materials through a purchase order process. As a result, these suppliers may stop supplying us components and materials, limit the allocation of supply and equipment to us due to increased industry demand, or significantly increase their prices at any time with little or no advance notice. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could also result in delivery problems, reduced control over product pricing and quality, and our inability to identify and qualify another supplier in a timely manner.\nMoreover, some of these suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could prevent them from supplying us with components or subassemblies used in the design and manufacture of our products. In addition, these suppliers may experience manufacturing delays or shut downs due to circumstances beyond their control, such as complications related to COVID-19, labor issues, political unrest or natural disasters.\nAny supply chain deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations. The availability of critical components and materials from sole- or limited source suppliers could reduce our control over pricing, quality and timely delivery, increase our costs, could disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell, and preclude us from manufacturing and selling, certain of our products into one or more markets. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and business.\nWe may work with strategic collaborators to assist in developing and commercializing our products, which could limit rights we receive from the collaborations and exposes us to other risks outside our control.\nSome business opportunities that require a technology controlled by a third party, a significant level of investment for development and commercialization or a distribution network beyond our existing sales force may necessitate involving one or more strategic collaborators. As part of our strategy for development and commercialization of our products, we may enter into arrangements with distributors or other third-parties. Relying on such collaborative relationships could be risky to our business for a number of reasons, including: (i) we may be required to transfer material rights to such strategic collaborators, licensees and others; (ii) our collaborators may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (iii) our collaborators may decide to terminate our collaborative arrangement or become insolvent; (iv) our collaborators may develop technologies or components competitive with our products; (v) disagreements with collaborators could result in the termination of the relationship or litigation; and (vi) we may not be able to agree to future collaborative arrangements, or renewals of existing collaborative agreements, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe expect our collaborators will have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities under our agreements, there is no assurance that they will do so. Due to our reliance on strategic agreements, it can make it difficult to accurately forecast our future revenues and operating results.\nOur ability to grow our business will be limited if we fail to maintain existing distribution channels or develop new distribution channels.\nWe collaborate with laboratories, diagnostic companies and distributors in order to sell our products. The sale of our products depends in large part on our ability to sell products to these customers and on the marketing and distribution abilities of the companies with which we collaborate and work with.\nBy relying on distributors or third-parties to market and sell our products could negatively impact our business for various reasons, including: (i) we may not be able to find suitable distributors for our products on satisfactory terms, or at all; (ii) agreements with distributors may prematurely terminate or may result in litigation between the parties; (iii) our distributors or other customers may not fulfill their contractual obligations and distribute our products in the manner or at the levels we expect; (iv) our distributors may prioritize their own private label products that compete with our products; (v) Our existing distributor relationships or contracts may preclude or limit us from entering into arrangements with other distributors; and (vi) we may not be able to negotiate new or renew existing distribution agreements on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe will try to maintain and expand our business with distributors and customers and make every effort to require that they fulfill their contractual obligations, but there can be no assurance that such companies will do so or that new distribution channels will be available on satisfactory terms. If we are unable to do so, our business will be negatively impacted.\nOur U.S. Government contracts require compliance with numerous laws and increases our risk and liability.\nWe are currently receiving funding from the U.S. government related to DPP Zika, and our growth strategy targets sales to U.S. government entities. As a result of our U.S. government funding and potential product sales to the U.S. government, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. U.S. government contracts typically contain a number of extraordinary provisions that would not typically be found in commercial contracts and which may create a disadvantage and additional risks to us as compared to competitors that do not rely on government contracts. As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to increased risks of investigation, criminal prosecution and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not. The results of any such actions could adversely impact our business and have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial performance.\nA violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts, as well as suspension or debarment. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to the facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire enterprise in certain severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with the U.S. government and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow rules relating to billing on cost-plus contracts, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims, among other potential violations. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm and the value of our Common Stock could be negatively affected if allegations of impropriety related to such contracts are made against us.\nOur U.S. government contracts are subject to future funding and the government\u2019s choice to exercise options, and may be terminated at the government\u2019s convenience.\nOur contracts with the U.S. government are subject to future funding and are subject to the right of the government to terminate the contracts in whole or in part for its convenience. There is pressure for the U.S. government to reduce spending. The non-appropriation of funds or the termination for the government\u2019s convenience of our contracts could negatively affect our financial results. If levels of U.S. government expenditures and authorizations for emerging diseases decrease or shift to programs in areas where we do not offer products or are not developing product candidates, or if the U.S. government otherwise declines to exercise its options under its contracts with us, our business, revenues and other operating results would suffer.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nCOVID-19 diagnostic tests, including the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, are subject to changes in CLIA, FDA, ANVISA and other regulatory requirements.\nOur COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems are subject to regulations of the FDA, International Organization for Standards and other regulatory requirements, including ANVISA, Brazil\u2019s health regulatory agency. The regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems may be unclear and are subject to change. Newly promulgated regulations could require changes to COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, necessitate additional procedures, or make it impractical or impossible for us to market COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all. The FDA and other regulatory authorities also have the ability to impose new or additional requirements relating to the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems. The implementation of such changes or new or additional requirements may result in a substantial additional costs and could delay or make it more difficult or complicated to sell our products.\nOn February 4, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a declaration that the threat to public health posed by COVID-19 justify the emergency use of unapproved in vitro diagnostics for the detection or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Under Section 564 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued this declaration, the Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is authorized to issue EUAs to permit certain developers of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to begin offering the tests for detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 without having completed the normally applicable FDA review and clearance or approval process for marketing authorization. We received an EUA for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System on April 14, 2020, which was subsequent revoked by the FDA on June 16, 2020. Such revocation precludes the sale of DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG Systems in the United States unless and until a further regulatory approval or authorization is obtained. We have not received a subsequent EUA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, and we do not currently have an application pending for any such EUA. Moreover, market and regulatory requirements continue to change at a rapid pace. The FDA has announced, for example, that it intends to update its EUA templates with additional considerations related to the impact of genetic variants on test performance as the FDA learns more about the COVID-19 disease and its knowledge in this area progresses. The time required to obtain marketing authorizations and other approvals from regulatory authorities is unpredictable. The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when evaluating clinical trial data can change, and does often change, during development, which makes it difficult to predict with any certainty how they will be applied. If we make future submissions to the FDA, we may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, including future legislation or administrative action, or changes in FDA policy during the period of FDA regulatory review. There can be no assurance that, if we are to make a submission of any future EUA application, we will be successful in obtaining an EUA that would permit us to offer and sell any COVID-19 Diagnostic Test System in the United States.\nWe are subject to governmental export controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nThe United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the export of certain products and technologies. We must export our products in compliance with export controls in the United States, including the Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. We may not always be successful in obtaining necessary export licenses, and our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or limitations on our ability to export or sell our products imposed by these laws may harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue. Noncompliance with these laws could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nIf the United States government imposes restrictions on the export of COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, or any of our other products, such restrictions could have a material impact on our ability to sell our products to existing or potential customers outside of the United States and harm our ability to compete internationally. Any change in export regulations or legislation, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by export regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products outside the United States or to existing or potential customers with international operations. Changes in our ability to sell our products outside the United States could negatively impact our business prospects and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause we may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of our products, we may not generate revenues in the amounts we expect, or in the amounts necessary to continue our business. Our existing products as well as our manufacturing facility must meet quality standards and are subject to inspection by a number of domestic regulatory and other governmental and non-governmental agencies.\nAll of our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products. The process of obtaining required approvals or clearances varies according to the nature of, and uses for, a specific product. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human or animal clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time-consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for that product. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product has been approved in another country.\nThe time taken to obtain approval or clearance varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. As an example, the time required to obtain an EUA from the FDA for COVID-19 tests has lengthened markedly over the past months due to, among other things, application volume. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products, and we may determine to devote our resources to different products.\nChanges or developments in government regulations, policies or interpretations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all. For example, on June 16, 2020, the FDA revoked the EUA it had granted for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System based in part on performance criteria identified after the EUA was granted on April 14, 2020. We do not currently have an EUA from the FDA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, and we do not currently have an application pending for any such EUA Moreover, FDA regulations, policies and procedures with respect to COVID-19 tests may be significantly impacted by the continued development of vaccines for COVID-19 and changes in the FDA\u2019s prioritization guidance.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business. We are, for example, expending resources to modify the design of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test System to achieve performance targets consistent with the FDA\u2019s performance criteria issued subsequent to the granting of our original EUA.\nWe can manufacture and sell our products only if we comply with regulations and quality standards established by government agencies such as the FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture as well as by non-governmental organizations such as the ISO and WHO. We have implemented a quality control system that is intended to comply with applicable regulations. Although FDA approval is not required for the export of our products, there are export regulations promulgated by the FDA that specifically relate to the export of our products that require compliance with FDA QSRs and that also require meeting certain documentary requirements regarding the approval of the product in export markets. We also may be subject to import regulations in connection with international sourcing of components and materials incorporated in the manufacturing of our products.\nIf we do not comply with FDA or other regulatory requirements, we may be required to suspend production or sale of our products or institute a recall, which could result in higher costs and a loss of revenues.\nRegulations of the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies have significant effects on many aspects of our operations, and the operations of our suppliers and distributors, including packaging, labeling, manufacturing, adverse event reporting, recalls, distribution, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other agencies to determine compliance with QSRs and FDA regulatory requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, including but not limited to ISO standards. We believe that our facilities and procedures are in material compliance with the FDA requirements and ISO standards, but the regulations may be unclear and are subject to change, and we cannot be sure that the FDA or other regulators will agree with our compliance with these requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved or cleared products or impose conditions on any product clearances or approvals that could restrict the distribution or commercial applications of those products. Regulatory agencies may impose restrictions on our or our distributors\u2019 advertising and promotional activities or preclude these activities altogether if a noncompliance is believed to exist. In addition, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or additional regulatory actions, including withdrawal of the product from the market.\nOur inability to comply with the applicable requirements of the FDA can result in, among other things, 483 notices, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, recall or seizure of products, civil penalties, withdrawal of product registrations, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant premarket clearance for devices, a determination that a device is not approvable, marketing clearances or approvals, or criminal prosecution. For example, in February 2020, we received a \u201cnot approvable\u201d letter from the FDA with respect to our premarket approval submission on our DPP HIV-Syphilis multiplex test for commercial use in the United States and in June 2020 we received notice from the FDA that the EUA for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System had been revoked. The ability of our suppliers to supply critical components or materials and of our distributors to sell our products could also be adversely affected if their operations are determined to be out of compliance. Such actions by the FDA and other regulatory bodies could adversely affect our revenues, costs and results of operations.\nWe must frequently make judgment decisions with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators subsequently disagree with how we have sought to comply with these regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as product recall, seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products. Our reputation could be substantially impaired if we are assessed any civil and criminal penalties and limit our ability to manufacture and market our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur inability to respond to changes in regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our existing products and procedures are in material compliance with all applicable FDA regulations, ISO requirements, and other applicable regulatory requirements, but the regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products, the QSR and ISO requirements, and other requirements may be unclear and are subject to change. Newly promulgated regulations could require changes to our products, necessitate additional clinical trials or procedures, or make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all. The FDA and other regulatory authorities also have the ability to change the requirements for obtaining product approval and/or impose new or additional requirements as part of the approval process. These changes or new or additional requirements may occur after the completion of substantial clinical work and other costly development activities. The implementation of such changes or new or additional requirements may result in additional clinical trials and substantial additional costs and could delay or make it more difficult or complicated to obtain approvals and sell our products. In addition, the FDA may revoke an Emergency Use Authorization under which our products are sold, where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization. Such revocation would preclude the sale of our affected products unless and until a further regulatory approval or authorization is obtained. For example, For example, on June 16, 2020, the FDA revoked the EUA it had granted for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System based in part on performance criteria identified after the Emergency Use Authorization was granted on April 14, 2020, and since that time we expended resources to design the new COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, including the DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel. We do not currently have an EUA from the FDA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, and we do not currently have an application pending for any such EUA We cannot anticipate or predict the effect, if any, that these types of changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDemand for our products may be affected by FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests and genetic testing.\nRegulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories is covered by the FDA, including our Micro Reader analyzer. The FDA has previously taken the position that it has regulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, but has exercised enforcement discretion by not regulating most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. LDTs are tests designed, developed, and performed in-house by a laboratory. These laboratories are subject to CLIA regulation but such laboratories have previously not been subject to regulation by the FDA under the agency\u2019s medical device requirements.\nHowever, the FDA has announced that it would begin regulating LDTs, and in October 2014 the FDA issued proposed guidance on the regulation of LDTs for public comment. But, on November 18, 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize the proposed guidance prior to the end of the Obama administration. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper synthesizing public comments on the 2014 draft guidance documents and outlining a possible approach to regulation of LDTs. The discussion paper has no legal status and does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents. We cannot predict what policies the Trump administration will adopt with respect to LDTs. If the FDA increases regulation of LDTs, it could make it more difficult for laboratories and other customers to continue offering LDTs that involve genetic or molecular testing. This, in turn, could reduce demand for our products and adversely impact our revenues.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, cleared, approved, authorized, or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and clear, approve, or authorize new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA\u2019s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for medical devices or modifications to be cleared or approved, medical devices to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products, and subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to FDA requirements, we are subject to several government regulations, compliance with which could increase our costs and affect our operations.\nIn addition to the FDA regulations previously described, laws and regulations in some states may restrict our ability to sell products in those states.\nWe must comply with numerous laws related to safe working conditions, environmental protection, disposal of hazardous substances, fire hazard control, manufacturing practices and labor or employment practices. Compliance with these laws or any new or changed laws regulating our business could result in substantial costs. Due to the number of laws and regulations governing our industry, and the actions of a number of government agencies that could affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of these laws and regulations. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with complying with these laws and requirements are substantial or it is determined that we do not comply, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOngoing changes in healthcare regulation could negatively affect our revenues, business and financial condition.\nThere have been several proposed changes in the United States at the federal and state level for comprehensive reforms regarding the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services. These proposals have ranged from fundamentally changing federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under government-funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs. One example is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care or the Affordable Care Act, the Federal healthcare reform law enacted in 2010.\nHealthcare reform initiatives will continue to be proposed, and may reduce healthcare related funding in an effort. It is impossible to predict the ultimate content and timing of any healthcare reform legislation and its resulting impact on us. If significant reforms are made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, those reforms may increase our costs or otherwise negatively effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn April 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the European Union Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the European Economic Area, which we refer to as the EEA, member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The Medical Devices Regulation will, however, only become fully applicable three years after publication (in May 2020). Once applicable, the Medical Devices Regulation will, among other things:\n\u25cf strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u25cf establish explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u25cf improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u25cf set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and\n\u25cf strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nOnce applicable, the Medical Devices Regulation may impose increased compliance obligations for us to access the EU market.\nWe may incur additional costs if we do not comply with privacy, security and breach notification regulations.\nWe believe that we are not a covered entity nor a business associate of a covered entity and are not responsible for complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. Even though we likely are not a covered entity under HIPAA, we do have in place administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the privacy and security of consumers\u2019 personal information. We are required to comply with varying state privacy, security and breach reporting laws. If we fail to comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to properly transferring data containing consumers\u2019 personal information, we could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. Also, there are other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of consumers\u2019 personal information, and we may be subject to enforcement by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. We could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of consumers\u2019 personal information.\nFailure to comply with recent European data protection requirements could increase our costs.\nThe EU has adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the prior national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation called the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018. The new EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and \u20ac20 million and includes new rights such as the \u201cportability\u201d of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, as had been the case under the prior data protection regime, local data protection authorities will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are evaluating these new requirements and implementing a plan to ensure compliance. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, we have no assurances that violations will not occur, particularly given the complexity of the GDPR, as well as the uncertainties that accompany new, comprehensive legislation.\nIf we are not able to manufacture products in accordance with applicable requirements, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur products must meet detailed specifications, performance standards and quality requirements. As a result, our products and the materials used in their manufacture or assembly undergo regular inspections and quality testing. Factors such as defective materials or processes, mechanical failures, human errors, environmental conditions, changes in materials or production methods, and other events or conditions could cause our products or the materials used to produce or assemble our products to fail inspections and quality testing or otherwise not perform in accordance with our label claims or the expectations of our customers.\nIf we are not able to meet the applicable specifications, performance standards, quality requirements or customer expectations could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products or comply with regulatory requirements. These events could, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere are various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry to which we are subject, including anti-kickback laws, laws constraining the sales, false claims laws, marketing and promotion of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements that manufacturers of these products may enter into with physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. There are other laws we are subject to that require us to report certain transactions between it and healthcare professionals. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Many of the existing requirements are new and have not been definitively interpreted by state authorities or courts, and available guidance is limited. We could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, unless and until we are in full compliance with these laws, all of which could materially harm us. Furthermore, changes in or evolving interpretations of these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to change our business practices or subject our business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur compliance with regulations governing public companies is complex and expensive.\nPublic companies are subject to various laws and regulations, which have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. For example, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market. The implementation of certain aspects of these laws and regulations has required and will continue to require substantial management time and oversight and may require us to incur significant additional accounting and legal costs. We continually review changes with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs, and the timing of such costs, we may incur. There are several interpretations of these laws and regulations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, but if we fail to comply with any of these requirements, legal proceedings may be initiated against us, which may adversely affect our business.\nIf we expand our international presence, it may increase our risks and expose our business to regulatory, cultural or other challenges.\nWe will continue to try to increase revenue derived from international sales of our products. There are several of factors that could adversely affect the performance of our business and/or cause us to incur substantially increased costs because of our international presence and sales, including: (i) uncertainty in the application of foreign laws and the interpretation of contracts with foreign parties; (ii) cultural and political differences that favor local competitors or make it difficult to effectively market, sell and gain acceptance of our products; (iii) exchange rates, currency fluctuations, tariffs and other barriers, extended payment terms and dependence on international distributors or representatives; (iv) trade protection measures, trade sanctions and import/export licensing requirements; (v) our inability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or registrations for our products; (vi) Economic conditions, political instability, the absence of available funding sources, terrorism, civil unrest, war and natural disasters in foreign countries; (vii) Reduced protection for, or enforcement of, our patents and other intellectual property rights in foreign countries; (viii) our inability to identify international distributors and negotiate acceptable terms for distribution agreements; and (ix) restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations.\nEconomic, cultural and political conditions and foreign regulatory requirements may slow or prevent the manufacture of our products in countries other than the United States. Interruption of the supply of our products could reduce revenues or cause us to incur significant additional expenses in finding an alternative source of supply. Foreign currency fluctuations and economic conditions in foreign countries could also increase the costs of manufacturing our products in foreign countries.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Common Stock\nOur Common Stock has limited liquidity, and investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing market prices or at all.\nThe liquidity of our Common Stock depends on several factors, including but not limited to our financial results and overall market conditions, so it is not possible to predict whether this level of liquidity will continue, be sustained, or decrease. Decreased trading volume in our stock would make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Our management and larger stockholders exercise significant control over our company.\nThe price of our Common Stock could continue to be volatile.\nThe price of our Common Stock has been volatile, subject to rapid and substantial decreases in stock price, and may be volatile in the future. By way of example, on February 10, 2021, the price of our Common Stock closed at $7.92 per share while on February 17, 2021, our stock price closed at $6.94 per share with no discernable announcements or developments by us or third parties. On February 12, 2021, the intra-day sales price of our Common Stock fluctuated between a reported low sale price of $6.96 and a reported high sales price of $7.45. The following factors, among others, could have a significant impact on the market for our Common Stock: (1) the performance of our business; (2) clinical results with respect to our products or those of our competitors; (3) the gain or loss of significant contracts and availability of funding for the purchase of our products; (4) actions undertaken by the Congress or the Presidential Administration; (5) changes in our relations with our key customers, distributors or suppliers; (6) developments in patent or other proprietary rights; (7) litigation or threatened litigation; (8) general market and economic conditions; (9) the relatively low trading volume for our Common Stock; (10) changes in competition; (11) complaints or concerns about the performance or safety of our products and publicity about those issues, including publicity expressed through social media or otherwise over the internet; (12) failure to achieve, or changes in, financial estimates by securities analysts and comments or opinions about us by securities analysts or major stockholders; (13) announcement of regulatory or enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies against us, our products or our customers; (14) changes in our operating results; (15) terrorist attacks, civil unrest, war and national disasters; and (16) other factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nOverall, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our Common Stock, as well as the stock of many other similar companies. Such price fluctuations are generally unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected.\nAfter the volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s stock, class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject to this type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and the attention and resources of our management could be diverted, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur Common Stock may become the target of a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\nIn the past several weeks prior to the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, securities of certain companies have increasingly experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d Short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Sharp rises in a company\u2019s stock price may force traders in a short position to buy the stock to avoid even greater losses. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. There can be no assurance that we will not, in the future be, a target of a short squeeze, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nAny future issuances of shares of our Common Stock by us could harm the price of our Common Stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings.\nAny future sales of a substantial number of our shares of Common Stock or other equity-related securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities.\nSales of our Common Stock by existing stockholders, executive officers or directors could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nIf our existing stockholders, officers or directors sell our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, it could negatively affect the price of our Common Stock. We are unable to estimate the number of shares of our Common Stock that may actually be resold in the public market since this will depend on the market price for our Common Stock, the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors.\nInstitutional stockholders own significant amounts of our Common Stock. If one or more of these stockholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, the prevailing price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that one or more of our executive officers or non-employee members of our Board of Directors could sell shares of our Common Stock during an open trading window. These transactions and the perceived reasons for these transactions could have a negative effect on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock and currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Therefore, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend entirely upon any future increase in value of our Common Stock. There is no guarantee that our Common Stock will gain value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not generate the expected benefits of future acquisitions or investments, and they could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management, increase our expenses and negatively affect our business.\nAs a way for us to grow our business, we may pursue strategic acquisitions or investments. These activities, and their impact on our business, are subject to many risks, including the following: (i) the benefits expected to be derived from an acquisition or investment may not materialize and could be affected by numerous factors, such as regulatory developments, insurance reimbursement, our inexperience with new businesses or markets, general economic conditions and increased competition; (ii) we may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s personnel, assets, management, information technology systems, accounting policies and practices, products and/or technology into our business; (iii) we may not be able to accurately forecast the performance or ultimate impact of an acquired business; and (iv) an acquisition may result in the incurrence of unexpected expenses, stockholder lawsuits, the dilution of our earnings or our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or potential losses from undiscovered liabilities not covered by an indemnification from the seller(s) of the acquired business.\nIf these factors occur, we may be unable to achieve all or a significant part of the benefits expected from an acquisition or investment. This may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow our business or otherwise achieve our financial and strategic objectives.\nDevelopments related to the U.K.\u2019s referendum on membership in the E.U. could adversely affect us.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or E.U. On January 24, 2020, the U.K. and the E.U. entered into a withdrawal agreement pursuant to which the U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020,In December 2020, the U.K. and E.U. agreed on a trade and cooperation that will provisionally apply after the end of the transition period until it is ratified by the parties to the agreement. On December 31, 2020, the U.K. passed legislation giving effect to the trade and cooperation agreement. The E.U. is expected to formally adopt the agreement in early 2021. The trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the U.K. and the E.U., including as it relates to trade, transport, visas, judicial, law enforcement and security matters. Notably, under the trade and cooperation agreement, U.K. goods no longer benefit from the free movement of goods, and there is no longer the free movement of people between the U.K. and the E.U.\nSuch a withdrawal from the E.U. is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the changes to U.K.\u2019s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services and labor within the E.U., or the European single market, and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our U.K. operations. We may also face new regulatory costs and challenges that could have an adverse effect on our operations and development programs. For example, because the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical studies, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from E.U. directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the U.K. and/or E.U. for our product or gene therapy product candidate, which could significantly harm our business.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the E.U. will have and how such withdrawal may affect us.\nLegislative and other regulatory changes could have an effect on our business.\nChanges in regulatory or economic conditions or in the laws and policies governing foreign trade, taxes, manufacturing, and development in the United States could impact our business. Economic and regulatory changes could also affect foreign currency exchange rates which, in turn, could affect our reported financial results and our competitiveness on a worldwide basis.\nOur business may be negatively affected by terrorist attacks or natural disasters.\nTerrorist attacks or natural disasters could cause economic instability. These events could negatively affect economic conditions both within and outside the United States and harm demand for our products. The operations of our customers and suppliers could be negatively impacted and eliminate, reduce or delay our customers\u2019 ability to purchase and use our products and our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide raw materials and finished products.\nOur facilities, including some pieces of manufacturing equipment and our computer systems, may be difficult to replace. Various types of disasters, including fires, earthquakes, floods and acts of terrorism, may affect our facilities and computer systems. In the event our existing facilities or computer systems are affected by man-made or natural disasters, we may have difficulty operating our business and may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or shut down entirely, it would seriously harm our business.", "PERMNO": 13453, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CEMI"}
