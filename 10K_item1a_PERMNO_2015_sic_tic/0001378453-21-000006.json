Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The following is a summary of the principal risk factors described in this section:\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly, adversely impacted aspects of our business and may have a material adverse impact on us;\n\u2022A majority of our revenue comes from fuel sales, which generate low gross margins;\n\u2022Technological advances, including those that increase fuel efficiency and the use of alternative fuels, may lead customers to purchase less fuel and visit our travel centers less frequently;\n\u2022Increased fuel prices, fuel price volatility or an interruption in our fuel supply may adversely affect our results;\n\u2022There is limited competition among fuel card providers, which may adversely affect our ability to negotiate fees and increase prices to offset expenses;\n\u2022Our financial results are dependent on the demand for trucking services in the United States, which may decline if the U.S economy declines;\n\u2022A large percentage of our revenue is concentrated in a few large customers;\n\u2022Additional environmental regulations and market reaction to climate change concerns may decrease the demand for diesel fuel, and our compliance with such regulations and attempts to respond to those concerns may be expensive;\n\u2022We have substantial indebtedness and fixed rent obligations;\n\u2022We may be subject to increases in our interest rates, as well as adverse changes in fiscal policies and credit conditions;\n\u2022Any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of our information technology could harm our business;\n\u2022Compliance with data privacy and security laws may be expensive;\n\u2022Our labor costs cannot easily be reduced and the passage of minimum wage laws, health insurance requirements or similar legislation will likely cause costs to rise;\n\u2022Our insurance may not adequately cover our potential losses;\n\u2022Changing market conditions, practices and U.S. trade policies may negatively affect our business;\n\u2022We may not be able to execute or fund our business and growth strategies;\n\u2022Acquisitions or development projects may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than anticipated and the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and projects may not be realized;\n\u2022Provisions in our charter, bylaws, material agreements, licenses, and permits may prevent or delay a change in our control; and\n\u2022Our stock has experienced significant price and trading volume volatility and may continue to do so.\nOur business faces many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the market prices of our equity or debt securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should carefully consider the following risks, the risks referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report and the information contained under the heading \"Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly, adversely impacted aspects of our business and it may ultimately have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the global economy, including the U.S. economy, and has resulted in a global economic recession.\nA variety of factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, a decline in travel and demand for diesel fuel and gasoline, including but not limited to (i) restrictions on travel and public gatherings imposed by governmental entities and employers; (ii) a decline in the demand for products as a result of certain stay in place practices and reduced hours of operation for businesses, including restaurants and other retail stores; (iii) widespread work from home arrangements; (iv) closed or reduced factory operations; (v) the postponement or cancellation of industry conventions and conferences, music and arts festivals, sporting events and other large public gatherings and (vi) negative public perceptions of travel and public gatherings in light of the perceived risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThus far, we have experienced increased diesel fuel sales volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic because of increased demand for e-commerce, which has resulted in increased truck freight delivery. Further, being recognized as a provider of services essential to businesses by various government entities has allowed us to keep our travel centers open for business during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, if the current economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic continue or worsen, or if they fail to sufficiently and sustainably improve after the pandemic ends, demand for truck freight delivery may decline and we may experience declines in our diesel fuel sales volumes. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we closed most of our FSRs and furloughed staff starting in March 2020. We have since reopened many of those FSRs; however, additional restrictions imposed by various governmental entities in response to recent increases in COVID-19 infections have curtailed our restaurant operations, and in some cases, has resulted in our closing certain of our restaurants. Additionally, we have incurred additional costs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including for enhancing cleaning and sanitizing, personal protective equipment for staff and increased compensation for certain staff during the pandemic.\nWe cannot accurately predict the extent and duration of the pandemic or the severity and duration of its economic impact. Potential consequences of the unprecedented measures taken in response to the spread of COVID-19, and current market disruptions and volatility affecting us, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022declines in the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022our inability to comply with financial covenants that could result in our defaulting under certain of our debt agreements;\n\u2022our failure to pay interest and principal when due under our outstanding debt, which may result in the acceleration of payment for our outstanding debt and our possible loss of our Credit Facility;\n\u2022our inability to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all;\n\u2022increased risk of our and our customers' and suppliers' inability to weather an extended cessation of normal economic activity, thereby impairing our or their ability to continue functioning as a going concern and increasing the risk of default or bankruptcy for us or them;\n\u2022our inability to operate our business if the health of our management personnel and other employees is affected, particularly if a significant number of individuals are impacted; and\n\u2022reduced economic demand resulting from mass employee layoffs or furloughs in response to governmental action taken to slow the spread of COVID-19, which could impact our and our customers' and suppliers' continued viability and the demand for our products and services.\nFurther, the extent and strength of any economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic ends is uncertain and subject to various factors and conditions. Recently, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, issued Emergency Use Authorizations for certain COVID-19 vaccines. It is unknown when these vaccines or other therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 will become widely available and administered and if they will be effective. Our business, operations and financial position may continue to be negatively impacted after the COVID-19 pandemic ends and may remain at depressed levels compared to prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and those conditions may continue for an extended period.\nThe actions we have taken, and those we may take, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may not be sufficient to avoid substantial harm to our business.\nWe have taken several actions in an attempt to address the operating and financial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\u2022we reduced our capital expenditures during 2020 to conserve cash and liquidity;\n\u2022we raised $85.4 million of additional equity;\n\u2022we raised $200.0 million of additional debt financing;\n\u2022we rationalized our hours of operation and employment levels, including furloughing many field and corporate employees during parts of 2020;\n\u2022we temporarily closed most of our FSRs, many of which have reopened, although certain FSRs have temporarily re-closed;\n\u2022we have implemented enhanced sanitizing and cleaning procedures at our travel centers in accordance with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance; and\n\u2022we have been actively engaging with government authorities, our customers, suppliers and other vendors to try to best execute our business during the pandemic.\nThere can be no assurance that these actions or others that we may take will be successful or that they will enable us to maintain sufficient liquidity and withstand the current economic challenges. Further, certain actions we have taken may limit our ability to quickly return to operating at levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, if we experience delays in certain actions, such as furloughed employees deciding not to return if and when we request that they do so or we may decide to re-close certain of our FSRs.\nOur operating margins are low.\nOur operating margins are low. Fuel sales comprise the majority of our revenues and generate low gross margin percentages. A small percentage decline in our future revenues or increase in our future costs, especially revenues and costs related to fuel, may cause our profits to decline or us to incur losses. Fuel prices and sourcing have historically been volatile, which may increase the risk of declines in revenues or increases in costs. Shifts in customer demand for our products and services, including as a result of increased fuel conservation practices or use of alternative fuels, or heightened competition could cause our operating margins to narrow further and we may incur losses. Our operating margins will also be negatively impacted by increases in transaction and other fees we are required to pay to fuel card providers if we cannot pass along those increased fees to our customers without adversely affecting demand.\nDisruptive technologies, including those that increase fuel efficiency of motor vehicle engines or change truck freight delivery practices, and the use of other fuel conservation practices and alternative fuels may adversely impact our business.\nThe largest part of our business consists of selling motor fuel. Truck and other vehicle manufacturers and our customers continue to focus on technological innovations to improve motor vehicle fuel efficiency and conserve fuel. The development of new technologies, such as truck platooning, or the electronic linking of trucks with a lead vehicle, heat and kinetic energy recovery technologies, substantially lighter \"super trucks\" and higher efficiency motor fuels could result in significant increases in fuel efficiency. In addition, advances in alternative fuel technologies, such as electric motor vehicle engines that do not require diesel fuel and hybrid electric-diesel/gasoline engines, may lead to their greater adoption by the trucking industry and other motorists. Government regulation may encourage or require the improved fuel efficiency of motor vehicle engines, other fuel conservation practices and alternative fuels. If our customers purchase less motor fuel because their trucks or other vehicles operate more fuel efficiently or use alternative fuels, our financial results may decline and we may incur losses unless we are able to offset the declines by selling substitute or other products or services, gaining market share, increasing our gross margins per gallon of fuel sold or reducing our operating costs. It is unclear whether we will be able to operate our travel centers profitably if the amount of motor fuels used by the U.S. trucking industry or other motorists declines.\nAnother significant part of our business is the sale of nonfuel products and services to drivers who visit our locations, often in connection with purchasing fuel. If customers require fewer stops to refuel due to the technological innovations described above or driverless motor vehicle technologies result in fewer individual drivers on the U.S. interstate highways, our customer traffic and sales of nonfuel products may decline. Such reductions may materially and adversely affect our sales and our business.\nFuel price increases and fuel price volatility could negatively affect our business.\nIncreasing fuel prices and fuel price volatility have several adverse impacts upon our business. First, high fuel prices result in higher truck shipping costs. This causes shippers to consider alternative means for transporting freight, which reduces trucking business and, in turn, reduces our business. Second, high fuel prices cause our trucking customers to seek cost savings throughout their businesses. This has resulted in many of our customers implementing measures to conserve fuel, including purchasing trucks that have more fuel efficient engines, employing alternative fuel or other technologies, lowering maximum driving speeds and employing other practices to conserve fuel, such as truck platooning and reduced truck engine idling, which measures reduce total fuel consumption and in turn reduce our fuel sales volume. Third, higher fuel prices may result in less disposable income for our customers to purchase our nonfuel products and services. Fourth, higher and more volatile fuel commodity prices increase the working capital needed to maintain our fuel inventory and receivables, which increases our costs of doing business. Further, increases in fuel prices may place us at a cost disadvantage to our competitors that may have larger fuel inventory or are able to realize greater fuel volume purchasing discounts or execute forward contracts during periods of lower fuel prices. If fuel commodity prices or fuel price volatility increase, our financial results may worsen.\nDeclines in and volatility of global oil market prices may negatively impact our fuel supplies.\nIn the first half of 2020, the global market prices for oil experienced sharp declines and volatility. Factors that caused such declines and volatility included sharp reductions in demand for, and oversupply of, fuel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global economic slowdown, as well as disagreements among major oil producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. Decreased demand for oil may result in oil producers reducing their production. In addition, if the price of oil becomes too low for a sustained period, major oil refineries in the United States may continue to decrease their operations and capacities. If this were to occur, there may arise a shortage of, or longer lead time for us to obtain, fuel supplies. We typically maintain only up to a few days of fuel inventory at our travel centers. As a result, we could face fuel supply shortages. In addition, if oil production and refinery capacity are reduced, that may lead to increases in fuel prices. Increases in fuel prices may reduce our fuel margins and require us to fund increased amounts of working capital, which would adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nAn interruption in our fuel supplies would materially adversely affect our business.\nTo mitigate the risks arising from fuel price volatility, we generally maintain limited fuel inventory. Accordingly, an interruption in our fuel supplies would materially adversely affect our business. Interruptions in fuel supplies may be caused by local conditions, such as a malfunction in a particular pipeline or terminal, by weather related events, such as hurricanes in the areas where petroleum or natural gas is extracted or refined, or by national or international conditions, such as government rationing, strategic decisions by major oil producing nations and cartels, acts of terrorism or wars. Further, our fuel suppliers may fail to provide us with fuel due to these or other reasons. Any limitation in available fuel supplies or on the fuel we can offer for sale may cause our profits to decline or us to experience losses.\nLimited competition among third party fuel card companies could adversely affect our business.\nLimited competition in the fuel card industry and the increasing dependence of trucking companies on their fuel card providers could adversely affect our business. Most of our trucking customers use fuel cards issued by third party fuel card companies to purchase fuel from us. The fuel card industry has only two significant participants, Comdata and WEX, and we cannot easily substitute an alternative fuel card for trucking companies to use to acquire fuel at our locations. We believe almost all trucking companies use only a single fuel card provider with which they have a direct negotiated contractual relationship and trucking companies have become increasingly dependent upon the data, reports and other services provided by their respective fuel card provider to manage their fleets and simplify their data processing. Any effort to convince trucking companies to use an alternative card at our locations requires significant time, expense and coordination with the provider of that alternative card, and may not be successful. We recently renewed our agreement with Comdata, which is now scheduled to expire on December 4, 2026 and thereafter will renew automatically for one year terms, unless terminated prior to the date of such automatic renewal. In addition, our agreement with WEX is scheduled to expire on November 6, 2021, and thereafter, will renew automatically for successive two year terms, in each case, unless terminated prior to the date of such automatic renewal. Our agreements with Comdata and WEX may be terminated and we may not be able to renew our agreements or enter into new agreements with them. Further, any renewal or new agreement we may enter with either of them may be on terms that are materially less favorable to us than our current agreements with them. If Comdata or WEX increase the fees we are required to pay, we may not be able to recover the increased expense through higher prices to customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial results are affected by U.S. trucking industry economic conditions.\nThe trucking industry is the primary customer for our products and services. Demand for trucking services in the United States generally reflects the amount of commercial activity in the U.S. economy. When the U.S. economy declines, demand for goods moved by trucks usually declines, and in turn demand for our products and services typically declines, which could significantly harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive.\nWe believe that large trucking fleets and long haul trucking fleets tend to purchase the large majority of their fuel from us or our largest competitors at travel centers and truck stops that are located at or near interstate highway exits. Based on the number of locations, Pilot and Love's are our largest competitors. They may have greater financial and other resources than we do, which may facilitate their ability to compete more effectively. Increased competition between the major competitors in the travel center and truck stop business could result in a reduction of our gross margins or an increase in our expenses or capital improvement costs, which could negatively affect our profitability and our liquidity. We believe that, in recent years, both of our principal competitors, Pilot and Love's, added significantly more travel centers to their networks than we added to our network, and in some cases, competition from new sites added by Pilot and Love's have negatively impacted our unit results.\nFurther, the truck repair and maintenance service industry is highly competitive. Such services can be obtained by trucking companies and truck drivers from a variety of sources, including national and regional truck repair and maintenance facilities and roadside assistance fleets, full service travel centers, truck stop chains, fleet maintenance terminals, independent garages, truck and commercial tire dealerships, truck quick lube facilities and other parts and service centers. In addition, some trucking companies operate their own terminals to provide repair and maintenance services to their own trucking fleets and drivers. Pilot and Love's have increased their respective numbers of truck repair and maintenance facilities and their roadside assistance fleets over the past several years and should this trend continue, our competitive position could be weakened. Some of our competitors in the truck repair and maintenance service business may have more resources or lower costs than we do and may have vertically integrated businesses, which may provide them competitive advantages.\nWe also face competition from restaurants in the quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry. These segments are highly competitive and fragmented. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains offering dine-in, carry-out, delivery and catering services. Many of our competitors have existed longer and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Among our competitors are a number of multi unit, multi market, fast casual restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally. These competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, facilities or management, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.\nAny inability to successfully compete effectively will reduce customer traffic and sales at our locations and may prevent us from sustaining or increasing our revenue or improving our profitability.\nWe are dependent upon certain customers for a significant portion of our truck service revenue, and the loss of, or significant reduction in services to, these customers would adversely affect our results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, truck services performed for one customer accounted for 8.2% of our total gross truck service revenue. We expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. The loss of this large customer or a significant reduction in sales to them could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change and other environmental legislation and regulation and market reaction thereto may decrease demand for diesel fuel and require us to make significant changes to our business and to make capital or other expenditures.\nClimate change and other environmental legislation and regulations, including those addressing greenhouse gas emissions, and market reaction to any such legislation or regulation or to climate change concerns, may decrease the demand for our major product, diesel fuel, and may require us to make significant capital or other expenditures. Federal and state governments require manufacturers to limit emissions from trucks and other motor vehicles, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's, or the EPA's, gasoline and diesel sulfur control requirements that limit the concentration of sulfur in motor fuel. Further, legislative and regulatory initiatives requiring increased truck fuel efficiency have accelerated in the United States and these mandates have and may continue to result in decreased demand for diesel fuel. For example, although the prior U.S. Presidential Administration rolled back various rules relating to greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for trucks and other motor vehicles, in August 2016 the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration established final regulations intended to phase in more stringent greenhouse gas emission and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty trucks. The new Administration is expected to more aggressively pursue limits on emissions from trucks and other motor vehicles. In addition, the California Air Resources Board and other similar state government agencies routinely consider rulemaking activity the purpose of which is to improve fuel efficiency and limit pollution from vehicles operating in the applicable state. Regulations that limit carbon emissions may cause our costs at our locations to increase, make some of our locations obsolete or competitively disadvantaged, or require us to make material investments in our properties. Increased costs incurred by our suppliers as a result of climate change or other environmental legislation or regulation may be passed on to us in the prices we pay for our fuel supplies, but we may not be able to pass on those increased costs to our customers without adversely impacting demand. Increased fuel costs resulting from these reasons would likely have similar effects on our business, operations and liquidity as discussed elsewhere regarding high fuel costs, including decreased demand for our fuel at our locations, increased working capital needs and decreased fuel gross margins. Moreover, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, technological changes or changes in customer transportation or fueling preferences, including as a result of or in response to climate change or other environmental legislation or regulation or the market reaction thereto, may require us to make significant changes to our business and to make capital or other expenditures to adopt those technologies or to address those changed preferences and may decrease the demand for products and services sold at our locations.\nOur storage and dispensing of petroleum products, waste and other hazardous substances create the potential for environmental damage, and compliance with environmental laws is often expensive.\nOur business is subject to laws relating to the protection of the environment. The locations we operate include fueling areas, truck repair and maintenance facilities and tanks for the storage and dispensing of petroleum products, waste and other hazardous substances, all of which create the potential for environmental damage. Environmental laws expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to reimburse third parties for damages and costs they incur in connection with environmental hazards or become liable for fines and penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our products or activities in the future; more stringent laws, more vigorous enforcement policies or stricter interpretation of existing laws in the future could cause us to expend significant amounts or experience losses.\nUnder the leases between us and SVC, we generally have agreed to indemnify SVC from environmental liabilities it may incur arising at any of the properties we lease from SVC. Although we maintain insurance policies that cover our environmental liabilities, that coverage may not adequately cover liabilities we may incur. To the extent we incur material amounts for environmental matters for which we do not receive insurance or other third party reimbursement or for which we have not recognized a liability in prior years, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, or we become subject to costs and requirements not similarly experienced by our competitors, our competitive position may be harmed. Also, to the extent we are or become obligated to fund any such liabilities, such funding obligation could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial position.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and rent obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur indebtedness and rent obligations are substantial. The terms of our leases with SVC require us to pay all of our operating costs and generally fixed amounts of rent. During periods of business decline, our revenues and gross margins may decrease but our minimum rents due to SVC and the interest payable on our debt will not nor may certain of our other fixed costs be easily or practically reduced. A decline in our revenues or an increase in our expenses may make it difficult or impossible for us to make payments of interest and principal on our debt or meet our rent obligations and could limit our ability to obtain financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing, lease obligations or other purposes. Our substantial indebtedness and rent obligations may also increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, market and industry conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business operations or to our industry overall, and place us at a disadvantage in relation to competitors that have lower relative debt levels. If we default under our SVC Leases, we may be unable to continue our business. Any or all of the above events and factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely upon trade creditors for a significant amount of our working capital and the availability of alternative sources of financing may be limited.\nOur fuel purchases are our largest operating cost. Historically, we have paid for our fuel purchases after delivery. In the past, as our fuel costs increased with the increase in commodity market prices, some of our fuel suppliers were unwilling to adjust the amounts of our available trade credit to accommodate the increased costs of the fuel volume that we purchased. Also, our historical financial results and general U.S. economic conditions have caused some fuel suppliers to request letters of credit or other forms of security for our purchases. We cannot predict how high or low fuel prices may be in the future, or to what extent our trade creditors will be willing to adjust the amounts of our available trade credit to accommodate increased fuel costs. Fuel commodity prices significantly impact our working capital requirements, and the unavailability of sufficient amounts of trade credit or alternative sources of financing to meet our working capital requirements could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by a material increase in interest rates, including changes that may result from the expected phase out of LIBOR, and adverse changes in fiscal policy or credit market conditions.\nIn the past, the U.S. federal government's fiscal policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates, which impacted business and consumer behavior. In the recent past, interest rates have remained at relatively low levels on a historical basis, and the U.S. Federal Reserve System, or the U.S. Federal Reserve, has indicated that it does not expect to raise interest rates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and current market conditions until at least the end of 2023. There can be no assurance, however, that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not raise rates prior to that time. Increases in the federal funds rate would cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise. Material increases in interest rates or market reactions to those increases, or anticipated increases, may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, LIBOR is expected to be phased out for new contracts by December 31, 2021 and for pre-existing contracts by June 30, 2023. The interest rates under certain of our credit agreements are based on LIBOR and future debt we may incur may also be based on LIBOR. We currently expect that the determination of interest under certain of our credit agreements would be based on the alternative rates provided under those credit agreements or would be revised to provide for an interest rate that approximates the existing interest rate as calculated in accordance with LIBOR. Despite our current expectations, we cannot be certain that, if LIBOR is phased out or transitioned, the changes to the determination of interest under our credit agreements would approximate the current calculation in accordance with LIBOR. An alternative interest rate index that may replace LIBOR may result in our paying increased interest.\nOur credit agreements impose restrictive covenants on us, and a default under the agreements relating to those credit agreements or under our indenture governing our Senior Notes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility agreements require us and our subsidiaries, among other obligations, to maintain specified financial ratios under certain circumstances and to satisfy certain financial tests. In addition, our Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility agreements restrict, among other things, our ability to incur debt and liens, make certain investments and pay dividends and other distributions including, under certain circumstances, payments on our 2028 Senior Notes, our 2029 Senior Notes and our 2030 Senior Notes, which we refer to collectively as our Senior Notes. Under certain circumstances, we are required to seek permission from the lenders under our Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility agreements to engage in specified corporate actions.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants, or similar covenants contained in future financing agreements, could result in a default under our Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility agreements, indenture and other agreements containing cross default provisions, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A default could permit lenders or holders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt and to terminate any commitments to lend. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Senior Notes. In addition, a default under our Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility agreements or indenture would also constitute a default under the SVC Leases due to cross default provisions in the SVC Leases. Further, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. If our indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. In such circumstances, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation and, as a result, investors could lose their investment in our securities.\nOur use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.\nWe are party to joint ventures with unrelated third parties with respect to Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC, or PTP, and QuikQ and we may in the future acquire, develop or recapitalize properties in joint ventures or enter into other types of joint ventures, with other persons or entities. In addition, we may choose to exit any joint venture arrangement we are party to. Our participation in these joint ventures is subject to risks, including the following:\n\u2022we share approval rights over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture;\n\u2022we may be required to contribute additional capital if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions;\n\u2022our joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals;\n\u2022our joint venture partners may be subject to different laws or regulations than us, or may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest;\n\u2022our ability to sell the interest on advantageous terms when we so desire may be limited or restricted under the terms of the applicable joint venture agreements; and\n\u2022disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that could be expensive and distracting to management and could delay important decisions.\nAny of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of information technology could harm our business.\nWe rely on IT systems, including the internet and cloud-based infrastructures, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee and payroll data and workforce scheduling information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, retail sales, credit and other card payments and authorizations, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions, as well as certain franchisee services and functions. We purchase some of the IT systems we use from vendors on whom our IT systems materially depend and we also internally develop some of our IT systems. We rely on commercially available and proprietary IT systems, software, tools and monitoring to maintain and enhance the operational functioning of our IT systems and to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information, such as payment card and credit information. In addition, the IT systems we use for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, may put payment card data at risk, and some of these IT systems are determined and controlled by the payment card suppliers, who may be prone to cyber-attacks, data breaches and payment frauds, and not by us. Although we take various actions to protect and maintain the operational functioning and security of the IT systems we use and the data processed and maintained in them, it is possible that we could have a failure, disruption and loss of data and our operational and security measures will not prevent the improper functioning of or damage to the IT systems we use, or the improper access to such IT systems or disclosure of personally identifiable or confidential information, such as in the event of a cyberattack. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our or our provider's IT systems could cause material interruptions in our operations, damage our reputation, require significant expenditures to determine the severity and scope of the breach, subject us to material liability claims, material claims of banks and payment card companies or regulatory penalties, reduce our customers' willingness to conduct business with us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, banks and payment card companies continue to adopt new technologies to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks, data breaches and fraud and, if we do not adopt these new technologies by the deadlines set by the banks and payment card companies, those companies may not pay us for fraudulent transactions occurring at our locations with those companies' cards or may otherwise penalize us. Further, the failure of the IT systems we use to operate effectively, or problems we may experience with maintaining the IT systems we currently use or transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, could significantly harm our business and operations and cause us to incur significant costs to remediate such problems.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. Compliance with such laws may require us to incur significant costs, and the failure to comply with such laws could result in legal or reputational risk, as well as significant penalties and sanctions.\nA significant amount of our sales are by credit or debit cards. We may experience security breaches in which personal information that we process or maintain, which may include credit and debit card information, is stolen or exposed, and our business operations may be impacted if our systems are not able to process such information due to a cyberattack, ransomware or other system failure. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft or unauthorized disclosure of such information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant expenses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our labor costs cannot be easily reduced without adversely affecting our business.\nTo maintain and manage our operations requires certain minimum staffing levels to operate our travel centers 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, and we attempt to manage our staffing to avoid excess, unused capacity. As a result, it may be difficult for us to affect future reductions in our staff without adversely affecting our business prospects. Further, passage of federal and state legislation, such as minimum wage increases and health insurance requirements, have increased our labor costs and we expect they will continue to do so and may further increase if, for example, legislation is enacted that further increases the minimum wage and health insurance requirements or other costs of our business. Certain aspects of our business require higher skilled personnel, such as truck service technicians. Hiring, training and maintaining higher skilled personnel can be costly, especially if turnover is high. Further, as we grow our business, particularly the aspects of our business that require higher skilled personnel, we have experienced difficulty with staffing those positions with qualified personnel and we may continue to do so. These staffing challenges have resulted in increased costs to attract and attempt to retain staff, particularly high skilled personnel, and we expect these staffing and cost pressures to continue for at least the near term. Also, certain opportunities for sales may be lost if staffing levels are reduced too much or if we are unable to maintain a sufficient number of higher skilled employees. If this growth is stalled, takes longer to achieve or is not realized, our operating results and cash flows will be adversely impacted. In addition, costs for health care and other benefits, due to regulation, market factors or otherwise, may further increase our labor costs.\nIf the Company is unable to attract, motivate and retain experienced and knowledgeable personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to employ and train individuals with the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to execute our business model and achieve our business objectives. The failure of the Company to attract, motivate and retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan could adversely impact our ability to successfully carry out our business strategy and retain other key personnel.\nWe may not realize the benefits we expect from the workforce reduction plan we implemented in 2020.\nIn April 2020, we implemented a workforce reduction, pursuant to which we eliminated approximately 130 positions and repositioned certain of our management staff. We expect to realize approximately $13.1 million of net annual savings as a result, not including the separation costs of approximately $4.3 million contemplated by the plan. Although we believe these actions appropriately position our current work staff and organization, we cannot be certain they will. Our business may be harmed if we eliminated too many positions. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our expected cost savings if we need to adjust to add more staffing or outsourced personnel in response to changed business conditions or otherwise. In addition, we may incur costs in excess of our estimates regarding the plan, including if litigation in connection with the plan arises. As a result, we may not realize the benefits we expect from the workforce reduction plan.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies could reduce the volume of imported goods into the United States, which may materially reduce truck freight volume in the United States and our sales.\nThe prior Administration and the U.S. Congress took certain actions that impacted U.S. trade, including entering into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States, engaging in a \"trade war\" with the People's Republic of China and imposing, or threatening to impose, punitive trade measures on other nations. Changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \"trade wars,\" in increased costs for goods imported into the United States, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with the United States. If these consequences are realized, the volume of economic activity in the United States, including trucking freight volume, may be materially reduced. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect our sales and our business. Further, the realization of these matters may increase our cost of goods and, if those costs cannot be passed on to our customers without adversely affecting demand, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe trucking industry may fail to satisfy market demands for transporting goods or market participants may choose other means to transport goods.\nThe trucking industry has been experiencing a shortage of qualified truck drivers and trucks. Further, increased regulations on the activities of truck drivers and trucking companies, including increased monitoring and enforcement of the number of hours truck drivers may operate a truck each day, and other matters have limited the ability of trucking companies to satisfy market demands for transporting goods. In addition, other means of transporting goods besides by truck are available, and new means of transportation may be developed. For example, there have been general news reports of other means of transportation being increasingly explored, such as light rail, airplanes and drones. If the trucking industry is unable to satisfy market demands for transporting goods or if the use of other means of transporting goods increases, the trucking industry may experience reduced business, which would negatively affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nInsurance may not adequately cover our losses.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for our properties, including for casualty, liability, fire, extended coverage and business interruption loss insurance. We are responsible for obtaining and paying for insurance for the travel center properties that we lease from SVC in accordance with the terms of our SVC Leases. We also require our franchisees to maintain insurance for our travel centers they operate as a franchisee. Recently, the costs of insurance have increased significantly, and these increased costs have had an adverse effect on us. Losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by hurricanes, flooding, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, among other things, or losses from terrorism, may be covered by insurance policies with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that we or a franchisee may not be able to pay. Insurance proceeds may not be adequate to restore an affected property to its condition prior to a loss or to compensate us for our losses, including the loss of future revenues from an affected property. Similarly, our other insurance, including our general liability insurance, may not provide adequate insurance to cover our losses. Further, we cannot be certain that certain types of risks that are currently insurable will continue to be insurable on an economically feasible basis, and, in the future, we may discontinue certain insurance coverage on some or all of our properties that we own or are otherwise not obligated to maintain pursuant to agreements with third parties, if the cost of premiums for any of these policies in our judgment exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the loss. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we may have to incur uninsured costs to mitigate such losses or lose all or a portion of the capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. We might also remain obligated for any financial obligations related to the property, even if the property is irreparably damaged. In addition, future changes in the insurance industry's risk assessment approach and pricing structure could further increase the cost of insuring our properties or decrease the scope of insurance coverage, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nPrivatization of toll roads or of rest areas may negatively affect our business.\nSome states have privatized their toll roads that are part of the interstate highway system. We believe it is likely that tolls will increase on privatized highways. In addition, some states may increase tolls for their own account. If tolls are introduced or increased on highways in the proximity of our locations, our business at those travel centers may decline because truck drivers and motorists may seek alternative routes. Similarly, some states have privatized or are considering privatizing their publicly owned highway rest areas. If publicly owned rest areas along highways are privatized and converted to travel centers in the proximity of some of our locations, our business at those locations may decline and we may experience losses.\nThe prior Administration had agreed to a $2.0 trillion infrastructure plan that contained several policy provisions that would have been detrimental to the truck stop industry and our business. Specifically, the Administration's proposal intended to shift the responsibility for financing infrastructure projects from the federal government to the states and the private sector; such shifting would likely have greatly increased tolling of U.S. highways. The prior Administration also proposed rest area commercialization. While the prior Administration's proposal was not enacted by the U.S. Congress, it is possible the current Administration and U.S. Congress may propose an infrastructure plan or other legislation that could have similar adverse effects on our business.\nUnfavorable publicity could negatively affect our results of operations as well as our future business.\nWe operate our travel centers and standalone restaurants under a small number of brand names. We sell gasoline under brands we do not own at most of our locations, many of our locations have QSRs that operate under brands we do not own and some locations have FSRs that operate under brands we do not own. In addition, we resell numerous other products we obtain from third parties. If we or the companies or brands associated with our products and offerings become associated with negative publicity, including as a result of customer or employee complaints, our customers may avoid purchasing our products and offerings at our locations because of our association with the particular company or brand. The use of social media by our customers, employees or other individuals to make negative statements about our products, offerings, service, brands or other matters associated with us could quickly damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues, and we may not be able to quickly and effectively address or counter the negative publicity. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, the control we may exercise over our franchisees is limited. Negative publicity or reputational damage relating to any of our franchisees may be imputed to our entire company and business. If we were to experience these or other instances of negative publicity or reputational damage, our sales and results of operations may be harmed.\nFood safety and foodborne illness concerns could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food safety issues at our QSRs, FSRs or our standalone restaurants, including any occurrences of foodborne illnesses. Some foodborne illness incidents could be caused by third-party vendors and transporters outside of our control. New illnesses resistant to our current precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, that could give rise to claims or allegations. One or more instances of foodborne illness in any of our QSRs, FSRs or our standalone restaurants or related to food products we offer could negatively affect our sales and results of operations if it involves serious illness or is highly publicized. This risk exists even if it were later determined that the illness was wrongly attributed to us or one of our standalone restaurants or travel center locations. A number of restaurant chains have experienced incidents related to foodborne illnesses that have had a material adverse effect on their operations. The occurrence of a similar incident at one or more of our locations, or negative publicity or public speculation about an incident, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential long-term changes in market, consumer and workplace practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could be detrimental to our business.\nTemporary closures of businesses and governmental stay in place orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in long-term changed market, professional driver and consumer practices that could negatively impact us and our business. For example, consumer demands and preferences for goods may change in a way that results in less transporting of goods over long distances and, hence, reduce demand for long-haul trucking, which would reduce the demand for our diesel fuel. In addition, some changes in consumer practices, including as a result of less driving for commuting for work if workplaces adopt permanent or increased work from home practices that have been adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, would result in decreased demand for gasoline for automobiles. Further, reductions in demand for diesel fuel and gasoline, and reductions of commercial activity generally, would result in less trucking and consumer driving, which, in turn, would lead to fewer customers visiting our travel centers and purchasing nonfuel products and services at our travel centers, including truck repair services and reductions in our offsite truck repair and maintenance sales. These results would likely materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur business and operations are subject to risks from adverse weather and climate events.\nSevere weather may have a material adverse effect on properties we own and the U.S. trucking industry. When severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, occur near our travel centers, we or our franchisees may need to suspend operations of any impacted travel centers until the event has ended, repairs are made and the impacted travel centers are ready for operation. In addition, severe weather across a geographic region may cause a material decrease in the movement of trucks and, as a result, in our business. We or franchisees of our travel centers may incur significant costs and losses as a result of severe weather, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our travel centers in anticipation of, during and after a severe weather event and in terms of lost business due to the interruption in operating our travel centers or decreased truck movements. Our insurance and our franchisees' insurance may not adequately compensate us or them for these costs and losses. In addition, some believe that the incidents of severe weather are increasing in frequency as a result of global climate change. Concerns about climate change and increasing storm intensities may increase the cost of insurance for our travel centers or practically render it unavailable to obtain.\nLabor disputes or other events may arise that restrict, reduce or otherwise negatively impact the movement of goods by trucks in the United States.\nA meaningful aspect of the U.S. trucking industry involves the movement of goods across the United States. Events that restrict, reduce or otherwise negatively impact the movement of those goods may adversely impact the trucking industry. In recent years, there were extended labor disputes at U.S. west coast ports that slowed the loading and unloading of goods at those ports. A large percentage of the goods that are loaded and unloaded at those ports are transported to and from those ports by trucking companies, including some who are our customers. Future labor disputes could disrupt the transportation of goods across the United States and remain unresolved for a prolonged period. Such a disruption may materially and adversely affect our business and our ability to operate profitable travel centers.\nWe may be unable to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nNet operating losses and other carryforwards are subject to limitations under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. For instance, carryforwards of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after 2020 generally will be able to offset no more than 80% of taxable income for tax years beginning after 2020. Moreover, net operating losses arising in taxable years prior to 2018 and various tax credits may only be carried forward for a limited number of years. These and other limitations could delay our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and could even cause some of these tax attributes to expire before they are used.\nIf we experience an ownership change, our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which currently are expected to be utilized to offset future taxable income, may be subject to limitations on usage or elimination. Our governing documents impose restrictions on the transfer and ownership of our shares of common stock that are intended to help us preserve the tax treatment of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; however, we cannot be certain that these restrictions will be effective. Please see below for a discussion of the risks related to our ownership limitations under the heading \"Risks Arising from Certain of Our Relationships and Our Organization and Structure.\"\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategies\nWe are in the process of executing new and expanded business strategies; we may fail to successfully execute these strategies and these strategies may prove to be unprofitable.\nOur success depends on our ability to grow our business and adapt our business model to changing market conditions. We are executing new and expanded business strategies. We launched a new smaller travel center format branded as TA Express, and, as of December 31, 2020, we have converted and opened 21 travel centers under this brand name, and we plan to expand our travel center business, including the TA Express brand, through franchising, development and acquisition opportunities. We also continue to grow our truck service business, particularly within our Road Squad\u00ae, TechOn-Site\u00ae and Commercial Tire Dealer Network\u2122 programs. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had entered into franchise agreements covering 33 travel centers under our travel center brand names. In October 2019, we entered into a multi unit franchise agreement with IHOP in which we agreed to rebrand and convert up to 94 of our FSRs to IHOP restaurants over five years, which period was extended by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in 2018 we commenced operating a commercial tire retread business with our acquisition and upgrade of a 32,000-square foot commercial tire retread facility in Bowling Green, Ohio that we anticipate will give us the ability to provide a complete tire management system and retread tires for national and local fleets, local industries, regional construction and agricultural segments. These new and expanded business strategies will take time to execute and require additional investment and, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were required to delay or modify certain of our initiatives. While we believe the pursuit of these business strategies will have a positive effect on our business in the long term, we cannot be certain that they will.\nOur growth strategies and our locations require regular and substantial capital investment.\nOur travel centers are open for business 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Due to the nature and intensity of the uses of our locations, they require regular and substantial expenditures for maintenance and capital investments to remain functional and attractive to customers. Although we may request that SVC purchase future renovations, improvements and equipment at the properties that we lease from SVC, SVC is not obligated to purchase any amounts and such purchases only relate to improvements to facilities we lease from SVC and not to facilities that we own or lease from others or to general business improvements, such as improvements to our IT systems.\nWe may be unable to obtain capital to fund our capital investments. If we are unable to raise capital at costs that are less than our returns on that capital, our businesses and profits may decline and our growth strategies may fail. Further, if we defer or forgo maintenance expenditures, our properties' competitiveness would likely be harmed and we may need to make larger capital expenditures in the future.\nAcquisitions may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits of our growth strategies or any particular transaction may not be fully realized.\nBusinesses and properties that we acquire often require substantial improvements to be brought up to our standards or to achieve our expected financial results. For example, improvements to our acquired travel centers are often extensive and require an extended period of time to plan, design, permit and complete, which is then followed by another period of time for the acquired travel center to become part of our customers' supply networks. Despite our efforts, the actual results of acquired properties may not improve under our management and may vary greatly from the results we expected when we made the acquisitions. These variances may occur due to many factors, including competition, the cost of improvements exceeding our estimates and our realization of less synergies and less cost savings than expected. Some of these factors are outside our control. If improvements are more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected or if reaching maturity takes longer than expected or does not occur at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nThe success of our growth strategies, and any particular acquisition, including the realization of anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine acquired businesses with ours. Integration of acquired businesses may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, may result in the loss of key employees or business disruption to us, or may adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits of the growth strategy or acquisition. If we experience difficulties, the anticipated benefits of a growth strategy or particular transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe may not complete our development projects within the time frame or for the investment we anticipate, or at all, and the anticipated benefits of the new facilities may not be fully realized.\nDeveloping a new location generally may be more risky than buying an existing operating location. Any development projects we plan could be delayed or not completed or could require a greater investment of capital or management time, or both, than we expect. Additionally, if we design, plan, permit or construct a project but do not complete it, we may incur substantial costs without realizing any expected benefits. Also, the facilities we construct may not generate the financial returns we anticipate.\nTerritorial restrictions placed on us by our leases with SVC and our franchise agreements with our franchisees could impair our ability to grow our business.\nUnder our leases with SVC, without the consent of SVC, we generally cannot own, franchise, finance, operate, lease or manage any travel center or similar property within 75 miles in either direction along the primary interstate on which a travel center owned by SVC is located. Additionally, under our leases with SVC, we have granted SVC a right of first refusal on the properties that are the subject of such leases. Under the terms of our franchise agreements for TA travel centers, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a travel center or travel center business that uses the TA brand in a specified territory for that TA branded franchise location. Under the terms of our franchise agreements for Petro travel centers, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a travel center or travel center business that uses the Petro brand in a specified territory for that Petro branded franchise location. As a result of these restrictions, we may be unable to develop, acquire or franchise a travel center in an area in which an additional travel center may be profitable, thereby losing an opportunity for future growth of our business.\nRisks Arising from Certain of Our Relationships and Our Organization and Structure\nOur agreements and relationships with SVC, RMR and others related to them may create conflicts of interest, or the perception of such conflicts, and may restrict our ability to grow our business.\nWe have significant commercial and other relationships with SVC, RMR and others related to them, including:\n\u2022we lease a large majority of our travel centers from SVC and our business is substantially dependent upon our relationship with SVC;\n\u2022SVC is our largest stockholder, owning 1.2 million, or approximately 8.1%, of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020;\n\u2022RMR provides us with business management services pursuant to a business management agreement and we pay RMR fees for those services based on a percentage of our fuel gross margin and nonfuel revenues. RMR also provides business and property management services to SVC;\n\u2022the Chair of our Board of Directors and one of our Managing Directors, Adam D. Portnoy, is the chair of the board of trustees and a managing trustee of SVC, owned 1.1% of SVC's outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2020, is a managing director and an officer and, as the sole trustee of ABP Trust, is the controlling shareholder of The RMR Group Inc. and is an officer and employee of RMR. The RMR Group Inc. is the managing member of RMR and RMR is the majority-owned operating subsidiary of The RMR Group Inc.;\n\u2022as of December 31, 2020, RMR owned 0.7 million, or approximately 4.5%, of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022our other Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan M. Pertchik, is an Executive Vice President of RMR;\n\u2022Peter J. Crage, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and Mark R. Young, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, are also officers of RMR;\n\u2022Adam D. Portnoy and most of our Independent Directors are members of the boards of trustees or boards of directors of other public companies to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services; and\n\u2022in the event of conflicts between us and RMR, any affiliate of RMR or any publicly owned entity with which RMR has a relationship, including SVC, our business management agreement allows RMR to act on its own behalf and on behalf of SVC or such other entity rather than on our behalf.\nIn an agreement with SVC entered in 2007 in connection with our spin off from SVC and in our SVC Leases, we granted SVC a right of first refusal to purchase, lease, mortgage or otherwise finance any interest we own in a travel center before we sell, lease, mortgage or otherwise finance that travel center with another party. Under the 2007 agreement, we also granted SVC and other entities to which RMR provides management services a right of first refusal to acquire or finance any real estate of the types in which they invest before we do. Additionally, under the SVC Leases, without the consent of SVC, we generally cannot own, franchise, finance, operate, lease or manage any travel center or similar property within 75 miles in either direction along the primary interstate on which a travel center owned by SVC is located. These rights of first refusal and noncompetition provisions could limit our ability to purchase or finance our properties or properties we may wish to invest in or acquire in the future. Also, under the 2007 agreement we agreed not to take any action that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on SVC's ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT. For more information regarding our transactions, leases and relationship with SVC, see Notes 3, 8 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report.\nThese relationships could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving us, SVC, RMR and others related to them. As a result of these relationships, our leases with SVC, management agreement with RMR and other transactions with SVC, RMR and others related to them were not negotiated on an arm's length basis between unrelated parties, and therefore the terms thereof may not be as favorable to us as they would have been if they were negotiated on an arm's length basis between unrelated parties. In the past, in particular following periods of volatility in the overall market or declines in the market price of a company's securities, dissident stockholder director nominations, dissident stockholder proposals and stockholder litigation have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. These activities, if instituted against us, and the existence of conflicts of interest or the perception of conflicts of interest, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management's attention and could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business and the market price of our shares of common stock and other securities.\nThe substantial majority of the travel centers that we operate are owned by SVC and our business is substantially dependent on our relationship with SVC. In addition, we have significant commercial arrangements with RMR and we are dependent on those arrangements in operating our business.\nOf the 271 travel centers we operate, 179, or 66%, are owned by SVC and, as a result, our business is substantially dependent on our relationship with SVC. We lease these travel centers pursuant to five long term leases with SVC. SVC may terminate our leases in certain circumstances, including if SVC does not receive annual minimum rent on the subject properties or for certain other events of default. Our business is substantially dependent upon our continued relationship with SVC. The loss of our leases with SVC, or a material change to their terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, we are party to a business management agreement with RMR whereby RMR assists us with various aspects of our business. As a result, we are dependent on our arrangements with RMR in operating our business and any adverse developments at RMR or in those arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to conduct our operations.\nOwnership limitations and certain other provisions in our charter, bylaws and certain material agreements may deter, delay or prevent a change in our control or unsolicited acquisition proposals.\nOur charter, or our Articles, and amended and restated bylaws, or bylaws, contain provisions that prohibit any stockholder from owning more than 5% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our outstanding shares of capital stock, including our common stock. The ownership limitation in our Articles and bylaws helps facilitate our compliance with our contractual obligations with SVC to not take actions that may conflict with SVC's status as a REIT under the Code and is intended to help us preserve the tax treatment of our tax credit carryforwards, net operating losses and other tax benefits. We also believe these provisions promote good orderly governance. However, these provisions may also inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nAdditionally, other provisions contained in our Articles and bylaws may also inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable, including, for example, provisions relating to:\n\u2022the division of our Board of Directors into three classes, with the term of one class expiring at each annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022the authority of our Board of Directors, and not our stockholders, to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws and to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of stockholders to cause a special meeting of stockholders to be held and a prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent unless the consent is a unanimous consent of all our stockholders entitled to vote on the matter;\n\u2022required qualifications for an individual to serve as a Director and a requirement that certain of our Directors be \u201cManaging Directors\u201d and other Directors be \u201cIndependent Directors,\u201d as defined in the governing documents;\n\u2022the power of our Board of Directors, without stockholders' approval, to authorize and issue additional shares of stock of any class or type on terms that it determines;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to propose nominees for election as Directors and propose other business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that an individual Director may be removed only for cause (as defined in our Articles) and then only by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast 75% of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors;\n\u2022a requirement that any matter that is not approved by our Board of Directors receive the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast 75% of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter;\n\u2022restrictions on business combinations between us and an interested stockholder that have not first been approved by our Board of Directors (including a majority of Directors not related to the interested stockholder);\n\u2022requirements that stockholders comply with regulatory requirements (including Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and Pennsylvania gaming) affecting us, which could effectively limit stock ownership of us including, in some cases, to 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock; and\n\u2022requirements that any person nominated to be a Director comply with any clearance and pre-clearance requirements of state gaming laws applicable to our business.\nIn addition, the SVC Leases and our business management agreement with RMR each provide that our rights and benefits under those agreements may be terminated in the event that anyone acquires more than 9.8% of our shares of capital stock or we experience some other change in control, as defined in those agreements, without the consent of SVC or RMR, respectively. Also, a change in control under our Credit Agreement or our $200.0 million Term Loan Facility would be deemed to occur if, among other reasons, RMR ceased to provide management services to us, and would constitute an event of default thereunder and under our Credit Facility and the lenders could accelerate the loans under our Credit Facility and our Term Loan Facility. Our obligation to repay deferred rent then outstanding under our amended leases with SVC may also be accelerated if, among other things, a Director not nominated or elected by the then members of our Board of Directors is elected to our Board of Directors or if our stockholders adopt a proposal (other than a precatory proposal) not recommended for adoption by the then members of our Board of Directors. For these reasons, among others, our stockholders may be unable to realize a change in control premium for securities they own of us or otherwise effect a change of our policies or a change of our control.\nAs changes occur in the marketplace for corporate governance policies, the above provisions may change or be removed, or new ones may be added.\nThe licenses, permits and related approvals for our operations may restrict ownership of us, or prevent or delay any change in control of us.\nWe have travel center locations in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and Pennsylvania that include gaming operations. As a result, we and our subsidiaries involved in these operations are subject to gaming regulations in those states. Under state gaming regulations, which vary by jurisdiction:\n\u2022stockholders whose ownership of our securities exceeds certain thresholds may be required to report their holdings to and to be licensed, found suitable or approved by the relevant state gaming authorities;\n\u2022persons seeking to acquire control over us or over the operation of our gaming licenses are subject to prior investigation by and approval from the relevant gaming authorities;\n\u2022persons who wish to serve as one of our Directors or officers may be required to be approved, found suitable and in some cases licensed, by the relevant state gaming authorities; and\n\u2022the relevant state gaming authorities may limit our involvement with, or ownership of, securities by persons they determine to be unsuitable.\nThe gaming regulations to which we are subject may discourage or prevent investors from nominating persons to serve as our Directors, from purchasing our securities, from attempting to acquire control of us or otherwise implementing changes that they consider beneficial.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our Directors, officers, SVC and RMR are limited.\nOur governing documents limit the liability of our Directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our Directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from (i) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (ii) active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nOur Articles also generally require us, to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law, to indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to, our present and former Directors and officers, SVC, RMR, and the respective trustees, directors and officers of SVC and RMR for losses they may incur arising from claims or actions in which any of them may be involved in connection with any act or omission by such person or entity on behalf of or with respect to us, unless, with respect to SVC, RMR, and the respective trustees, directors and officers of SVC and RMR, there has been a final, nonappealable judgment entered by an arbiter determining that such person or entity acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that his, her or its conduct was unlawful. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with our Directors and officers, which provide similar indemnification obligations with respect to such persons. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our present and former Directors and officers, SVC, RMR, and the respective trustees, directors and officers of SVC and RMR than might otherwise exist absent the provisions in our Articles and our indemnification agreements or that might exist with other companies, which could limit our stockholders' recourse in the event of actions not in our stockholders' best interest.\nStockholder litigation against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees may be referred to mandatory arbitration proceedings, which follow different procedures than in-court litigation and may be more restrictive to stockholders asserting claims than in-court litigation.\nOur stockholders agree, by virtue of becoming stockholders, that they are bound by our governing documents, including the arbitration provisions of our bylaws and Articles, as they may be amended from time to time. Our governing documents provide that certain actions by one or more of our stockholders against us or any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, including RMR and its successors, other than any request for a declaratory judgment or similar action regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our governing documents, will be referred to mandatory, binding and final arbitration proceedings if we, or any other party to such dispute, including any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, including RMR and its successors, unilaterally so demands. As a result, we and our stockholders would not be able to pursue litigation in state or federal court against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, including RMR and its successors, including, for example, claims alleging violations of federal securities laws or breach of duties, if we or any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, including RMR and its successors, against whom the claim is made unilaterally demands the matter be resolved by arbitration. Instead, our stockholders would be required to pursue such claims through binding and final arbitration.\nOur bylaws provide that such arbitration proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified in our governing documents. These procedures may provide materially more limited rights to our stockholders than litigation in a federal or state court. For example, arbitration in accordance with these procedures does not include the opportunity for a jury trial, document discovery is limited, arbitration hearings generally are not open to the public, there are no witness depositions in advance of arbitration hearings and arbitrators may have different qualifications or experiences than judges. In addition, although our governing documents' arbitration provisions contemplate that arbitration may be brought in a representative capacity or on behalf of a class of our stockholders, the rules governing such representation or class arbitration may be different from, and less favorable to stockholders than, the rules governing representative or class action litigation in courts. Our governing documents also generally provide that each party to such an arbitration is required to bear its own costs in the arbitration, including attorneys' fees, and that the arbitrators may not render an award that includes shifting of such costs or, in a derivative or class proceeding, award any portion of our award to any stockholder or such stockholder's attorneys. The arbitration provisions of our governing documents may discourage our stockholders from bringing, and attorneys from agreeing to represent our stockholders wishing to bring, litigation against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, including RMR and its successors. Our agreements with SVC and RMR have similar arbitration provisions to those in our governing documents.\nWe believe that the arbitration provisions in our governing documents are enforceable under both state and federal law, including with respect to federal securities laws claims. We are a Maryland corporation and Maryland courts have upheld the enforceability of arbitration bylaws. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld agreements to arbitrate other federal statutory claims, including those that implicate important federal policies. However, some academics, legal practitioners and others are of the view that charter or bylaw provisions mandating arbitration are not enforceable with respect to federal securities laws claims. It is possible that the arbitration provisions of our governing documents may ultimately be determined to be unenforceable.\nBy agreeing to the arbitration provisions of our governing documents, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance by us with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nOur bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a judicial forum they deem favorable for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, manager, agents or employees.\nOur bylaws currently provide that, unless the dispute has been referred to binding arbitration, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours arising pursuant to Maryland law, our charter or bylaws brought by or on behalf of a stockholder, either on his, her or its own behalf, on our behalf or on behalf of any series or class of shares of stock of ours or by stockholders against us or any Director, officer, agent, or employee of ours, or our manager, including any disputes, claims or controversies relating to the meaning, interpretation, effect, validity, performance or enforcement of the charter or bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, agent, employee, or manager of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws currently also provide that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for any dispute, or portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not apply to any action for which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland does not have jurisdiction or to a dispute that has been referred to binding arbitration in accordance with our bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not establish exclusive jurisdiction in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland for claims that arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws if there is exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction in the federal courts. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our common shares shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. The arbitration and exclusive forum provisions of our bylaws may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, agents, employees, or our manager, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our Directors, officers, agents, employees or our manager.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur capital stock has experienced significant price and trading volume volatility and may continue to do so.\nSince we became a publicly traded company in January 2007, our capital stock has experienced significant share price and trading volatility, which may continue. The market price of our shares of capital stock has fluctuated and could fluctuate significantly in the future in response to various factors and events, including, but not limited to, the risks set out in this Annual Report, as well as:\n\u2022the liquidity of the market for our capital stock;\n\u2022our historic policy to not pay cash dividends;\n\u2022changes in our operating results;\n\u2022issuances of additional shares of capital stock and sales of our capital stock by holders of large blocks of our capital stock, such as SVC, RMR or our Directors or officers;\n\u2022limited analyst coverage, changes in analysts' expectations and unfavorable research reports; and\n\u2022general economic and industry trends and conditions.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.\nRecently, global and U.S. financial markets have experienced heightened volatility, including as a result of uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actual and potential shifts in U.S. and foreign trade, economic and other policies. This volatility and uncertainty could have a significant impact on the markets for our capital stock and our Senior Notes, the markets in which we operate and a material adverse impact on our business prospects and financial condition.\nAny future equity issuances we may make may significantly dilute our stockholders' equity interests.\nThe trading price of our shares of common stock is currently below the trading prices we have experienced in the past. If we issue additional shares of common stock at or near current trading price levels, certain of our pre-existing stockholders, especially our long term stockholders, may experience dilution of their equity interests.\nInvestors may not benefit financially from investing in our Senior Notes.\nThe indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued contains no financial covenants or other provisions that would afford the holders of the Senior Notes any substantial protection in the event we participate in a material transaction. In addition, the indenture does not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur or our ability to pay dividends, make distributions or repurchase our shares of common stock. Additionally, investors in our Senior Notes may be adversely affected as a result of the following:\n\u2022the Senior Notes are unsecured and effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness;\n\u2022an active trading market for the Senior Notes may not be maintained or be liquid;\n\u2022we depend upon our subsidiaries for cash flow to service our debt, and the Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the payment of the indebtedness, lease and other liabilities and any preferred equity of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022an increase in market interest rates and other factors could result in a decrease in the value of the Senior Notes.", "PERMNO": 91727, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "TA"}
