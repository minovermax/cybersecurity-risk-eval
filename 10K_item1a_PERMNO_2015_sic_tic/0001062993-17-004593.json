RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nBusiness Risks\nWe may be forced to delisting from NYSE Exchange if we are failure to satisfy a continued listing rule or standard.\nOn April 18, 2017, we received a letter from NYSE MKT LLC (the \u201cExchange\u201d) stating that the Exchange has determined that we are not in compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d) due to we are failure to timely file with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The letter also states that the failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K is a material violation of its listing agreement with the Exchange and, therefore, pursuant to Section 1003(d) of the Company Guide, the Exchange is authorized to suspend and, unless prompt corrective action is taken, remove the Company\u2019s securities from the Exchange. The Exchange has informed us that, in order to maintain its listing on the Exchange, we must, by May 18, 2017, submit a plan of compliance (the \u201cPlan\u201d) advising the Exchange of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the Company Guide by October 18, 2017 (the \u201cPlan Period\u201d). The Plan was submitted and accepted by the Exchange, allowing us to be able to continue listing during the Plan Period. However, based on recent discussions with the Exchange, the Exchange staff may initiate delisting proceedings. Because we have not filed all of our required SEC reports as of the close of the Plan Period, among other concerns.\nOur operating results may have been material adverse effected during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the restatement of prior financial statements\nWe have discovered errors in the timing of revenues recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. We recognize revenue upon shipping of products to its customers where title of the goods passes upon departure from our facilities; however, in certain instances, contractual terms dictate that the customers are afforded seven days after the receipt of goods at their premises to inspect the goods for defects or spoilage and notify us. If we are not contacted within those seven days, our obligation to the customer are considered fully discharged and revenue should be recognized. Given the timing of these seven days, we believe that certain sales transactions have been erroneously recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. We have rectified this error and the impact of our financial position and result of operations during the year ended December 31, 2015, which may result in material adverse effect.\nWe lack the ability to sustain our operations if our cash flow continues to decline and cannot be replenished through financing\nOur financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis. The going-concern basis assumes that assets will be realized and liabilities will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the amounts disclosed in the financial statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is greatly dependent on our ability to realize its non-cash current assets such as receivables and inventory into cash in order to settle its current obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a substantial loss of $136,361,080. As of December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $21,271,226. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to whether we may continue as a going concern. To improve our solvency, we are working to obtain new working capital through private placements of our common stock or convertible debt securities to qualified investors. But we cannot assure the financing succeed.\nWe may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of high quality raw materials.\nOur business depends on obtaining a reliable supply of various agricultural products, including chestnuts, vegetables, fruits, red meat, fish, eggs, rice, flour and packaging products. During 2016, the cost of our raw materials decreased from $143,226,607 to $85,249,363, a decrease of approximately 40.48% . We may have to increase the number of our suppliers of raw materials and expand our own agricultural operations in the future to meet growing production demands. Despite our efforts to control our supply of raw materials and maintain good relationships with our suppliers, we could lose one or more of our suppliers at any time. The loss of several suppliers may be difficult to replace and could increase our reliance on higher cost or lower quality suppliers, which could negatively affect our profitability. In addition, if we have to increase the number of our suppliers of raw materials in the future to meet growing production demands, we may not be able to locate new suppliers who could provide us with sufficient materials to meet our needs. Any interruptions to, or decline in, the amount or quality of our raw materials supply could materially disrupt our production and adversely affect our business and financial condition and financial prospects.\nThe prices that we have paid for our raw materials recently have experienced significant fluctuation. If these price fluctuations continue, our profit margins may be materially adversely affected.\nThe average price that we paid for chestnuts in China in 2015 and 2016 was approximately $1,600 per metric ton and $1,765 per metric ton, respectively, excluding value added taxes. We do not currently hedge against changes in our raw material prices. Consequently, if the costs of our raw materials increase further, and we are unable to offset these increases by raising the prices of our products, our profit margins and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nPrice inflation in China could affect our results of operation if we are unable to pass along raw material price increases to our customers.\nInflation in China has been consistently increasing in recent years. Because we purchase raw materials from suppliers in China, price inflation directly causes an increase in the cost of our raw materials. Price inflation could affect our results of operation if we are unable to pass along raw material price increases to customers. In addition, if inflationary trends continue in China, China could lose its competitive advantage as a low-cost manufacturing venue, which could in turn lessen some of the competitive advantages of our being based in China. Accordingly, inflation in China may weaken our competitiveness domestically or in international markets.\nOur sales and reputation may be affected by product liability claims, litigation or, product recalls in relation to our products.\nThe sale of products for human consumption involves an inherent risk of injury to consumers. We face risks associated with product liability claims, litigation, or product recalls, if our products cause injury or become adulterated or misbranded. Our products are subject to product tampering and contamination, such as mold, bacteria, insects, shell fragments and off-flavor contamination, during any of the procurement, production, transportation and storage processes. If any of our products were to be tampered with, or become tainted in any of these respects, and we were unable to detect this, our products could be subject to product liability claims or product recalls. Our ability to sell products could be reduced if certain pesticides, herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of our raw materials or if our raw materials have been contaminated by other agents.\nWe have never had any major product recall in the past but we have experienced product liability claims that were made by our customers. The amounts of such claims were immaterial. However, claims of product defect or product liability for material amounts, individually or in the aggregate, may be made in the future.\nWe have not procured a product liability or general liability insurance policy for our business, as the insurance industry in China is still in an early stage of development. To the extent that we suffer a loss of a type which would normally be covered by product liability or general liability insurance in the United States, we would incur significant expenses in defending any action against us and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or judgment against us. Product liability claims and product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and on our business goodwill and reputation. Adverse publicity could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products.\nOur expansion strategy may not prove successful and could adversely affect our existing business.\nOur growth strategy includes the expansion of our manufacturing operations, including new production lines and agricultural operations. We plan to expand our sales in China and internationally. We will need to engage in various forms of promotional and marketing activities in order to further develop the branding of our products and to increase our market share in new and existing markets. The implementation of this strategy may involve large transactions and present financial, managerial and operational challenges. We could also experience financial or other setbacks if any of our growth strategies incur problems of which we are not presently aware. If we fail to generate sufficient sales in new markets or increase our sales in existing markets, we may not be able to recover the production, distribution, promotional and marketing expenses, as well as administrative costs we have incurred in developing such markets.\nOur results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which our customers operate.\nSeveral of our customers have operations in locations that are subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather and geological events, which could disrupt the operations of those customers and suppliers as well as our operations. If our customers suffer from these events, their operations may be negatively impacted. As a result, some or all of those customers may reduce their orders for our products, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe acquisition of other businesses could pose risks to our profitability.\nWe may try to grow through acquisitions in the future. Any proposed acquisition could result in accounting charges, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, and increased debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our existing business and the market price of our common stock. Acquisitions, in general, entail many risks, including risks relating to the failed integration of the acquired operations, diversion of management\u2019s attention, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired organizations. We may be unable to successfully integrate businesses or the personnel of any business that might be acquired in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock.\nA significant amount of our revenues is dependent on a limited number of customers and the loss of any one of our major customers could materially and adversely affect our growth and our revenues.\nA significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from a limited number of customers, particularly in our chestnut products segment. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 12.3% and 12.1% of our total revenues in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The loss of any one of these customers, or a material decrease in purchases by any one of these customers, could adversely impact our revenues.\nWe rely primarily on distributors to sell our products. Any delays in delivery or poor handling by our distributors or third-party transport operators may affect our sales and damage our reputation.\nIn 2016, we sold our products through over 130 distribution service providers. The services provided could be suspended and could cause interruption to the supply of our products to domestic or overseas customers. Delivery disruptions may occur for various reasons beyond our control, including poor handling by service providers or third party transport operators, transportation bottlenecks, natural disasters and labor strikes, and could lead to delayed, damaged or lost deliveries. If our products are not delivered in a timely manner, our reputation could be harmed. If our products are damaged in the process of being delivered, we may be liable to pay for such damages incurred.\nFailure of the market to accept our new products, or failure to obtain regulatory approval for our new products, may cause us to lose our competitive position in the food industry.\nWe introduced 7 new products in 2012, 6 new products in 2013, 3 new products in 2014, 6 new products in 2015 and 1 new product in 2016. We plan to introduce approximately 5 new products in 2017. The success of the new products we introduce depends on our ability to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. We intend to introduce new products as well as alternative flavors, sizes and packaging for our existing products. We may not be able to gain market acceptance for our new products. Consumer preferences change, and any new products that we introduce may fail to meet the particular tastes or requirements of consumers, or may be unable to replace their existing preferences. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these particular tastes or changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause us to be unable to recover our development, production and marketing costs.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our research and development, operations and revenue.\nThe Lorain Group Companies were founded in 1994 by Si Chen, our chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Chen, together with other senior management, has been a key driver of our strategy and has been fundamental to our achievements to date. The successful management of our business is, to a considerable extent, dependent on the services of Mr. Chen and other senior management. We compete for qualified personnel with other food processing companies, food retailers and research institutions. Consequently, we may either lose key employees to our competitors or we may need to significantly increase the compensation of such employees in order to retain them. The loss of the services of any key management employee or failure to recruit a suitable or comparable replacement could have a significant impact upon our ability to manage our business effectively, and our business and future growth may be adversely affected.\nWe face increasing competition from domestic and foreign companies.\nThe food industry in China is fragmented. Our ability to compete against other national and international enterprises is, to a significant extent, dependent on our ability to distinguish our products from those of our competitors by providing large volumes of high quality products that appeal to consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences at reasonable prices. Some of our competitors have been in business longer than we have and are more established. Our competitors may provide products comparable or superior to those we provide or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements. Increased competition may result in price reductions, higher raw materials prices, reduced margins and loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our profit margins.\nAn increase in the cost of energy could affect our profitability.\nAlthough energy costs were stable in 2016, we might experience significant increases in energy costs in the future, which would result in higher distribution, freight and other operating costs. Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases.\nOur products are subject to counterfeiting or imitation, which could impact our reputation.\nTo date, we have experienced limited counterfeiting and imitation of our products. However, counterfeiting or imitation of our products may occur in the future and we may not be able to detect it and deal with it effectively. Any occurrence of counterfeiting or imitation could impact negatively upon our reputation, particularly if the counterfeit or imitation products cause sickness, or injury to consumers. In addition, counterfeit or imitation products could result in our need to incur costs with respect to the detection or prosecution of such activities.\nWe may face challenges in expanding our cross-border operations\nAs we continue expanding our existing cross-border operations into existing and other markets, we will face risks associated with expanding into markets in which we have limited or no experience. The expansion of our cross-border business will also expose us to risks relating to staffing and managing cross-border operations, tariffs and other trade barriers, differing and potentially adverse tax consequences, increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements and policies, lack of acceptance of our products, challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences, exchange rate risk and political instability. Accordingly, any efforts we make to expand our cross-border operations may not be successful, which could limit our ability to grow our revenue, net income and profitability.\nWe may have liquidity risk in relating to the decrease of cash flow and the bad debt loss.\nWe have a markedly decrease on our revenue from sales in 2016. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) were $1.4 million and $25.5 million, respectively. The decrease of cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) are by $18.7 million, or by 36.5% due to the bad debt loss. If we cannot increase the quantity of our products sales, we may not be available to manage cash flow.\nWe may no longer be able to compete in Europe and have suffered significant losses in China.\nWe terminated the French operation due to its operational loss. We suffered from the investigation with respect to the origin of canned chestnuts sold by Conserverie Minerve (\u201cMinerve\u201d, a former subsidiary of Athena) issued Centre Technique Conservation of Produits Agricoles (\u201cCTCPA\u201d), an industry trade association for canned, preserved and dehydrated food products in France. CTCPA stated that only chestnuts based on the European or Japanese cultivars can be used in canned chestnut products sold in France according to CTCPA policies and that canned chestnut products must also have received certification from the International Featured Standards (\u201cIFS\u201d), a qualified third party certification agency in Europe that certifies food products, especially for retail industry. Although, a proceeding from local court provided Minerve (now Athena) protection from creditors initiating any actions against Athena until March 2016, Athena still cost a lot to recycle market products, seal the finished products, and thousands of tons of chestnuts during 2016.\nSince the sales of revenue from Chinese market decreased by 46.05% in 2016 and we may lose our Europe market due to the termination of our French company, our competition advantage has been greatly weakened.\nChinese chestnut sales declined due to natural hazard and fierce market competition.\nChinese Domestic sales of chestnuts has decreased due to competition from the market and the raw material expense increased. In 2016, Luotian, Hubei, our main chestnuts supply area, has been hit by flooding, cutting chestnuts production by about 50% and the purchase price increased by 20% to 30%. As in previous years, the annual chestnuts output was 40,000 tons in Luotian, accounted for 8% of the Chinese chestnut production. About 50% chestnuts in Luotian supplied to Luotian market to further processing, and about 20% of which supplied to Wuhan market. But, due to the rise in price in 2016, less than 20% will be supplied to Luotian market. However, other main chestnuts producing area in China were harvest in China which result in a much lower price compared with that in Luotian. Our chestnuts purchased in Luotian much increased by 20% and the sales revenue in Luotian Lorain was deceased by 44.9 % in 2016.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive regulations by the Chinese government.\nThe food industry is subject to extensive regulations by Chinese government agencies. Among other things, these regulations govern the manufacturing, importation, processing, packaging, storage, exportation, distribution and labeling of our products. New or amended statutes and regulations, increased production at our existing facilities, and our expansion into new operations and jurisdictions may require us to obtain new licenses and permits and could require us to change our methods of operations at costs that could be substantial.\nOur failure to comply with PRC environmental laws may require us to incur significant costs.\nWe carry on our business in an industry that is subject to PRC environmental protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require enterprises engaged in manufacturing and construction that may cause environmental waste to adopt effective measures to control such waste. In addition, such enterprises are required to pay fines, or to cease operations entirely under extreme circumstances, should they discharge waste substances. The Chinese government may also change the existing laws or regulations or impose additional or stricter laws or regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers through higher prices for our products.\nOur failure to comply with PRC hygiene laws may require us to incur significant costs.\nManufacturers in the Chinese food industry are subject to compliance with PRC food hygiene laws and regulations. These food hygiene laws require all enterprises engaged in the production of chestnuts and various vegetables and fruits to obtain a hygiene license for each of their production facilities. Such laws also require manufacturers to comply with regulations with respect to food, food additives, packaging, and food production sites, facilities and equipment. Failure to comply with PRC food hygiene laws may result in fines, suspension of operations, loss of hygiene licenses and, in more extreme cases, criminal proceedings against an enterprise and its management. The Chinese government may also change the existing laws or regulations or impose additional or stricter laws or regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers through higher prices for our products.\nChinese government forcing relocation may require us to incur significant costs.\nShandong Lorain was demanded to move its production lines to the factory of Junan Hongrun according to a new city zoning plan where Shandong Lorain resident, so that the land can be used for other urban use. Shandong Lorain has started this relocation process in July 2016 and finished this process in December,2016. During the relocation process, we were not allowed to produce our products with full capacity. As a result, the revenue from sales of chestnuts food products was $ 30.4 million and $54.3 million in 2016 and in 2015, respectively, decreasing by approximately 44%.\nWe cannot predict when the compensation for relocation will be received and whether the amount of compensation for land requisition can make up for our loss during the relocation period. If we cannot receive sufficient compensation next year, the relocation will cost us a significant loss.\nFinancial Risks\nOur operations are cash intensive, and our business could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain sufficient levels of working capital.\nWe spend a significant amount of cash on our operations, principally to procure raw materials for our products. Many of our suppliers, including chestnut, vegetable and fruit farmers, and suppliers of packaging materials, do not allow us to pay on credit. However, some of the suppliers with whom we have a long-standing business relationship allow us to pay on credit. We fund the majority of our working capital requirements out of cash flow generated from operations. If we fail to generate sufficient sales, or if our suppliers stop offering us credit terms, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operating costs and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe also fund approximately 30.2% of our working capital requirements from the proceeds of short-term loans from Chinese and overseas banks. Our average loan balance from short-term bank loans in 2016 was approximately $30.7 million. We expect to continue to do so in the future. Such loans are generally secured by our fixed assets, receivables and/or guarantees by third parties. The term of almost all such loans is one year or less. Historically, we have rolled over such loans on an annual basis. However, we may not be able to roll over such loans in the future or may not have sufficient funds available to pay all of our borrowings upon maturity. Failure to roll over our short-term borrowings at maturity or to service our debt could result in the imposition of penalties, including increases in rates of interest, legal actions against us by our creditors, or even insolvency.\nManagement anticipates that our existing capital resources and cash flows from operations and current and expected short-term bank loans will be adequate to satisfy our liquidity requirements through 2017. However, if available liquidity is not sufficient to meet our operating and loan obligations as they come due, our plans include considering pursuing alternative financing arrangements or further reducing expenditures as necessary to meet our cash requirements. However, there is no assurance that, if required, we will be able to raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide the required liquidity. Currently, the capital markets for small capitalization companies are difficult and banking institutions have become stringent in their lending requirements. Accordingly, we cannot be sure of the availability or terms of any third party financing.\nWe are subject to credit risk in respect of accounts receivables.\nIn 2008 and 2009, some of our customers, including some of our large supermarket customers, delayed their payments for up to 60 to 90 days beyond their term. Our cash flow suffered while waiting for such payments. Consequently, at times we had to delay payments to our suppliers and to postpone business expansion as a result of these delayed payments. Starting in 2008 and through 2016, we gradually shortened credit terms for many of our domestic customers from between 30 and 180 days to between 30 and 60 days; international customers are typically extended 90 days credit. Our large customers may fail to meet these shortened credit terms, in which case we may not have sufficient cash flow to fund our operating costs and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may enter into additional financing agreements which may have a dilutive effect to our earnings per share and the rights of certain stockholders.\nAdditional financings could result in significant dilution to our earnings per share or the issuance of securities with rights superior to our current outstanding securities. We may also grant registration rights to investors purchasing our equity or debt securities in the future.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital.\nIf we are unable to raise additional financing when needed, we may be unable to implement our long-term business plan, develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, a lack of additional financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations.\nWe may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal control over financial reporting and our ability to have such controls attested to by our independent auditors.\nThe SEC, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to provide in their annual reports on Form 10-K a report by management with respect to the company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are currently required to comply with this requirement. In addition, such rules require the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a company\u2019s financial statements to attest to the operating effectiveness of such company\u2019s internal controls. However, because we are a smaller reporting company, we are not required to receive an attestation report from a registered public accounting firm. We can provide no assurance that we will comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby. Further, we cannot assure that we will receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors. Investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements in the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or if we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls.\nWe defaulted on debt relating to our bad operation performance and lack of finance from funding activities.\nPursuant to a Share Pledge Agreement, dated October 19, 2010 (the \u201cShare Pledge Agreement\u201d), Mr. Si Chen, our chief executive officer and chairman, has pledged 5,313,574 shares of Common Stock (the \u201cPledged Shares\u201d) for the benefit of DEG-Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellshaft mbH (\u201cDEG\u201d) in order to secure the obligations of the Company and its subsidiary Junan Hongrun Foodstuff Co., Ltd. (\u201cJunan Hongrun\u201d) under a Loan Agreement, dated May 31, 2010, among the Company, DEG and Mr. Si Chen (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d). In the event that the value of the pledged assets is less than 150% of the amounts made available to the Junan Hongrun under the Loan Agreement, DEG has the right to require additional security in the form of fixed assets or shares under the Loan Agreement and Share Pledge Agreement. Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated November 15, 2012, Mr. Si Chen has pledged an additional 5,480,492 shares of Common Stock to DEG under the Pledge Agreement in order to secure the obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Agreement. The total number of shares pledged under the Pledge Agreement is now 10,794,066 shares of Common Stock. For so long as no event of default under the Loan Agreement has occurred, Mr. Si Chen continues to retain all voting rights with respect to the Pledged Shares.\nOn September 7, 2016, DEG acquired beneficial ownership of 10,794,066 shares of Common Stock upon foreclosure of the pledge from Mr. Si Chen. Such shares constitute approximately 28.2% of the total number of shares of Common Stock of the Issuer outstanding as of September 30, 2016.\nIf we were unable to pay off the loan on time to DEG due to the bad performance of our operation and decrease of our revenue in the near future, DEG has right to acquired more shares of Common Stock pledged by Mr. Si Chen.\nWe may suffer other defaults on our debt due to our poor performance.\nRisks Related To Doing Business In China\nChanges in China\u2019s political or economic situation could harm us and our operating results.\nEconomic reforms adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of the country. However, the Chinese government could change these economic reforms at any time. Such changes could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nThe structure of the Chinese economy may inhibit our ability to expand our business.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, in several ways. For example, state-owned enterprises constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy. In addition, weak corporate governance practices and the lack of flexible currency exchange policies continue to persist. As a result of these differences, we may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy were similar to those of the OECD member countries.\nOur business is largely subject to the uncertain legal environment in China.\nThe Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which precedents set in earlier legal cases are not generally used. Laws, regulations and legal requirements relating to foreign investments in China are still evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors, such as the right of foreign enterprises to hold required business licenses and permits.\nIt may be difficult for our stockholders to effect service of process against our subsidiaries or our officers and directors.\nOur operating subsidiaries were organized under the laws of China and France and substantially all of their assets are located outside the U.S. In addition, our executive officers and directors are residents of China and substantially all of their assets are located outside the U.S. As a result, it could be difficult for our stockholders to effect service of process in the U.S., or to enforce a judgment obtained in the U.S., against our officers and directors in China.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively.\nThe majority of our revenues are settled in Renminbi and U.S. dollars, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in Renminbi to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the Renminbi for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain. For instance, foreign enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents at banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. The Chinese regulatory authorities may impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi in the future.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may have negative effects on our company.\nIn October 2005, the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, generally referred to as Circular 75, which required PRC residents to register with the local SAFE branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of China on the strength of domestic PRC assets originally held by those residents. Internal implementing guidelines issued by SAFE, which became public in June 2007 (known as Notice 106), further expanded the reach of Circular 75.\nILH acquired certain interests in the Lorain Group Companies controlled by Si Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to Circular 75 and Notice 106, if a PRC resident has completed a round-trip investment through its established SPV but has not yet completed the required procedures of SAFE registration for offshore investment of the SPV, he must retroactively register the SPV with SAFE.\nIn order to avoid such SAFE registration requirements, a Japanese individual, Hisashi Akazawa, was designated as a nominee holder of ILH when ILH was established. Mr. Akazawa granted an option to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Chen, allowing Mr. Chen to buy 90% of Mr. Akazawa\u2019s interest in the Company at a fixed price at a future time in accordance with the terms of an option agreement between the two parties. On December 22, 2008, Mr. Chen exercised this option. In addition, on that date, Mr. Chen acquired all of the remaining shares of our company held by Mr. Akazawa. As a result, Mr. Chen is the beneficiary of ILH and may be required to register with and obtain approvals from SAFE or its agency with respect to the direct offshore investment activities related to the acquisition of the Lorain Group Companies.\nIf the failure to identify and characterize Mr. Chen as a beneficial owner of ILH is determined by the PRC authorities to be a serious violation of the requirements of the PRC Company Law and the PRC Regulation of Registration of Companies, the Lorain Group Companies may be ordered by the company registration authority in the PRC to make corrections on its filed registration, to be fined an amount no less than RMB 5,000 and no more than RMB 50,000 or, in the worse scenario, to have its company registration certificate revoked or its business licenses canceled.\nOn July 14, 2014, the SAFE issued the Circular Relating to Foreign Exchange Administration of Offshore Investment, Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents Through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37. Circular 37 repeals and replaces the Notice Concerning Foreign Exchange Controls on Domestic Residents\u2019 Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 75. Under Circular 37, PRC residents are required to register with the SAFE or its local branches prior to establishing, or acquiring control of, an offshore company for the purpose of investment or financing that offshore company with equity interests in, or assets of, a PRC enterprise or with offshore equity interest or assets legally held by such PRC resident. In addition, PRC residents are required to amend their registrations with the SAFE and its local branches to reflect any material changes with respect to such PRC resident\u2019s investment in such offshore company, including changes to basic information of such PRC resident, increase or decrease in capital, share transfer or share swap, merger or division. In the event that a PRC shareholder fails to make the required registration or update the previously filed registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to their offshore parent company, and the offshore parent company may also be prohibited from contributing additional capital into its PRC subsidiaries. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liability under the PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.\nWe have requested our relevant shareholders who are subject to the SAFE regulations to make the necessary registrations under the SAFE regulations. However, we may not be fully informed of the identities of the beneficial owners of our company. We do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE regulations. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to comply with these SAFE registrations may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Furthermore, since Circular 37 was recently promulgated and it is unclear how this regulation, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to our company. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the failure to identify, characterize and register Mr. Chen as a beneficial owner of ILH is determined by the PRC authorities to be a violation of the requirements of registration and disclosure under new Circular 37, the Lorain Group Companies may be ordered by the authority in the PRC to make corrections on its filed registration, to be fined an amount up to RMB 50,000 for Mr. Chen and up to RMB 300,000 for the Lorain Group Companies.\nFurthermore, since Circular 37 was recently promulgated and it is unclear how this regulation, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to our company. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition is affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi.\nOur financial condition is affected by the foreign exchange rates, primarily the rate between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi, as well as Euro and Renminbi. In the event that the Renminbi appreciates against the U.S. dollar and Euro, our costs will increase.\nWe may encounter credit risks from our suppliers in China.\nOur Procurement staff left before goods were verified and received into inventory. We did not place significant new orders or make additional payments to vendors and suppliers, especially, peasant suppliers whom do not abide by contract law and have not fulfilled their obligations.\nRisks Related To the Market For Our Stock\nCertain of our stockholders have the ability to delay or prevent adoption of important business decisions based on their ownership of a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities.\nDEG is the record owner of approximately 28.2% of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, DEG possesses significant influence over our business.\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change-in-control.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors without further action by the stockholders. These terms may contain voting rights, including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights and redemption rights provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult to acquire our company and could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on your investment may be limited to the value of the shares you acquire.\nOther than a special cash dividend which we paid to holders of our common stock as of April 16, 2007, we have never declared or paid cash dividends. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and any return on your investment may be limited to the value of the shares of our common stock that you acquire. We currently intend to retain and use any future earnings for the development and expansion of our business.", "PERMNO": 93012, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "PLAG"}
