{"cik": "926617", "company": "Aspira Women's Health Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and uncertainties together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in Part II Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d If any of the following risks materializes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline significantly. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted, and are expected to further adversely impact, our business, results of operations and financial condition, and such future adverse impact may be material. In addition, other health epidemics, outbreaks or pandemics may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and the disease caused by it, COVID-19, as well as its variants. If infection rates rise or if significant action is taken to contain the pandemic again in the future, we will likely experience similar impacts as we had in 2020 and 2021, which include test volume decreases, challenges for our sales force, including limiting the ability to make in-person sales calls, shortages of skilled labor, and difficulty recruiting participants in studies, and as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition are likely to be adversely affected. To the extent our testing volumes decrease or we are unable to collect from patient payers, our revenues, cash flows from operations and liquidity will be adversely impacted. Although the impacts of COVID-19 on our business have lessened as compared to earlier periods of the pandemic, there is no assurance that sales or collections will return to normal levels during 2022 or at any time thereafter.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nIf we are unable to increase the volume of OVA1 sales, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception, and we expect to incur a net loss for fiscal year 2022. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative costs and research and development. The number of OVA1 tests performed in 2020 and 2021 was 13,557 and 17,359, respectively. If we are unable to increase the volume of OVA1 sales, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nFailures by third-party payers to reimburse for our products and services or changes in reimbursement rates could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in medical society guidelines may also adversely affect payers and result in a material change in coverage, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are responsible for obtaining payment from third-party payers. Accordingly, our future revenues will be dependent upon third-party reimbursement payments to ASPiRA LABS. Insurance coverage and reimbursement rates for diagnostic tests are uncertain, subject to change and particularly volatile during the early stages of commercialization. There remain questions as to what extent third-party payers, like Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies will provide coverage for OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus, Aspira GenetiX and Aspira Synergy and for which indications. While CMS has issued PAMA reimbursement rates for OVA1 and OVERA effective January 1, 2018, there is no guarantee that CMS will continue to cover the OVA1 test or that the payment rate will be comparable to the PAMA rate. Although the PAMA legislation allows for no more than a 15% fee reduction between 2021 and 2023, uncertainty regarding reimbursement rates could create payment uncertainty from other payers as well. The reimbursement rates for OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus, OVAWatch, Aspira GenetiX and Aspira Synergy are largely out of our control. We have experienced volatility in the coverage and reimbursement of OVA1 and OVERA due to contract negotiation with third-party payers and implementation requirements, and the reimbursement amounts we have received from third-party payers varies from payer to payer, and, in some cases, the variance is material.\nThird-party payers, including private insurance companies as well as government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services including increased use of Laboratory Benefits Management firms (\u201cLBM\u2019s\u201d). In addition, more payers are implementing pre-authorization requirements for our testing. These measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization of diagnostic tests such as OVA1 and OVERA.\nFurther, the trend among many payers is to limit the size of their lab networks, which is making it more difficult to secure preferred provider contracts for some services. From time to time, Congress has considered and implemented changes to the Medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation, and pricing for tests covered by Medicare is subject to change at any time, although PAMA has established specific dates by which they will make any changes. Reductions in third-party payer reimbursement rates may occur in the future. Reductions in the price at which OVA1 and OVERA is reimbursed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our products or if third-party payers change their coverage or reimbursement policies with respect to our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to continue to develop our existing technologies, we may not be able to successfully foster adoption of our products and services.\nOur technologies are new and complex and are subject to change as new discoveries are made. New discoveries and advancements in the diagnostic field are essential if we are to foster the adoption of our product offerings. Development of our existing technologies remains a substantial risk to us due to various factors, including the scientific challenges involved within our laboratory, as well as products that are offered in a decentralized structure (Aspira Synergy), our ability to find and collaborate successfully with others working in the diagnostic field, and competing technologies, which may prove more successful than our technologies, as well as failure to complete analytical and clinical validation studies and failure to demonstrate sufficient clinical utility to continue to build positive medical policy among payers.\nWe are currently developing multiple tests as LDTs, and intend to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS in the future. Should FDA disagree that our tests are LDTs in the future, commercialization of our diagnostic tests may be adversely affected, which would negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also intend to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS in the future. The FDA considers an LDT to be a test that is designed, developed, validated, and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has historically taken the position that it has the authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices under the FDC Act, but it has generally exercised enforcement discretion with regard to LDTs. This means that even though the FDA believes it can impose regulatory requirements on LDTs, such as requirements to obtain premarket approval or clearance of LDTs, it has generally chosen not to enforce those requirements to date. Separately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services oversees clinical laboratory operations through the CLIA program.\nLegislative proposals addressing the FDA\u2019s oversight of LDTs have been previously introduced, and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. The likelihood that Congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the FDA\u2019s plans to regulate LDTs as medical devices, by either giving FDA explicit authority to do so or, alternatively, stating that FDA does not have authority to regulate LDTs, is difficult to predict. In March 2020, two bills were introduced in the Senate: the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development Act, or the VALID Act, which would expressly grant FDA authority to regulate LDTs under a risk-based framework; and the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories Act, or the VITAL Act, which would assign LDTs to regulation solely under CLIA and would direct CMS to update its CLIA regulations. Both the VALID Act and the VITAL Act were reintroduced in 2021. We cannot predict if either of these bills will be enacted in their current (or any other) form and cannot quantify the effect of these bills on our business. In the meantime, the regulation by the FDA of LDTs remains uncertain.\nIn August 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) announced that FDA will no longer require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking. In November 2021, HHS announced that this policy had been withdrawn after which the FDA resumed requiring submission of emergency use authorization (\u201cEUA\u201d) requests, for COVID-19 LDTs. The FDA has not indicated an intent to regulate other, non-COVID, LDTs, which suggests that the FDA\u2019s general policy of enforcement discretion remains in place. However, the FDA may, in the future, seek to actively regulate non-COVID LDTs, or Congress may act to provide further direction on the regulation of LDTs and substantially modify the regulation of IVDs.\nIn the meantime, the regulation by the FDA of our tests that are positioned as LDTs remains uncertain. If FDA premarket review or approval is required for any of the tests we are developing or may develop in the future as LDTs, we may be forced to stop selling our tests or be required to modify claims or make such other changes while we work to obtain FDA clearance, approval or de novo classification. Our business, results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected until such review were completed and clearance, approval or de novo classification to market were obtained.\nIf premarket clearance, approval, or de novo classification is required by the FDA or if we decide to voluntarily pursue FDA premarket clearance, approval or de novo classification of our future LDTs, there can be no assurance that any tests we develop in the future will be cleared, approved or classified on a timely basis, if at all. Obtaining FDA clearance, approval or de novo classification for diagnostics can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and for higher-risk devices generally takes\nseveral years and requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. In addition, medical devices are subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations for those tests would increase the cost of conducting our business and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we submitted to the FDA a Breakthrough Device designation request with respect to EndoCheck. While the FDA has demonstrated interest in continuing to work with us on EndoCheck, and while we plan to continue our discussions with the agency on Breakthrough Device Program designation, there is no assurance that the FDA will grant our request for EndoCheck to be designated as a Breakthrough Device.\nWe may not succeed in developing additional diagnostic products, and, even if we do succeed in developing additional diagnostic products, the diagnostic products may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to develop and commercialize diagnostic products. There is considerable risk in developing diagnostic products based on our biomarker discovery efforts, as candidate biomarkers may fail to demonstrate clinical validity in larger clinical studies or may not achieve acceptable levels of analytical accuracy. For example, markers being evaluated for one or more next-generation diagnostic tests may not be validated in downstream pre-clinical or clinical studies, once we undertake and perform such studies. In addition, development of products combining biomarkers with imaging, patient risk factors or other risk indicators carry higher than average risks due to technical, clinical and regulatory uncertainties. While we have published proof of concept on combining OVA1 and imaging, for example, our ability to develop, verify and validate an algorithm that generalizes to routine testing populations cannot be guaranteed. Also, outcomes of prospective and retrospective trials, for OVAWatch which are essential for clinical validation, are uncertain. In addition, our efforts to develop other diagnostic tests, such as EndoCheck, are in the discovery phase, and future pre-clinical or clinical studies may not support our early data. If successful, the regulatory pathway and clearance/approval process may require extensive discussion with applicable authorities and possibly medical panels or other oversight mechanisms. These pose considerable risk in projecting launch dates, requirements for clinical evidence and eventual pricing and return on investment. Although we are engaging important stakeholders representing gynecologic oncology, benign gynecology, patient advocacy, women\u2019s health research, legislators, payers, and others, success, timelines and value will be uncertain and require active management at all stages of innovation and development.\nClinical testing is expensive, takes many years to complete and can have an uncertain outcome. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing. Clinical trials for our next generation ovarian cancer tests, and other future diagnostic tests, may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or non-clinical testing on these tests. In addition, the results of our clinical trials may identify unexpected risks relative to safety or efficacy, which could complicate, delay or halt clinical trials, or result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nIf we do succeed in developing additional diagnostic tests with acceptable performance characteristics, we may not succeed in achieving commercial market acceptance for those tests. Our ability to successfully commercialize diagnostic products, including OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus, Aspira GenetiX and Aspira Synergy will depend on many factors, including:\n\uf0b7our ability to convince the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their advantages over existing diagnostic products;\n\uf0b7our success in establishing new clinical practices or changing previous ones, such that utilization of the tests fail to meet established standards of care, medical guidelines and the like;\n\uf0b7our ability to develop business relationships with diagnostic or laboratory companies that can assist in the commercialization of these products in the U.S. and globally; and\n\uf0b7the scope and extent of the agreement by Medicare and third-party payers to provide full or partial reimbursement coverage for our products, which will affect patients\u2019 willingness to pay for our products and will likely influence physicians\u2019 decisions to recommend or use our products.\nThese factors present obstacles to commercial acceptance of our existing and potential diagnostic products, for which we will have to spend substantial time and financial resources to overcome, and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. Our inability to do so successfully would prevent us from generating revenue from OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus, Aspira GenetiX and Aspira Synergy and developing future diagnostic products.\nThe diagnostics market is competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully, which would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue.\nOur principal competition currently comes from the many clinical options available to medical personnel involved in clinical decision making. For example, rather than ordering an OVA1, OVERA or OVA1plus test for a woman with an adnexal mass, obstetricians, gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists may choose a different clinical option or none at all. If we are not able to convince clinicians that these products provide significant improvement over current clinical practices, our ability to commercialize OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus will be adversely affected. Additionally, in September 2011, Fujirebio Diagnostics received FDA clearance for its ROMA test. ROMA combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm. ROMA is a competitive test with OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus that has adversely impacted and may continue to materially adversely impact our revenue. In addition, competitors, Becton Dickinson, Abbott Laboratories, AOA, Exact Sciences (Thrive), Grail, Anixa, Angle, InterVenn and others have publicly disclosed that they have been or are currently working on ovarian cancer diagnostic assays. Academic institutions periodically report new findings in ovarian cancer diagnostics that may have commercial value. Our failure to compete with any competitive diagnostic assay if and when commercialized could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have priced OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus at a point that recognizes the value-added by its increased sensitivity for detecting ovarian malignancy. If others develop a test that is viewed to be similar to any of these products in safety and efficacy but is priced at a lower point, we and/or our strategic partners may have to lower the price of that product in order to effectively compete, which would impact our margins and potential for profitability.\nOur diagnostic tests are subject to ongoing regulation by the FDA, and any delay by or failure of the FDA to authorize our diagnostic tests submitted to the FDA may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur activities related to diagnostic products are, or have the potential to be, subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the FDC Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of our products. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, civil money penalties, injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nThe FDC Act requires that medical devices introduced to the United States market, unless exempted by regulation, be authorized by FDA pursuant to either the premarket notification pathway, known as 510(k) clearance, the de novo classification pathway, or the PMA pathway. The FDA issued a de novo authorization for OVA1 in September 2009, and we commercially launched OVA1 in March 2010. In March 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for a second-generation biomarker panel known as OVA1 Next Generation, which we call OVERA. OVA1 was the first FDA-cleared blood test for the pre-operative assessment of ovarian masses. With respect to devices reviewed through the 510(k) process, we may not market a device until it is determined that our product is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device known as a predicate device. A 510(k) submission may involve the presentation of a substantial volume of data, including clinical data. The FDA may agree that the product is substantially equivalent to a predicate device and allow the product to be marketed in the United States. On the other hand, the FDA may determine that the device is not substantially equivalent and require a PMA or de novo classification, or require further information, such as additional test data, including data from clinical studies, before it is able to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. By requesting additional information, the FDA can delay market introduction of our products. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive any necessary 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA, or the imposition of stringent restrictions on the labeling and sales of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the FDA determines that a PMA is required for any of our potential future clinical products, the application will require extensive clinical studies, manufacturing information and could require review by an FDA advisory panel comprising experts outside the FDA. Clinical studies to support a 510(k) submission, de novo classification or a PMA application would need to be conducted in accordance with FDA requirements. Failure to comply with FDA requirements could result in the FDA\u2019s refusal to accept the submission or denial of the application. We cannot ensure that any necessary 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. To the extent we seek FDA 510(k) clearance, de novo classification or FDA pre-market approval for other diagnostic tests, any delay by or failure of the FDA to clear, classify, or approve those diagnostic tests may adversely affect our consolidated revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with FDA requirements for production, marketing and post-market monitoring of our products, we may not be able to market our products and services and may be subject to stringent penalties, product restrictions or recall.\nFailure to comply with FDA requirements for post-market monitoring of our products may affect the commercialization of our products, therefore adversely affecting our business. The FDA granted the request for de novo classification for OVA1 in September 2009 and cleared OVERA in March 2016. Post-market surveillance studies were conducted to further analyze performance of OVA1 and OVERA. These studies have been completed and closed with the FDA.\nAdditionally, the commercialization of our products could be delayed, halted or prevented by applicable FDA regulations. If the FDA were to view any of our actions as non-compliant, it could initiate enforcement actions, such as a warning letter and possible imposition of penalties. For instance, we are subject to a number of FDA requirements, including compliance with the FDA\u2019s QSR requirements, which establish extensive requirements for quality assurance and control as well as manufacturing procedures. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement actions for us or our potential suppliers. Adverse FDA actions in any of these areas could significantly increase our expenses and reduce our revenue. We will need to undertake steps to maintain our operations in line with the FDA\u2019s QSR requirements. Some components of OVA1 and OVERA are manufactured by other companies and we are required to ensure that, to the extent that we incorporate those components into our finished OVA1 and OVERA products (or OVA1plus, which is a reflex testing service in which both OVA1 and OVERA are used), we use those components in compliance with QSR. Any failure to do so would have an adverse effect on our ability to commercialize OVA1, OVERA or OVA1plus. Our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities, since they manufacture finished kits that we use in OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus, are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory agencies. Our facility also is subject to FDA inspection. We or our suppliers may not satisfy such regulatory requirements, and any such failure to do so may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our suppliers fail to produce acceptable or sufficient stock, fail to supply stock due to supply shortages, make changes to the design or labeling of their biomarker kits or discontinue production of existing biomarker kits or instrument platforms, we may be unable to meet market demand for OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus.\nThe commercialization of our OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus tests depend on the supply of seven different immunoassay kits from third-party manufacturers that run on automated instruments. Failure by any of these manufacturers to produce kits that meet our specifications and pass our quality control measures might lead to back-order and/or loss of revenue due to missed sales and customer dissatisfaction. In addition, if the design or labeling of any kit were to change, continued OVA1, OVERA or OVA1plus supply could be threatened since new validation and submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance could be required as a condition of sale. Discontinuation of any of these kits could require identification, validation and 510(k) submission of a revised OVA1, OVERA or OVA1plus design. Likewise, discontinuation or failure to support or service the instruments may pose risk to ongoing operations.\nChanges in healthcare policy could increase our costs and adversely impact sales of and reimbursement for our tests, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPAMA established a Medicare reimbursement system for clinical laboratories beginning in 2018 that is based on rates paid to laboratories by private payers. The CMS also issued various regulations and guidance to implement PAMA that require certain laboratories to report information the rates private payers pay them for laboratory tests, including Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses. In addition to these changes, a number of states are also contemplating significant reform of their healthcare reimbursement policies. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. Other changes to healthcare laws may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, the recycling and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment, and emissions and discharges into the environment. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs to remediate hazardous substances or petroleum products on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties affected by such contamination. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such substances could adversely affect the value and the ability to transfer or encumber such property.\nThe operation of ASPiRA LABS requires us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, which is expensive and time-consuming and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and any failure to comply could result in exposure to substantial penalties and other harm to our business.\nIn June 2014, we launched a clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS, in Texas. Clinical laboratories that perform tests on human subjects in the United States for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease or the assessment of human health must be certified under CLIA and licensed or permitted under applicable state laboratory laws. CLIA is a federal law that regulates the quality of clinical laboratory testing by requiring laboratories to comply with various technical, operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate, reliable and timely. A few states, including New York State may require that additional quality standards be met and that detailed review of scientific validations and technical procedures for tests occur. In the future, the federal government may change the way that clinical laboratory tests are regulated, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nASPiRA LABS holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license or permit in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. This allows the lab to perform OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus testing on a national basis. We are subject to periodic surveys and inspections to maintain our CLIA certification, and such certification is also required to obtain payment from Medicare, Medicaid and certain other third-party payers. Failure to comply with CLIA or state law requirements may result in the imposition of corrective action or the suspension or revocation of our CLIA certification or state licenses. If our CLIA certification or state licenses are suspended or revoked or our right to bill the Medicare and Medicaid programs or other third-party payers is suspended, we would no longer be able to sell our tests, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that ASPiRA LABS\u2019 suppliers or commercial partners will remain in compliance with applicable CLIA and other federal or state regulatory requirements for laboratory operations and testing. ASPiRA LABS\u2019 facilities and procedures and those of ASPiRA LABS\u2019 suppliers and commercial partners are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by regulatory and other government authorities. The principal sanction under CLIA is suspension, limitation or revocation of a lab\u2019s CLIA certificate. CMS also may impose the following alternative sanctions: (a) directed plan of correction, (b) state onsite monitoring, and/or (c) civil monetary penalty. In addition, the government may bring suit to enjoin any activity of any laboratory that has been found with deficiencies during a survey if CMS has reason to believe that continuation of the activity would constitute a significant hazard to the public health. Finally, criminal sanctions may be imposed on an individual who is convicted of intentionally violating any CLIA requirement.\nOur clinical laboratory business is also subject to regulation at both the federal and state level in the United States, as well as regulation in other jurisdictions outside of the United States, including:\n\uf0b7Medicare and Medicaid coverage, coding and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;\n\uf0b7the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (\u201cEKRA\u201d), and state anti-kickback prohibitions;\n\uf0b7the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and state self-referral prohibitions;\n\uf0b7the Medicare civil monetary penalty and exclusion requirements;\n\uf0b7the Federal False Claims Act civil and criminal penalties and state equivalents;\n\uf0b7the federal fraud, waste and abuse laws and state equivalents; and\n\uf0b7the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\u201cHITECH\u201d).\nMany of these laws and regulations prohibit a laboratory from making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests (by physicians or others) that are billed to Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs. The penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Several states have similar laws that may apply even in the absence of government payers. HIPAA and HITECH and similar state laws seek to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, and penalties for violations of these laws may include required reporting of breaches, monetary fines and criminal or civil penalties.\nIn 2020, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act and included a section called the \u201cNo Surprises Act.\u201d The No Surprises Act prohibits a health care provider from billing a commercially insured patient more than in-network cost-sharing amounts when a service originated from an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgery center, even if the provider is out-of-network with the patient\u2019s health plan. It also requires a provider to provide a good faith estimate of expected charges to an uninsured or self-pay patient upon the patient\u2019s request or when a patient schedules a service. Several states have similar laws that aim to protect patients from unexpected health care charges. Civil penalties of up to $10,000 per occurrence can be imposed for\nknowing violations of the No Surprises Act that are not remediated within a certain timeframe, and states may impose their own penalties for violations of their surprise billing laws.\nWhile we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and develop compliance policies to address risk as appropriate, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by governmental authorities or the courts. These laws or regulations also could in the future be interpreted or applied by governmental authorities or the courts in a manner that could require us to change our operations.\nAny action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations (including actions brought by private qui tam \u201cwhistleblower\u201d plaintiffs), even if successfully defended, could divert management\u2019s attention from our business, damage our reputation, limit our ability to provide services, decrease demand for our services and cause us to incur significant expenses for legal fees and damages. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, recoupment of funds received by us, exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business. We also could potentially incur additional liabilities from third-party claims. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have significant net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards as of December 31, 2021 for which a full valuation allowance has been provided due to our history of operating losses. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), as well as similar state provisions may restrict our ability to use our NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income due to ownership change limitations occurring in the past or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may also limit the amount of tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future tax liabilities.\nLegislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) was enacted on December 22, 2017. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, federal NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, and federal NOLs arising after January 1, 2018, are subject to different rules. The Company\u2019s pre- 2018 federal NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2022 through 2037, if not utilized\u037e and can offset 100% of future taxable income for regular tax purposes. Any federal NOLs arising after January 1, 2018, can generally be carried forward indefinitely and can offset up to 80% of future taxable income. State NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2022 through 2037 if not utilized. The Company\u2019s ability to use its NOLs during this period will be dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to generate taxable income, and the NOLs could expire before the Company generates sufficient taxable income.\nWe believe we have experienced ownership changes in the past for purposes of these limitations, and we estimate that a substantial portion of our existing federal NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitation. Additional issuances or sales of our common stock, or certain other transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control, could cause additional ownership changes. Any current or future limitation on the use of our NOLs or tax credit carryforwards could, depending on the extent of such limitation, result in our retaining less cash during any year in which we have taxable income than we would be entitled to retain if such limitations did not apply, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY\nIf we fail to maintain our rights to utilize intellectual property directed to diagnostic biomarkers, we may not be able to offer diagnostic tests using those biomarkers.\nOne aspect of our business plan is to develop diagnostic tests based on certain biomarkers, which we have the right to utilize through licenses with our academic collaborators, such as the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. In some cases, our collaborators own the entire right to the biomarkers. In other cases, we co-own the biomarkers with our collaborators. If, for some reason, we lose our license to biomarkers owned entirely by our collaborators, we may not be able to use those biomarkers in diagnostic tests. If we lose our exclusive license to biomarkers co-owned by us and our collaborators, our collaborators may license their share of the intellectual property to a third party that may compete with us in offering diagnostic tests, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf a third party infringes on our proprietary rights, we may lose any competitive advantage we have as a result of diversion of our time, enforcement costs and the loss of the exclusivity of our proprietary rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our technology and brand. We have submitted a number of patent applications covering biomarkers that may have diagnostic or therapeutic utility. Our patent applications may or may not result in additional patents being issued.\nIf third parties engage in activities that infringe on our proprietary rights, we may incur significant costs in asserting our rights, and the attention of our management may be diverted from our business. We may not be successful in asserting our proprietary patient rights, which could result in our patents being held invalid or a court holding that the competitor is not infringing, either of which may harm our competitive position. We cannot be sure that competitors will not design around our patented technology. We also may not be successful in asserting our proprietary trademark rights, which could result in significant rebranding costs, not being able to obtain a federal trademark registration, or a court holding that the competitor is not infringing, any of which may harm our competitive position. We cannot be sure that competitors will not use a similar mark.\nWe also rely upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our technical personnel. To help protect our rights, we require all employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, knowledge or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. If any trade secret, knowledge or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIf others successfully assert their proprietary rights against us, we may be precluded from making and selling our products or we may be required to obtain licenses to use their technology.\nOur success depends on avoiding infringing on the proprietary technologies of others. If a third party were to assert claims that we are violating its patents, we might incur substantial costs defending ourselves in lawsuits against charges of patent infringement or other allegations of unlawful use of another\u2019s proprietary technology. Any such lawsuit may involve considerable management and financial resources and may not be decided in our favor. If we are found liable, we may be subject to monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting us from using the technology. We may also be required to obtain licenses under patents owned by third parties and such licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIf a third party were to assert claims that we are violating its trademarks, we might incur substantial costs defending ourselves in lawsuits against charges of trademark infringement. Any such lawsuit may involve considerable management and financial resources and may not be decided in our favor. If we are found liable, we may be subject to monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting us from using the mark. We may also be required to rebrand or enter into a co-existence agreement with a third party, which may be commercially restrictive or unreasonable.\nOur diagnostic efforts may cause us to have significant product liability exposure.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic tests entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. We will need to increase our amount of insurance coverage in the future if we are successful at introducing new diagnostic products, and this will increase our costs. If we are held liable for a claim or for damages exceeding the limit of our insurance coverage, we may be required to make substantial payments. This may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING OUR STOCK\nThe liquidity and trading volume of our common stock may be low, and our ownership is concentrated.\nThe liquidity and trading volume of our common stock has at times been low in the past and may again be low in the future. If the liquidity and trading volume of our common stock is low, this could adversely impact the trading price of our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain liquidity in their shares of our common stock. Our stock issuances since May 2013 have primarily involved a significant issuance of stock to a limited number of investors, significantly increasing the concentration of our share ownership in a few holders.\nAccording to publicly available information, provided on Schedules 13D and 13G, as filed on July 6, 2020, December 30, 2021, January 13, 2022, February 14, 2022 and February 16, 2022, we estimate that a total of five persons beneficially own approximately 47.98% of our outstanding common stock. Under the May 2013 stockholders agreement, two of our stockholders have the right to designate a director to be nominated by us to serve on our Board of Directors, and one of these persons has exercised this right. As a result, these stockholders will be able to affect the outcome of, or exert significant influence over, all\nmatters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control involving us. In addition, this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership also contributes to the low trading volume and volatility of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, the closing trading price of our common stock ranged from a high of $9.13 per share to a low of $1.63 per share. The trading price of our common stock could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\uf0b7failure to significantly increase revenue and volumes of OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus, Aspira GenetiX or Aspira Synergy;\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated period-to-period fluctuations in financial results;\n\uf0b7failure to achieve, or changes in, financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\uf0b7announcements or introductions of new products or services or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7failure to complete clinical studies that validate clinical utility sufficiently to increase positive medical policy among payers at large;\n\uf0b7publicity regarding actual or potential discoveries of biomarkers by others;\n\uf0b7comments or opinions by securities analysts or stockholders;\n\uf0b7the inclusion of our common stock in stock market indices such as the Russell 3000 Index;\n\uf0b7conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or life science industries;\n\uf0b7announcements by us of significant acquisitions and divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\uf0b7developments regarding our patents or other intellectual property or that of our competitors;\n\uf0b7litigation or threat of litigation;\n\uf0b7additions or departures of key personnel;\n\uf0b7limited daily trading volume;\n\uf0b7economic and other external factors, disasters or crises; and\n\uf0b7our announcement of future fundraisings.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for diagnostic technology companies, in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of our attention and our resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter, bylaws, other agreements and under Delaware law could make a third-party acquisition of the Company difficult.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us, even if a change of control might be deemed beneficial to our stockholders. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our securities. Our certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders or to act by written consent without a meeting, and our bylaws require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations, which may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before an annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at an annual meeting of stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock. In addition, the likelihood that the holders of preferred stock will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.\nIn connection with our private placement offering of common stock and warrants in May 2013, we entered into a stockholders agreement which, among other things, includes agreements limiting our ability to effect a change in control without\nthe consent of at least one of the two primary investors in that offering. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of us. The amendment of any of the provisions of either our certificate of incorporation or bylaws described in the preceding paragraph would require not only approval by our board of directors and the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of our then outstanding voting securities, but also the consent of at least one of the two primary investors in the May 2013 offering. We are also subject to certain provisions of Delaware law that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company. These provisions could make a third-party acquisition of the Company difficult and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, our stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nWe may need to sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities in the future to meet our capital requirements, which could cause significant dilution.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of the issuance of common stock in public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements, grants and government funding and strategic alliances. As discussed in \u201cRisks Related to our Business and Industry,\u201d our management believes the successful achievement of our business objectives will require additional financing through one of these avenues. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt, such financing may be dilutive to stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and potential dilution to stockholders. Furthermore, a perception that future sales of our common stock in the public market are likely to occur could affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock.\nAs of March 18, 2022, we had 112,138,741 shares of our common stock outstanding and 3,729,204 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance to employees, directors and consultants pursuant to our employee stock plans, which excludes 10,257,908 shares of our common stock that were subject to outstanding options.\nThe exercise of all or a portion of our outstanding options will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nGENERAL RISKS\nBecause our business is highly dependent on key executives and employees, our inability to recruit and retain these people could hinder our business plans.\nWe are highly dependent on our executive officers and certain key employees. Our executive officers and key employees are employed at will by us. Any inability to engage new executive officers or key employees could impact operations or delay or curtail our research, development and commercialization objectives. To continue our research and product development efforts, we need people skilled in areas such as clinical operations, regulatory affairs and clinical diagnostics. Competition for qualified employees is intense. To continue our commercialization objectives and reach our financial and operational goals, we require skilled sales individuals with familiarity in our industry. We have from time to time experienced, and may in the future experience, shortages of certain types of qualified employees.\nIf we lose the services of any executive officers or key employees, our ability to achieve our business objectives could be harmed, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have and may continue to experience turnover in certain executive officer and key employee roles.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nWe may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities in the public or private markets, or through a collaborative arrangement or sale of assets. Additional financing opportunities may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on favorable terms. The availability of financing opportunities will depend, in part, on market conditions, and the outlook for our business. Any future issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, and the securities issued in such a financing may have rights, preferences or privileges\nsenior to those of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to continue our sales and marketing, research and development, distribution or other operations on the scope or scale of our current activity.\nBusiness interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur operations, as well as those of the collaborators on which we depend, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire; natural disasters, including earthquakes, weather related supply chain delivery disruptions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, human error, power shortages, telecommunication failures, international acts of terror, epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, and other similar events. Although we have certain business continuity plans in place, we have not established a formal comprehensive disaster recovery plan, and our back-up operations and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses we may suffer. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations.\nThe operation of ASPiRA LABS and our Aspira Synergy business depends on the effectiveness and availability of our information systems, including the information systems we use to provide services to our customers and to store employee data, and failures of these systems, including in connection with cyber-attacks, may materially limit our operations or have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nThe information systems we use for our ASPiRA LABS business are comprised of systems we have purchased or developed, our legacy information systems and, increasingly, web-enabled and other integrated information systems. In using these information systems, we may rely on third-party vendors to provide hosting services, where our infrastructure is dependent upon the reliability of their underlying platforms, facilities and communications systems. We also plan to utilize integrated information systems that we provide customers access to or install for our customers in conjunction with our delivery of services. The addition of our decentralized technology transfer business may also be affected by these information systems.\nAs the breadth and complexity of ASPiRA LABS\u2019 information system grows, we will be increasingly exposed to the risks inherent in maintaining the stability of our legacy systems due to prior customization, attrition of employees or vendors involved in their development, and obsolescence of the underlying technology as well as risks from the increasing number and scope of external data breaches on companies generally. Because certain customers and clinical trials may be dependent upon these legacy systems, we will also face an increased level of embedded risk in maintaining the legacy systems and limited options to mitigate such risk. We are also exposed to risks associated with the availability of all of our information systems, including:\n\uf0b7disruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms, including those maintained by third-party vendors;\n\uf0b7security breaches of, cyber-attacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our internal systems, including our employee data and communications, critical application systems and their associated hardware; and\n\uf0b7excessive costs, excessive delays and other deficiencies in systems development and deployment.\nThe materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data, the delivery of databases and services, and the day-to-day management of our ASPiRA LABS business and could result in the corruption, loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential or other data. While we have invested and continue to invest in disaster recovery plans, security initiatives, and risk management in line with applicable regulations and industry standards, they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure, cyber-attack, cyber-breach, data breach or other adverse event. Despite any precautions we take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, the outbreak or escalation of war, acts of terrorism, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our various computer facilities or those of our third-party vendors could result in interruptions in the flow of data to us and from us to our customers. Corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a trial at no cost to the customer, but at significant cost to us, the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation. As our business continues its efforts to expand globally, these types of risks may be further increased by instability in the geopolitical climate of certain regions, underdeveloped and less stable utilities and communications infrastructure, and other local and regional factors. Additionally, significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems could damage our reputation and harm our business. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance which we believe is customary for our industry, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data, whether through systems failure or employee or distributor negligence, cyber-attacks, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and, to the extent any such unauthorized disclosure compromises the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, could also cause us to face sanctions and fines under the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. Similarly, we have been and expect that we will continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we internally or externally develop for our customers, including a cyber-attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and\ndeploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, process breakdowns, denial-of-service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. These concerns about security are increased when information is transmitted over the Internet. Threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, and any of these could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties, equipment and data. They could also compromise data security. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. These same risks also apply to ASPiRA LABS. Successful attacks could result in negative publicity, significant remediation and recovery costs, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses, products or technologies. We may not be successful in integrating other businesses, products or technologies with our business. Any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe selectively explore and may pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. The market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive, which could make it difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities. If we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment, financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders, whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock.\nThe process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation. We may not successfully achieve the integration objectives, and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and synergies in full or at all, or it may take longer to realize them than expected, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture litigation by or against us could be costly and time-consuming to prosecute or defend.\nWe are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by current or former employees, and claims brought by third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. In addition, we may bring claims against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert our attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay monetary damages. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 88620, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "AWH"}
