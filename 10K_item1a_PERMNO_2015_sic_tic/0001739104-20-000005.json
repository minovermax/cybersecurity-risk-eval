{"cik": "1739104", "company": "Elanco Animal Health Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including but not limited to the risks described below. If any of such risks actually materializes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Elanco\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive.\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include standalone animal health businesses, the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies, specialty animal health businesses and companies that mainly produce generic products. We believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Several new start-up companies also compete in the animal health industry. We also face competition from manufacturers of drugs globally, as well as producers of nutritional health products. These competitors may have access to greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources. As a result, they may be able to devote more resources to developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling their products, initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities. Further, consolidation in the animal health industry could result in existing competitors realizing additional efficiencies or improving portfolio bundling opportunities, thereby potentially increasing their market share and pricing power, which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and profitability and an increase in competition. For example, many of our competitors have relationships with key distributors and, because of their size, the ability to offer attractive pricing incentives, which may negatively impact or hinder our relationships with these distributors. In addition to competition from established market participants, new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry could substantially reduce our market share, render our products obsolete or disrupt our business model.\nTo the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, or we are forced to reduce, or are unable to raise, the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Competitive pressure could arise from, among other things, more favorable safety and efficacy product profiles, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular market, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale, the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise procure animal health products at lower costs than us and the ability of competitors to access more or newer technology than us.\nDisruptive innovation and advances in veterinary medical practices, animal health technologies and alternatives to animal-derived protein, could negatively affect the market for our products.\nThe markets for our products are regularly impacted by the introduction and/or broad market acceptance of newly-developed or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products, including \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cholistic\u201d health products, specially bred disease-resistant animals or replacements for meat, milk, eggs or fish from alternative natural or synthetic sources. For example, the market for our companion animal therapeutics has been particularly affected by innovation in new molecules and delivery formulations in recent years. Technological breakthroughs by others may render obsolete our products and reduce or eliminate the market for our products. Introduction or acceptance of competing animal health products and innovation or disruptive protein alternatives could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory restrictions and bans on the use of antibiotics and productivity products in food animals, as well as changing market demand, may continue to negatively affect demand for certain of our food animal products.\nOver the past few years, our operational results have been, and will continue to be, affected by regulations and changing market demand. In certain markets, including the U.S., sales of certain of our food animal products have been negatively affected by an increase in consumer sentiment for proteins and dairy products produced without the use of antibiotics or other products intended to increase animal production.\nThere are two classes of antibiotics used in animal health: shared-class, or medically important, antibiotics, which are used to treat infectious disease caused by pathogens that occur in both humans and animals; and animal-only antibiotics, which are used to treat infectious disease caused by pathogens that occur in animals only. See \u201cBusiness of Elanco - Products - Antibiotics.\u201d Concerns that the use of antibiotics in food animal production may lead to increased antibiotic resistance of human pathogens have resulted in increased regulation and changing market demand. In December 2013, the FDA announced final guidance establishing procedures for the voluntary phase-out in the U.S. over a three-year period of the use of shared-class antibiotics in animal feed or water for growth promotion in food animal production. The guidance allows for continued use of shared-class antibiotics in food-producing animals under the supervision of a veterinarian for treatment, control and, under certain circumstances, for prevention of disease. The FDA indicated that it took this action to help preserve the efficacy of shared-class antibiotics to treat infections in humans. As part of those efforts, stricter guidelines governing the administration of shared-class antibiotics have recently come into effect. As of January 1, 2017, under the FDA\u2019s guidance and the related rule known as the Veterinary Feed Directive, the use of shared-class antibiotics in the water or feed of food-producing animals requires written authorization by a licensed veterinarian. In addition, other countries in which we sell or plan to sell our products, such as France and Vietnam, have passed restrictions or bans on antibiotic use. Other countries have placed restrictions or bans on the use of specific antibiotics in certain food-producing animals, regardless of the route of administration (in feed or injectable).\nFrom 2015 to 2019, our revenue from shared-class antibiotics declined at a CAGR of 10%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. This was driven primarily by changing regulations in many markets, including the Veterinary Feed Directive, as well as changing market demand and our tiered approach to antibiotic stewardship, which included removing growth promotion from labels and requiring veterinary oversight in the U.S. and other markets. Globally, during 2019, our revenue from shared-class antibiotics declined 13%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, and represented 11% (4% from sales in the U.S. and 7% from sales outside the U.S.) of total revenue, down from 16% in 2015. From 2015 to 2019, our revenue from animal-only antibiotics grew at a CAGR of 4%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, driven by sales outside the U.S., which offset a slight decline in the U.S. Globally, during 2019, our revenue from animal-only antibiotics declined 1%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, and represented 24% of total revenue, up from 23% in 2015. In 2019, 87% of our revenue from animal-only antibiotics resulted from the sale of ionophores. Ionophores are a special class of animal-only antimicrobials, and because of their animal-only designation, mode of action and spectrum of activity, their use has not to date been impacted by regulations or changing market demand in many markets outside of the U.S.\nThe impact of changes in regulations and market preferences regarding the use of antibiotics in food animals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If there is an increased public perception that consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products poses a risk to human health, there may be a further decline in the production of those food products and, in turn, demand for our products. In addition, antibiotic resistance concerns will likely result in additional restrictions or bans, expanded regulations or public pressure to further reduce the use of antibiotics in food animals, increased demand for antibiotic-free protein, or changes in the market acceptance or regulatory treatment of ionophores, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our revenue has been impacted by regulatory changes in China and other markets restricting the use of productivity products, such as those containing ractopamine, in food animals. This has resulted in many U.S. food producers who access such markets eliminating their use of ractopamine. Our FA Ruminants & Swine products Optaflexx\u2122 and Paylean\u2122 contain ractopamine. If more producers decide to access such markets or additional markets restrict the use of ractopamine or other productivity products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneric products may be viewed as more cost-effective than our products.\nWe face competition from products produced by other companies, including generic alternatives to our products. We depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products. Patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the jurisdictions where such patents are obtained. The extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents, the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable jurisdiction. In 2019, approximately 67% of our revenue was from products that did not have patent protection, including revenue from some of our top products such as Rumensin, Maxiban, Denagard and Tylan Premix. Other products are protected by patents that expire over the next several years. As the\npatents for a brand name product expire, competitors may begin to introduce generic or other alternatives, and as a result, we may face competition from lower-priced alternatives to many of our products. For example, we have experienced significant competitive headwinds from generic ractopamine in the U.S. In the third quarter of 2013, a large established animal health company received U.S. approval for generic ractopamine. U.S. revenue from Optaflexx, our ractopamine beef product, has declined at a compound annual growth rate of 21% from 2015 to 2019 as a result of generic competition and international regulatory restrictions. In the third quarter of 2019, an established animal health company received U.S. approval for generic monensin in cattle and goats for certain indications. U.S. revenue from Rumensin, our monensin product, may continue to decline as a result of the generic competition. We may face similar competition in the future for existing products that do not benefit from exclusivity or for existing products with material patents expiring in the future. See \u201cBusiness of Elanco - Intellectual Property.\u201d\nGeneric competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching products before patent rights expire, and, because of attractive pricing, sales of generic products are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions. Although the impact of generic competition in the animal health industry to date has not typically mirrored that seen in human health, product pricing and the impact of generic competition in the future may more closely mirror human health as a result of changes in industry dynamics, such as channel expansion, consolidation, an increase in the availability and use of pet insurance and the potential for generic competition by established animal health businesses. If animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully implement our business strategies or achieve targeted cost efficiencies and gross margin improvements.\nWe are pursuing strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our long-term success, including, but not limited to: improving manufacturing processes, reducing our manufacturing footprint, achieving lean initiatives, consolidating our CMO network, strategically insourcing projects, pursuing cost savings opportunities with respect to raw materials through a new procurement process and improving the productivity of our sales force. We may pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future to improve gross margins and achieve our targeted cost efficiencies. We also have acquired or partnered with a number of smaller animal health businesses, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we may not succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives. Realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all, may take several years. We may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in strategic initiatives, or our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.\nConsolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nThird-party distributors, veterinarians and food animal producers are our primary customers. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals. In addition, food animal producers, particularly swine and poultry producers, and our distributors have seen recent consolidation in their industries. Furthermore, we have seen the expansion of larger cross-border corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups (cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers). The pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies. If these trends towards consolidation continue, our customers could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing. The resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA general outbreak of infectious disease or viruses or an outbreak of infectious disease carried by food animals could negatively affect the demand for, and sale and production of, our food animal products.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, in December 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has resulted in travel disruption globally and has affected certain companies' operations in China and other countries, including companies with which we do business. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain.\nSales of our food animal products could be materially adversely affected by a general outbreak of infectious disease or an outbreak of disease carried by food animals, which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of food animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein. In addition, outbreaks of disease carried by food animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our food animal products due to reduced herd or flock sizes.\nIn recent years, outbreaks of various diseases, including African Swine Fever, avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (otherwise known as BSE or \u201cmad cow\u201d disease) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (otherwise known as PEDV) have negatively impacted sales of our animal health products. The discovery of additional cases of any of these, or new, diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal protein, reduced herd or flock sizes, or reduced demand for animal protein, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere.\nOur R&D, acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products.\nOur future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition, including the acquisition of the Bayer animal health business (see Note 6: Acquisitions to our consolidated and combined financial statements). We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.\nWe may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched, or we may be unable to develop, license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products. In addition, we cannot predict whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations. The animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and, as a result, products that are successful in some markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into other markets. Furthermore, the timing and cost of our R&D may increase, and our R&D may become less predictable as, among other things, regulations applicable to our industry may make it more time-consuming and/or costly to research, develop and register products. If we are unable to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. For example, between 2015 and 2017, prior to our February 2018 launch of Credelio in the U.S., we experienced an innovation lag in the companion animal parasiticide space. In the absence of a competitive combined oral flea and tick product, our U.S. companion animal parasiticide portfolio revenue declined 15% in 2017, excluding the impact on revenue resulting from a reduction in inventory levels within our distribution channel.\nIn addition, some of our growth occurred through Lilly\u2019s acquisitions, including Novartis Animal Health, Lohmann Animal Health, Janssen Animal Health and the BI Vetmedica U.S. vaccines portfolio. However, following the Separation, we no longer benefit from Lilly\u2019s scale, capital base and financial strength.\nWe had losses in recent periods.\nWe have incurred net losses in recent periods. We could continue to incur asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges and could report losses in the future. We also expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures to develop, manufacture and market our products and implement our business strategies, transaction costs and integration expenses associated with acquisitions, additional amortization of intangible assets, and interest expense. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, adverse events and other unknown factors that may materially adversely affect our business.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.\nOur products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species. There may be increased risk of product liability claims if veterinarians, food animal producers, pet owners or others attempt to use our products off-label, including the use of our products in species\n(including humans) for which they have not been approved. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those for which our products have been approved may not be effective, which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation. If we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for off-label use, such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices, and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnimal health products are subject to unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns, which may harm our reputation.\nUnanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns arise from time to time with respect to animal health products, whether or not scientifically or clinically supported, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or suspended or declining sales, as well as product liability and other claims.\nRegulatory actions based on these types of safety, quality or efficacy concerns could impact all, or a significant portion, of a product\u2019s sales and could, depending on the circumstances, materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety, quality and efficacy of our products, and animal health products generally, by food producers, veterinarians and pet owners, any concern as to the safety, quality or efficacy of our products, whether actual or perceived, may harm our reputation. These concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether such reports are accurate.\nOur business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources.\nThe animal health industry and demand for many of our products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions, varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from pests, such as ticks. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nFood animal producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including large supplies of fresh water. Their animals\u2019 health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. In the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water, veterinarians or food animal producers may purchase less of our products.\nFurther, heat waves may cause stress in animals and lead to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced fertility rates and reduced milk production. Droughts may threaten pasture and feed supplies by reducing the quality and amount of forage available to grazing livestock, while climate change may increase the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect food animals. Adverse weather conditions may also have a material impact on the aquaculture business. Changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species, as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases.\nIn addition, veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from, and access to, the animals under their care. Veterinarians\u2019 patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow, ice or other severe weather conditions, particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather.\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets, including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe have taken steps to increase our presence in select emerging markets, including by expanding our sales organization and product offerings in these markets. The acquisition of the Bayer animal health business is expected to further increase our presence in emerging markets (see Note 6: Acquisitions to our consolidated and combined financial statements). Failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, certain emerging markets have legal systems that are less developed. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may have legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from U.S. laws and regulations, are continuously evolving or do not include sufficient judicial or administrative guidance to interpret such laws and regulations. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations or possible violations of applicable laws or regulations by our employees may result in investigation costs, potential penalties and other related costs, which in turn could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations.\nSome countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local, regional or global economic, political or social instability or crisis. For example, our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters. Furthermore, we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local, regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries. In addition, certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially, which may impact our financial performance. For these reasons, among others, doing business within emerging markets carries significant risks.\nModification of foreign trade policy may harm our food animal product customers.\nChanges in laws, agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers\u2019 businesses and adversely affect our results of operations. A number of our customers, particularly U.S.-based food animal producers, benefit from free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In November 2018, the U.S. negotiated a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico known as the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA), aimed at re-negotiating and updating the terms of NAFTA. The USMCA was revised by the parties on December 10, 2019. The USMCA still requires ratification by Canada before it can take effect. If the USMCA is not ratified and the U.S. were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or other international trade agreements to which it is a party or if the U.S. were to engage in trade disputes or the imposition of tariffs, our customers could be harmed, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions.\nMacroeconomic business and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face constraints on the availability of credit or decreased cash flow that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from our customers. If one or more of our large customers, including distributors, discontinues or modifies their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or to continue to own a pet. Furthermore, our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. Our procedures intended to monitor and limit our exposure to credit and collectability risk may not effectively limit such risk and avoid losses.\nOur results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top products.\nIf any of our top products experience issues, such as disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective competitive products, negative publicity, changes to veterinarian or customer preferences, loss of patent protection, material product liability litigation, new or unexpected side effects, manufacturing disruptions and/or regulatory proceedings, our revenue could be negatively impacted, perhaps significantly. Our top five products, Rumensin, Trifexis, Maxiban, Denagard and Interceptor Plus, contributed approximately 31% of our revenue in 2019. Any issues with these top products, particularly Rumensin, which contributed approximately 10% of our revenue in 2019 and is now subject to generic competition in the U.S., could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income.\nFeed, fuel, transportation and other key costs for food animal producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease. Either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our food animal product customers, potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered. Our food animal product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our food animal products, including by switching to lower-cost alternatives to our products. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lower-cost alternatives to our products, which could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products, especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership. Rising costs or reduced income for our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor our companion animal products, increased use of alternative distribution channels, or changes within existing distribution channels, could negatively impact our market share, margins and distribution of our products.\nIn most markets, pet owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. However, pet owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as online retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. This trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years. Pet owners also could decrease their reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians as they rely more on internet-based animal health information. Because we market our companion animal prescription products primarily through the veterinarian distribution channel, any decrease in visits to veterinarians by pet owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, pet owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.\nLegislation has also been proposed in the U.S., and may be proposed in the U.S. or abroad in the future, that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products. For example, such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party, which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. Such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our companion animal products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives. Many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the American Veterinary Medical Association has long-standing policies in place to encourage this practice.\nOver time, these and other competitive conditions may increase our use of online retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products. We may not be adequately prepared or able to distribute our companion animal products if an increased portion of our sales occur through these channels. Also, we may realize lower margins on sales through these distribution channels than we do on sales through veterinarians. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if one or more of our companion animal distributors discontinues or modifies their relationship with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. For example, in 2017, a change in our U.S. inventory management practices resulted in a revenue lag as existing inventory was sold down, which management estimates decreased our revenue by approximately $35 million.\nSupply chain continuity could be disrupted by a major catastrophic event or third party quality issue causing a loss of inventory and/or facility that could negatively impact the amount of product sold.\nIn our business, we have multiple warehouses in the supply chain that have a material amount of inventory. This could create excessive risk if a catastrophic event were to occur at one of these locations. As such, business continuity plans are critical to our manufacturing sites. Additionally, our contracts require that all CMOs and suppliers have business continuity plans. If business continuity plans are not in place, it could result in disruptions in our supply chain. While we work with our CMOs and suppliers to ensure continuity, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. In addition, due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of CMOs and suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement CMOs or suppliers on a timely basis or without\nexcessive cost. The termination, reduction or interruption in our supply chain could adversely impact our ability to produce and sell certain of our products.\nIncreased or decreased inventory levels at our channel distributors can lead to fluctuations in our revenues and variations in payment terms extended to our distributors can impact our cash flows.\nIn addition to selling our products directly to veterinarians, we sell to distributors who, in turn, sell our products to third parties. Inventory levels at our distributors may increase or decrease as a result of various factors, including end customer demand, new customer contracts, heightened and generic competition, required minimum inventory levels, our ability to renew distribution contracts with expected terms, our ability to implement commercial strategies, regulatory restrictions, unexpected customer behavior, and procedures and environmental factors beyond our control, including weather conditions or an outbreak of infectious disease carried by food animals such as African Swine Fever. These increases and decreases can lead to variations in our quarterly and annual revenues. In addition, like all companies that manufacture and sell products, we have policies that govern the payment terms that we extend to our customers. Due to consolidation amongst our distributors, as well as changes in the buying habits of end customers or the need for certain inventory levels at our distributors to avoid supply disruptions, from time to time, our distributors have requested exceptions to the payment term policies that we extend to them. Extensions of customer payment terms can impact our cash flows, liquidity and results of operations.\nLoss of our executive officers or other key personnel could disrupt our operations.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. Our executive officers and other key personnel are not currently, and are not expected to be, subject to non-compete provisions. In addition, we have not entered into employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets and record a non-cash impairment charge. As of December 31, 2019, we had recorded on our balance sheet goodwill of $3.0 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $2.5 billion. Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of marketed products acquired or licensed from third parties, licensed platform technologies that have alternative future uses in R&D, manufacturing technologies, and customer relationships from business combinations. We also have indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of acquired in-process R&D projects from business combinations that are subject to impairment and non-cash impairment charges.\nDetermining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. Future events or new information may change management\u2019s valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time. The timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of operations and write-downs recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if our management\u2019s conclusions change. Any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a standalone public company, we may expend additional time and resources to comply with rules and regulations that did not previously apply to us, and failure to comply with such rules may lead investors to lose confidence in our financial data.\nAs a standalone public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and regulations of the NYSE. Previously, we had established all of the procedures and practices required as a subsidiary of Lilly, but we must continue to implement others as a separate, standalone public company. Continuing to establish and expand such procedures and practices could increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, will make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and could be burdensome on our personnel, systems and resources. We have devoted and are continuing to devote resources to address these public company\nrequirements. As a result, we have and will continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur while a subsidiary of Lilly to comply with these rules and regulations. Furthermore, continuing the need to establish the corporate infrastructure necessary for a standalone public company may divert some of our management\u2019s attention from operating our business and implementing our strategy. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements.\nOur R&D relies on evaluations of animals, which may become subject to bans, additional restrictive regulations or increased attention from activism movements.\nAs an animal health medicines and vaccines business, we are required to evaluate the effect of our existing and new products in animals in order to register such products. Animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of new regulations applicable to animal testing. To the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful, our R&D, and by extension our business, financial condition and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation. For example, food animal producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights, nutrition, health-related or other concerns. Any reputational harm to the food animal industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including our company. Adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in food animals also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nManufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls or unanticipated costs.\nIn order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship sufficient quantities to our customers. We own and operate 12 internal manufacturing sites located in nine countries. We also employ a network of approximately 90 third-party CMOs. Many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites.\nMinor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result, and have in the past resulted in, delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. In addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions, including:\n\u2022the failure of us or any of our vendors or suppliers, including logistical service providers, to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines;\n\u2022mislabeling;\n\u2022construction delays;\n\u2022equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022shortages of materials;\n\u2022labor problems;\n\u2022natural disasters;\n\u2022power outages;\n\u2022criminal and terrorist activities;\n\u2022changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, shipping distributions or physical limitations; and\n\u2022the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near our production sites.\nThese interruptions could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. The unpredictability of a product\u2019s regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites and shifting customer demand (including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition) increase the potential for capacity imbalances. In addition, construction of sites is expensive, and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites, which is uncertain.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply.\nThe materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other factors. In addition, labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor, governmental regulations, economic climate and other factors. Increases in the demand for, availability or the price of, materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products, result in product delivery delays or shortages, and impact our ability to launch new products on a timely basis or at all. We may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our third-party suppliers cease or interrupt operations, fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us.\nWe may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters. If the acquisition of the Bayer animal health business is consummated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be materially adversely affected by pending or future litigation matters affecting the Bayer animal health business. These matters may include, among other things, allegations of violation of U.S. and foreign competition law, labor laws, consumer protection laws and environmental laws and regulations, as well as claims or litigation relating to product liability, intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. In addition, changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject, or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase our exposure to liability. For example, in the U.S., attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of, or injury to, a companion animal. If such attempts were successful, our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially.\nLitigation matters, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, are costly, divert management\u2019s attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters. An adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in us being responsible for significant damages. Any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to substantial regulation.\nAs a global company, we are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations, including regulations relating to the development, quality assurance, manufacturing, importation, distribution, marketing and sale of our products. Changes in applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our manufacturing facilities, including the manufacturing facilities operated by our CMOs, are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies. An inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements. Our failure, or the failure of third parties we rely on, including CMOs, to comply with these regulatory requirements, allegations of such non-compliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in, among other things, inspection observation notices, warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence, fines, a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated, withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market, and civil or criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims. Any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products. Even after a product reaches market, we may be subject to re-review and may lose our approvals. Our failure to obtain approvals, delays in the approval process, or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction, may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or re-approval is obtained, if ever.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen, diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development, manufacturing and distribution processes. Counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening to animals. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent and/or which are sold under our brand name. In addition, products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory, warehouses, plants or while in transit, which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact animal health and safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting, illegal compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. Due to our operations, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions.\nGiven the nature of our business, we have incurred, are currently incurring and may in the future incur liabilities for the investigation and remediation of contaminated land under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or under other federal, state, local and foreign environmental cleanup laws, with respect to our current or former sites, adjacent or nearby third-party sites, or offsite disposal locations. We could be subject to liability for the investigation and remediation of legacy environmental contamination caused by historical industrial activity as sites that we own or on which we operate. The costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material. Additionally, we may become liable to third parties for damages, including personal injury, property damage and natural resource damages, resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment. Such liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and food animal operations on the environment. This increased regulatory scrutiny has in the past and may in the future necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products.\nOur failure to comply with the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject, including any permits issued thereunder, may result in environmental remediation costs, loss of permits, fines, penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials, environmental damage or significant environmental, health and safety issues that might arise at a manufacturing or R&D facility. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation. It is possible that our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising\nfrom past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business.\nA third party may sue us, or our distributors or licensors, including Lilly, or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of such third-party\u2019s patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights. If our distributors, licensors or we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to:\n\u2022pay monetary damages;\n\u2022obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u2022stop activities, including any commercial activities, relating to the affected products, which could include a recall of the affected products and/or a cessation of sales in the future.\nThe costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, even if we successfully defend such claim. Moreover, even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing third-party patent, we may choose to license such patent, which would result in associated costs and obligations. We may also incur costs in connection with an obligation to indemnify a distributor, licensor or other third party.\nThe intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, and an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or develop, manufacture or commercialize the patented product. For example, while we generally enter into proprietary information agreements with our employees and third parties, which assign intellectual property rights to us, these agreements may not be honored or may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us under the local laws of some countries or jurisdictions. We cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing, developing or marketing certain of our products, regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would otherwise be able to develop a more commercially successful product, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented, competitors may be able to take advantage of our R&D efforts or harm the value of our brands.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to market innovative, competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours.\nOur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be approved on a timely basis, if at all. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents, or any patents that may issue in the future, may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area.\nThe validity and scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have their own patent laws. For example, some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself, and its first use, and thus further methods of use for the same compound may not be patentable. The validity, enforceability, scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that vary based on the local law of the relevant jurisdiction. Our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country\u2019s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights. Patent protection must be obtained on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and we only pursue patent protection in countries where we think it makes commercial sense for the given product. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which\nthird parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements terminate, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPatent law reform in the U.S. and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights, or make such enforcement financially unattractive. For instance, in September 2011, the U.S. enacted the America Invents Act, which permits enhanced third-party actions for challenging patents and implements a first-to-invent system. These reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products in these jurisdictions. Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur trademarks and brands may provide us with a competitive advantage in the market as they may be known or trusted by consumers. In order to maintain the value of such brands, we must be able to enforce and defend our trademarks. We have pursued and will pursue the registration of trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally; however, enforcing rights against those who knowingly or unknowingly dilute or infringe our brands can be difficult. Effective trademark, service mark, trade dress or related protections may not be available in every country in which our products and services are available. Enforcement is especially difficult in first-to-file countries where \u201ctrademark squatters\u201d can prevent us from obtaining adequate protections for our brands. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken and will take to protect our proprietary rights in our brands and trademarks will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe, dilute or misappropriate our brands, trademarks, trade dress or other similar proprietary rights.\nMany of our products are based on or incorporate proprietary information. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by generally requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. The U.S. recently enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising U.S. tax law, and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes. Other organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission, are also actively considering tax related matters, which could influence international tax policy in countries in which we operate. While outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain, modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u2018\u20182017 Tax Act\u2019\u2019). The 2017 Tax Act included significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, such as the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, transition to a modified territorial tax system, changes to business related exclusions, deductions and credits, and modifications to international tax provisions. The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS began to issue major proposed regulations related to the 2017 Tax Act during 2018 and are expected to continue issuing proposed and final regulations. Proposed regulations are generally subject to comment before being finalized; however, once finalized, these regulations may require Elanco to make adjustments, in particular, as a result of certain complex international provisions contained in the 2017 Tax Act. Such adjustments might materially impact Elanco\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made and could also impact Elanco\u2019s net income, earnings per share, consolidated cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and tax liability. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or other material foreign jurisdictions, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSignificant portions of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions, including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption, and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.\nOur international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following:\n\u2022volatility in the international financial markets;\n\u2022compliance with governmental controls;\n\u2022difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022parallel trade in our products (importation of our products from EU countries where our products are sold at lower prices into EU countries where the products are sold at higher prices);\n\u2022compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022compliance with foreign labor laws;\n\u2022burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, health and safety requirements;\n\u2022changes in laws, regulations, government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our customers, including the imposition of limits on our profitability;\n\u2022political and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities and armed conflicts;\n\u2022trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities, including restrictions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the EU, in relation to our products or the products of farmers and other customers;\n\u2022government limitations on foreign ownership;\n\u2022government takeover or nationalization of business;\n\u2022changes in tax laws and tariffs;\n\u2022imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions;\n\u2022costs and difficulties and compliance risks in staffing, managing and monitoring international operations, including in the use of overseas third-party goods and service providers;\n\u2022corruption risk inherent in business arrangements and regulatory contacts with foreign government entities;\n\u2022longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk; and\n\u2022additional limitations on transferring personal information between countries or other restrictions on the processing of personal information.\nIn addition, international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs. Compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technologies. A failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings, monetary or non-monetary penalties, or both, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products, and damage to our reputation. In addition, variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized re-importation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions. While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any of them could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, changes in any of these laws, regulations or requirements, or the political environment in a particular country, may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets, including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings.\nSignificant portions of our operations are conducted in Europe and could be impacted by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d\nIn June 2016, voters in the UK approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. On March 29, 2017, the UK Prime Minister formally notified the European Council of the UK's intention to withdraw from the EU under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Brexit formally occurred on January 31, 2020. A transition period is in effect from February 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020, during which the UK and the EU will negotiate a trade agreement. During this period, EU rules and regulations will remain in effect for the UK. The referendum and notice created political, regulatory and economic uncertainty, particularly in the UK and the EU, and this uncertainty may persist for years if the UK and the EU are unable to reach an agreement by the end of the transition period.\nOur business is subject to substantial regulation. If a trade agreement is not reached by the end of the transition period, we may not be able to market certain products that entered the EU market following marketing authorization by UK authorities in all the nations that are parties to free trade agreements with the EU unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we proposed to market those products.\nIn addition, the uncertainty related to Brexit has caused foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the past, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound immediately following the announcement of Brexit. Further developments with respect to Brexit could further impact foreign exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe end of the transition period with no agreement in place could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the UK and the EU, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe and declining gross domestic product in many European markets. The UK's exit from the EU could also result in similar referendums or votes in other European countries in which we do business.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK's withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and could affect sales or regulation of our products. Any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nForeign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.\nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. In 2019, we generated approximately 44% of our revenue in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.\nWe also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. While we currently have no need and do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place, should we need to do so to fund our operations, we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash, or may be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs.\nWe also bear foreign exchange risk associated with the future cash settlement of an existing net investment hedge. In October 2018, we entered into a fixed interest rate, 5-year, 750 million Swiss franc net investment hedge (NIH) against Swiss franc assets. The NIH is expected to generate approximately $25 million in cash and contra\ninterest expense per year; however, there is potential for significant 2023 settlement exposure on the 750 million Swiss franc notional if the U.S. dollar devalues versus the Swiss franc.\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.\nWe rely on various information systems to manage our operations, and we increasingly depend on third parties to operate and support our information technology systems, including by way of virtual and cloud-based operations. These third parties include large established vendors as well as small, privately owned companies. Failure by any provider to adequately service our operations, or a change in control or insolvency of one or more providers, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Prior to the Separation, we relied on Lilly to negotiate and manage many of our relationships and contracts with these third parties.\nIn connection with the Separation, we are continuing to enhance a number of our business processes, including our financial reporting and supply chain processes and with respect to where and from whom we obtain information technology systems. In order to support the new business processes under the terms of our transitional services agreement with Lilly, we have made and will continue to make significant configuration, process and data changes within many of the information technology systems we use. If our information technology systems and processes are not sufficient to support our business and financial reporting functions, or if we fail to properly implement our new business processes, our financial reporting may be delayed or inaccurate and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Even if we are able to successfully configure and change our systems, all technology systems, even with implementation of security measures, are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached, this could materially adversely affect our reputation and our ability to perform critical business functions, and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised.\nBreaches of our information technology systems or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and operations, or we may fail to comply with privacy laws, regulations and our contractual obligations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including customer, employee and company data. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and the legal environment surrounding information security, storage, use, processing, disclosure and privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. We also store certain information with third parties. Our information systems and those of our third-party vendors are subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber or phishing-attacks and also are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks and external hazards, as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior, all of which could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches. Any such breach could compromise our networks, and the information stored therein could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Such attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations, and other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs, and diversion of management attention. Any actual or perceived access, disclosure or other loss of information or any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, cyber-attack or corruption of customer, employee or company data or our failure to comply with federal, state, local and foreign privacy laws or contractual obligations with customers, vendors, payment processors and other third parties, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws or contracts that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations, and damage to our reputation, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, revenue and competitive position. While we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect cyber-incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. Our protective measures may not protect us against attacks and such attacks could have a significant impact on our business and reputation. In addition, prior to the Separation, we relied on Lilly for certain privacy and compliance functions and personnel and may experience difficulties maintaining and implementing all policies and practices following completion of the Separation.\nIncreased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising, processing or consumption of food animals could reduce demand for our food animal products.\nCompanies in the food animal sector are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations. See \u201cBusiness of Elanco - Regulatory.\u201d If food animal producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to\nexisting regulations, they may reduce herd or flock sizes or become less profitable and, as a result, they may reduce their use of our products, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, many food animal producers benefit from governmental subsidies, and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated, these companies may become less profitable and, as a result, may reduce their use of our food animal products. More stringent regulation of the food animal sector, including regarding the use of food animal products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages.\nSome of our employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the risk of labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. We may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages, higher ongoing labor costs or other labor problems in the future at our sites. We may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets. These risks may be increased by the Separation because we no longer benefit from Lilly\u2019s prior relationships and negotiations relating to such agreements.\nFurther, labor-related issues, including at our suppliers or CMOs, could cause a disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income.\nThe anticipated benefits of the Separation from Lilly may not be achieved.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation from Lilly. Further, such benefits, if ultimately achieved, may be delayed. These benefits include the following:\n\u2022improving strategic and operational flexibility and streamlining decision-making by providing the flexibility to implement our strategic plan and to respond more effectively to different customer needs and the changing economic and industry environment;\n\u2022allowing us to adopt the investment policy and dividend policy best suited to our financial profile and business needs, and allowing us to raise capital as an independent business;\n\u2022creating an independent equity structure that makes possible future acquisitions utilizing our common stock as well as compensation arrangements; and\n\u2022facilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of our business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives of our business.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Separation from Lilly for a variety of reasons, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have underfunded pension plan liabilities. We will require current and future operating cash flow to fund these shortfalls reducing the cash available for other uses.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension plans, predominantly outside of the U.S., that our employees participate in that are either dedicated to our employees or where the plan assets and liabilities that relate to our employees were legally required to transfer to us at the time of the Separation. The funded status and net periodic pension cost for these plans is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the longevity and actuarial profile of our workforce, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. As of December 31, 2019, for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation was $218.2 million with plan assets of $140.3 million. Any changes in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following years. Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years. The need to make additional cash contributions will\ndivert resources from our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses when we pursue acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other significant transactions, such as the acquisition of Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. and Prevtec Microbia Inc.\nWe finalized the acquisition of Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. on July 18, 2019 and the acquisition of Prevtec Microbia Inc. on July 31, 2019. Following the closing of the transactions, we are now required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the portfolio and operations of the target companies. Potential difficulties that we may encounter in the integration process, including as a result of distraction of our management, include the following:\n\u2022the inability to combine the businesses of the acquired companies with ours in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings or other synergies anticipated as a result of the transaction or to achieve such cost savings or other anticipated synergies in a timely manner, which could result in us not realizing some anticipated benefits of the transactions in the time frame anticipated, or at all;\n\u2022the inability to realize the anticipated value from various assets of the target companies;\n\u2022loss of key employees;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or unfavorable conditions in connection with the closing of the transactions and the subsequent integration; and\n\u2022performance shortfalls at our company or the target companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business activities as a result of completing the transaction and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds beyond the equity and debt issuances that have occurred in January and February 2020, our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. Furthermore, if we sell a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public markets, the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Such sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur historical combined financial data prior to the Separation is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nFor periods prior to the Separation, our historical combined financial data included in this report does not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future. This is primarily the result of the following factors:\n\u2022our historical combined financial data does not reflect the Separation;\n\u2022our historical combined financial data for periods prior to the Separation reflects expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within Lilly, such as expenses for executive oversight, treasury, legal, finance, human resources, tax, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology and investor relations that may be higher or lower than the comparable expenses we would have actually incurred, or will incur in the future, as a standalone company;\n\u2022our cost of debt and our capital structure has been different from that reflected in our historical combined financial statements for periods prior to the Separation;\n\u2022significant increases have occurred in our cost structure as a result of the IPO, including costs related to public company reporting, investor relations and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\n\u2022the IPO had a material effect on our customers and other business relationships, including supplier relationships, and resulted in the loss of preferred pricing available by virtue of our reduced relationship with Lilly.\nOur financial condition and future results of operations, after giving effect to the Separation, have been materially different from the amounts for periods prior to the Separation reflected in our historical combined financial statements included in this report. As a result of the Separation, it may be difficult for investors to compare our 2019 and future results to historical results prior to the Separation or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business.\nRisks Related to the Pending Acquisition of the Bayer Animal Health Business (the Acquisition)\nThe proposed acquisition of the Bayer animal health business may not be completed on the anticipated terms and there are uncertainties and risks related to consummating the Acquisition.\nIn August 2019, we entered into a share purchase agreement (Purchase Agreement) to purchase the animal health business of Bayer for approximately $5.3 billion in cash and approximately $2.3 billion of our common stock, subject to certain customary adjustments. Our obligation to consummate the Acquisition is subject to satisfaction or waiver, to the extent permitted under applicable law, of a number of conditions. Among other conditions, the Acquisition is subject to antitrust approvals in certain jurisdictions. We cannot provide any assurance that all required antitrust clearances will be obtained and what conditions will be imposed. There can be no assurance as to the cost, scope or impact of the actions that may be required, including divestiture actions, to obtain antitrust approval. If we are required to or otherwise decide to take such actions in order to close the Acquisition, it could be detrimental to the combined organization following the consummation of the Acquisition, including with respect to the synergies which we expect from the Acquisition. For example, in January 2020, we signed agreements to divest Osurnia, a treatment for otitis externa in dogs, and the U.S. rights to Capstar, an oral tablet that kills fleas in dogs and cats, for an aggregate of $230 million in all cash deals, with the intent to advance our efforts to secure the necessary regulatory clearances for the Acquisition. Furthermore, these actions, or the failure to effect any divestitures at an acceptable price or at all, could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Acquisition or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues or cash of the combined organization following the consummation of the Acquisition.\nEven if the parties receive antitrust approvals, the applicable domestic or international regulatory authorities could take action under the antitrust laws to prevent or rescind the Acquisition, require the divestiture of assets or seek other remedies. Additionally, state attorneys general could seek to block or challenge the Acquisition as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest at any time, including after completion of the Acquisition. In addition, in some circumstances, a third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the Acquisition, before or after it is completed. We may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.\nWe may be unable to integrate the Bayer animal health business successfully and realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition.\nIf the Acquisition is completed, the successful integration of the Bayer animal health business and operations into those of our own and our ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the Transactions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. We will also be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating business practices, cultures and operations of each business. The risks and uncertainties relating to integrating the two businesses and realizing the anticipated cost synergies include, among other things:\n\u2022the challenge of integrating complex organizations, systems, operating procedures, compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets of the Bayer animal health business;\n\u2022the difficulties harmonizing differences in the business cultures of our company and the Bayer animal health business;\n\u2022the inability to combine successfully our respective businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings, synergies and other anticipated benefits from the Acquisition;\n\u2022the inability to minimize the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns during the process of integrating the Bayer animal health business into our businesses;\n\u2022the inability to resolve potential conflicts that may arise relating to customer, supplier and other important relationships of our business and the Bayer animal health business;\n\u2022difficulties in retaining key management and other key employees;\n\u2022the challenge of managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company and coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022difficulties in fully exploring intellectual property licensed from Bayer in connection with the acquisition, given Bayer's rights as licensor of such intellectual property.\nWe will incur substantial expenses to consummate the proposed Acquisition but may not realize the anticipated cost synergies and other benefits to the extent expected, on the timeline expected, or at all. In addition, even if we are able to integrate the Bayer animal health business successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Moreover, competition in the animal health industry, including competition that has negatively impacted results in the companion animal parasiticide market, may also cause us not to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition. Given the size and significance of the Acquisition, we may encounter difficulties in the integration of the operations of the Bayer animal health business and may fail to realize the full benefits and synergies of the Acquisition, which could adversely impact our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Bayer animal health business may have liabilities that are not known to us.\nThe Bayer animal health business may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigations of the Bayer animal health business. We cannot assure that the indemnification available to us under the Purchase Agreement in respect of the Acquisition in connection with such agreement will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the Bayer animal health business or property that we will assume upon consummation of the Acquisition. We may learn additional information about the Bayer animal health business that materially adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisition accounting adjustments could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe will account for the completion of the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. We will allocate the total estimated purchase price to net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the Acquisition record the excess, if any, of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Differences between preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting may occur, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated and combined financial statements and the combined company\u2019s future results of operations and financial position.\nFailure to complete the Acquisition could impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022depending on the reasons for the failure to complete the Acquisition, we could be liable to Bayer for monetary or other damages in connection with the termination or breach of the Purchase Agreement;\n\u2022we have dedicated significant time and resources, financial and otherwise, in planning for the Acquisition and the associated integration, of which we would lose the benefit if the Acquisition is not completed;\n\u2022we are responsible for certain transaction costs relating to the Acquisition, whether or not the Acquisition is completed;\n\u2022while the Purchase Agreement is in force, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, including taking any action that is reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Acquisition, which restrictions may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies; and\n\u2022matters relating to the Acquisition (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, whether or not the Acquisition is completed, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us.\nIn addition, if the Acquisition is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. We also may be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Acquisition or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Purchase Agreement. If the Acquisition is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition, as well as the price of our common stock.\nWhile the Acquisition is pending, we and the Bayer animal health business will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our respective businesses.\nOur success following the announcement of the Acquisition will depend in part upon the ability of us and the Bayer animal health business to maintain our respective business relationships. Uncertainty about the effect of the Acquisition on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies may have a material adverse effect on us and the Bayer animal health business. Customers, suppliers and others who deal with us or the Bayer animal health business may delay or defer business decisions, decide to terminate, modify or renegotiate their relationships or take other actions as a result of the Acquisition that could negatively affect the revenues, earnings and cash flows of our company or the Bayer animal health business. If we are unable to maintain these business and operational relationships, our financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected.\nOur debt following the completion of the Acquisition will be significant and could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we priced a $4.3 billion term facility and a $750.0 million revolving credit facility (the New Credit Facilities) in February 2020, which will become effective at the closing of the Acquisition.\nThis significant amount of debt and other cash needs could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on this debt, thereby limiting the cash we have available to fund future growth opportunities, such as R&D, capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u2022restrictive covenants in our debt arrangements, which could limit our operations and borrowing;\n\u2022the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, increasing future debt costs and limiting the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, due to the need to use our cash to service our outstanding debt;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged with debt and that may therefore be more able to invest in their business or use their available cash to pursue other opportunities, including acquisitions; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nIn addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nThe issuance of our common stock to Bayer under the Purchase Agreement will be dilutive to our shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock.\nFollowing the closing of the Acquisition, Bayer will own shares of our common stock valued at approximately $2.3 billion based on trading prices before the closing of the Acquisition, subject to a minimum and maximum number of shares as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The shares are subject to limited lock-up obligations and following the expiration of such lock-up obligations (the latest of which expire 12 months after the closing of the Acquisition), Bayer is free to sell the shares of our common stock received at the closing of the Acquisition. In addition, under the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to provide Bayer with customary shelf registration rights.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may drop significantly as a result of the resale of the consideration shares, or when the lock-up restrictions on resale by Bayer lapse. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant shareholders.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness and expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, in addition to $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes, we had $371.4 million of borrowings under a term loan, which was retired in January 2020 using the proceeds from our most recent equity offering. We have an additional $750.0 million of borrowing capacity ($1.0 billion if certain conditions are met) under our existing revolving facility. See Note 9: Debt to our consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion.\nWe expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the Acquisition under the New Credit Facilities. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing other indebtedness;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements, including dividends;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022making us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are and may in the future be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the animal health industry;\n\u2022impacting our effective tax rate; and\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the credit agreement expected to govern the New Credit Facilities is expected to contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt, which could intensify the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future, even following the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the Acquisition. Although we expect that the terms of the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facilities will contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are expected to be subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions are also not expected to prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition to our borrowings under the New Credit Facilities, the covenants under the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facilities are expected to, and the covenants under any other of our existing or future debt instruments could, allow us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness and, subject to certain limitations, such additional indebtedness could be secured. The more leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn our security holders, will be exposed to certain risks described above under \u201c-We have substantial indebtedness and expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness.\u201d\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of material assets or operations, alter our dividend policy, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries, including certain international subsidiaries, and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make adequate distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal, tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur debt agreements following the completion of the Acquisition are expected to contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur existing term facility and revolving credit facility contain, and the New Credit Facilities are expected to contain, and any other existing or future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022make loans or certain investments;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022create liens on certain assets;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022substantially alter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the New Credit Facilities are expected to require us to comply with a net total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio under certain circumstances.\nAs a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nA failure to comply with the covenants under the existing term facility, the existing revolving credit facility, the indenture that governs the senior unsecured notes, the New Credit Facilities, or any of our other existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of an event of default under the New Credit Facilities, it is expected that the lenders:\n\u2022will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit;\n\u2022could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\u2022could effectively prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes (due to a cash sweep feature).\nSuch actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness, including our senior unsecured notes. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the New Credit Facilities and any of our other existing or future secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the New Credit Facilities or such other indebtedness. We are expecting to pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the New Credit Facilities.\nThe terms and conditions of the New Credit Facilities have not been finalized.\nThe credit agreement relating to the New Credit Facilities has not been finalized. Our entry into the New Credit Facilities is subject to market conditions, and we cannot assure you that the New Credit Facilities will be completed, in the manner, on the terms or on the timetable described herein, or at all. Future changes in market conditions may result in less favorable terms for the New Credit Facilities and any changes to the terms of the New Credit Facilities\nmay increase our interest expense and adversely affect our business. The terms of the New Credit Facilities could also change in a way that increases our indebtedness or makes it easier to incur debt in the future.\nChanges in our credit rating could increase our interest expense and restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nCredit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall view of our industry. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on us and certain of our debt. As a result of the Acquisition, our credit ratings may be downgraded. Because the ratings of certain of our senior unsecured notes have been downgraded, we will be required to pay additional interest under the senior unsecured notes. Any further downgrades could result in requiring us to pay additional interest under the senior unsecured notes. Moreover, any decision to downgrade our ratings could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings and trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials or other vendors.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and/or cash flows.\nOur revolving credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates that use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the FCA Announcement). The FCA announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Recent proposals for LIBOR reforms may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating LIBOR or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates. Although our revolving credit facility provides for successor base rates, the successor base rates may be related to LIBOR, and the consequences of any potential cessation, modification or other reform of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend our existing or enter into a new revolving credit facility, and we cannot predict what alternative interest rate(s) will be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result, our interest expense may increase, our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness may be affected and our available cash flow may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Relationship with Lilly\nAs a result of the Separation, we no longer have access to Lilly\u2019s brand, reputation, capital base and other resources.\nWe believe our association with Lilly has contributed to our building relationships with our customers due to Lilly\u2019s globally recognized brand and perceived high-quality products. The Separation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which could result in reduced sales of our products.\nThe loss of Lilly\u2019s scale, capital base and financial strength may also prompt suppliers to reprice, modify or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, Lilly\u2019s reduction of its ownership of our company could potentially cause some of our existing agreements and licenses to be terminated. We cannot predict with certainty the effect that the Separation will have on our business, our clients, vendors or other persons, or whether our brand will be accepted in the marketplace.\nFurther, because we have only operated as a standalone company for a limited period of time, we may have difficulty doing so. We may need to acquire assets and resources in addition to those provided by Lilly, and in connection with the Separation, may also face difficulty in separating our assets from Lilly\u2019s assets and integrating newly acquired assets into our business. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty operating as a standalone company, fail to acquire assets that prove to be important to our operations or incur unexpected costs in separating our assets from Lilly\u2019s assets or integrating newly-acquired assets.\nLilly may compete with us.\nLilly is not restricted from competing with us in the animal health business. Although Lilly informed us it had no intention to compete with us in the animal health business, if Lilly in the future decides to engage in the type of\nbusiness we conduct, it may have a competitive advantage over us, which may cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be materially adversely affected.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Lilly and its shareholders of the Separation and certain related transactions, we may not be able to engage in certain transactions.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Lilly and its shareholders of the Separation and certain related transactions, under a tax matters agreement with Lilly, we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These restrictions limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including using our common stock to make acquisitions and in connection with equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business. Because of these restrictions, following the issuance of our common stock and tangible equity units in public offerings completed in January 2020, and the issuance of the consideration shares to Bayer in connection with the Acquisition, we will have limited or no ability to issue shares of our common stock in the near term.\nLilly\u2019s rights as licensor under the intellectual property and technology license agreement could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.\nPrior to the Separation, we had the ability to leverage certain of Lilly\u2019s intellectual property. As part of the Separation, we entered into an intellectual property and technology license agreement. Pursuant to the intellectual property and technology license agreement, Lilly licenses to us certain of its intellectual property (excluding trademarks) related to the animal health business and also grants a license for us to use Lilly\u2019s proprietary compound library for a period of two years plus up to three additional one-year periods, each such period to be granted under Lilly\u2019s sole discretion. If we fail to comply with our obligations under this agreement and Lilly exercises its right to terminate it, our ability to continue to research, develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited. In addition, this agreement includes limitations that affect our ability to develop and commercialize certain products, including in circumstances where Lilly has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs. These limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult, time consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products, or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors. For a summary description of the terms of the intellectual property and technology license agreement, see Note 20: Related Party Agreements and Transactions to our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant charges in connection with the Separation and incremental costs as a standalone public company.\nWe are currently replicating or replacing certain functions, systems and infrastructure to which we no longer have the same access after the Separation. We have also made and will continue to make investments or hire additional employees to operate without the same access to Lilly\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure. These initiatives may be costly to implement. Due to the scope and complexity of the underlying projects relative to these efforts, the amount of total costs could be materially higher than our estimates, and the timing of the incurrence of these costs is subject to change.\nPrior to the Separation, Lilly performed or supported many important corporate functions for us. Our consolidated and combined financial statements prior to the Separation reflect charges for these services on an allocated basis. Following the Separation, many of these services are governed by our transitional services agreement with Lilly. Under the transitional services agreement we are able to use these Lilly services for a fixed term established on a service-by-service basis. Partial reduction in the provision of any service or termination of a service prior to the expiration of the applicable fixed term requires Lilly\u2019s consent. In addition, either party is able to terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the other party, upon prior written notice, subject to limited cure periods or if the other party undergoes a change of control.\nWe pay Lilly mutually agreed-upon fees for these services, which are based on Lilly\u2019s costs (including third-party costs) of providing the services through March 31, 2021 and subject to a mark-up of 7% thereafter, with additional inflation-based escalation beginning January 1, 2022. However, since our transitional services agreement was negotiated in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship, the terms of the agreement, including the fees charged for the services, may be higher or lower than those that would be agreed to by parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length for similar services and may be higher or lower than the costs reflected in the allocations in our historical consolidated and combined financial statements. In addition, while these services are being provided to us by Lilly, our\noperational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them will be limited.\nWe may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those that we receive from Lilly under the transitional services agreement. Additionally, after the transitional services agreement terminates, we may be unable to sustain the services at the same levels or obtain the same benefits as when we were receiving such services and benefits from Lilly. When we begin to operate these functions separately, if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place, or are unable to obtain them from other providers, we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs, and our profitability may decline. In addition, we have historically received informal support from Lilly, which may not be addressed in the transitional services agreement. The level of this informal support may diminish or be eliminated in the future.\nRisks Related to Elanco Common Stock\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were 373 million shares of our common stock outstanding, approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise or vesting of outstanding equity awards and an additional 8 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2018 Elanco Stock Plan and Elanco Animal Health Incorporated Directors\u2019 Deferral Plan; issuances of these shares are registered on our Registration Statement on Form S-8. Accordingly, shares of our common stock registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market upon exercise or vesting by the holders of such awards, subject to vesting restrictions and Rule 144 limitations applicable to our affiliates.\nOn January 27, 2020, we issued approximately 25 million shares of our common stock in a registered public offering. Additionally, we issued on such date 11 million tangible equity units in a registered public offering. Unless settled earlier, each purchase contract that is a component of a tangible equity unit will settle automatically on the mandatory settlement date into up to 1.5625 shares of our common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. All of the shares of common stock and tangible equity units sold in the public offering, as well as the shares of common stock issuable upon settlement of the units, are and will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act by persons other than our \u201caffiliates\u201d and sales of the shares of common stock, the units or the underlying common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to issue the consideration shares to Bayer and to use our reasonable best efforts to file a shelf registration statement to register such shares within 60 days after the closing date of the Acquisition. The Purchase Agreement provides that, subject to certain lock-up restrictions with respect to the transfer of the consideration shares, Bayer may request that we complete underwritten offerings with respect the consideration shares, subject to limitations on minimum offering size. The completion of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of antitrust approvals and the absence of any law or order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Acquisition in specified jurisdictions. Bayer will receive the consideration shares at the completion of the Acquisition.\nAny shares of common stock sold by Bayer under the shelf registration statement in compliance with or following the expiration of the lock-up provisions under the Purchase Agreement will be freely tradable. In the event Bayer exercises its registration rights and sells a large number of shares of our common stock, such sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. These sales or the prospects of these sales or any other sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital.\nIn addition, subject to compliance with our tax matters agreement with Lilly, we may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible debt securities to finance future acquisitions or for other corporate purposes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or other securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock or other securities will have on the market price of our common stock . Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares of common stock issued in connection with the\nAcquisition or any future acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nInvestors should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and should invest in our common stock only if the investor can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of the investment. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section of the annual report on Form 10-K, are:\n\u2022our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u2022failures to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure or dividend policy future issuances of securities, sales of large blocks of common stock by our shareholders or our incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022reputational issues;\n\u2022changes in general economic and market conditions in or any of the regions in which we conduct our business;\n\u2022changes in industry conditions or perceptions; and\n\u2022changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and other dynamics.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or related industries, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nThe market price of our common stock is also likely to be influenced by the tangible equity units issued by us. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:\n\u2022investors' anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock received upon settlement of the purchase contracts that are a component of the units;\n\u2022possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the units as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving the units and our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. We intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of outstanding debt. The New Credit Facilities are expected to contain restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be your major source of gain for the foreseeable future. While we may change this policy at some point in the future, we cannot assure you that we will make such a change.\nThe distributions we pay on our common stock may not qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of owning our common stock.\nGenerally, any distributions that we make to a stockholder with respect to its shares of our common stock will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. While we expect that we will have accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, allocated to us as a result of our separation from Lilly, this allocation has not yet been finalized. Furthermore, our ability to generate earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any future year is subject to a number of variables that are uncertain and difficult to predict.\nGenerally, any distribution not constituting a dividend under the rules described above will be treated as first reducing the investor's adjusted basis in shares of our common stock and, to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis in shares of our common stock, as gain from the sale or exchange of such shares, and if the investor is a domestic corporation, it will not be entitled to claim, with respect to such non-dividend distribution, a \u201cdividends-received\u201d deduction, which generally applies to dividends received from other domestic corporations.\nApplicable laws and regulations, provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage takeover attempts and business combinations that shareholders might consider in their best interests.\nApplicable laws, provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and certain contractual rights that have been granted to Lilly under the master separation agreement may delay, deter, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. For example, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that are intended to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover, which could deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions provide for:\n\u2022a board of directors divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022advance notice requirements regarding how our shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with such powers, rights and preferences as the board of directors shall determine;\n\u2022only the board of directors to fill newly-created directorships or vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and require that all shareholder action be taken at a meeting rather than by written consent;\n\u2022a two-thirds shareholder vote requirement to amend our amended and restated articles of incorporation;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our board of directors to amend our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022the requirement that a 66 2/3% vote is necessary to remove directors.\nThese limitations may adversely affect the prevailing market price and market for our common stock if they are viewed as limiting the liquidity of our stock or discouraging takeover attempts in the future.", "PERMNO": 18062, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ELAN"}
