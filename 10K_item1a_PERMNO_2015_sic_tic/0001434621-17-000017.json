{"cik": "1434621", "company": "LendingTree, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report and the information incorporated by reference herein. If any of the risks described below, or incorporated by reference into this annual report actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See the information included under the heading \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.\"\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nAdverse conditions in the primary and secondary mortgage markets, as well as the general economy, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConstraints in the primary and secondary mortgage markets have in the past had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Generally, increases in interest rates adversely affect the ability of our Network Lenders to close loans, and adverse economic trends limit the ability of our Network Lenders to offer home loans other than low-margin conforming loans. Our businesses may experience a decline in demand for their offerings due to decreased consumer demand as a result of the conditions described above, now or in the future. Conversely, during periods with decreased interest rates, Network Lenders have less incentive to use our marketplaces, or in the case of sudden increases in consumer demand, our Network Lenders may lack the ability to support sudden increases in volume.\nWe depend on relationships with Network Lenders and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in significant part on the financial strength of lenders participating on our marketplaces and continuing relationships with such lenders. Network Lenders could, for any reason, experience financial difficulties and cease participating on our lender marketplace, fail to pay match and/or closing fees when due and/or drop the quality of their services to consumers. We could also have commercial or other disputes with such Network Lenders from time to time. The occurrence of one or more of these events with a significant number of Network Lenders could, alone or in combination, have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain brand recognition and attract and retain consumers in a cost-effective manner could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to attract visitors to our websites, convert these visitors into loan requests for our Network Lenders and lead purchasers and generate repeat visits from consumers, our businesses must promote and maintain their various brands. Brand promotion and maintenance requires the expenditure of considerable money and resources for online and offline advertising, marketing and related efforts, as well as the continued provision and introduction of high-quality products and services.\nBrand recognition is a key differentiating factor among providers of online services. We believe that continuing to build and maintain the recognition of our various brands is critical to achieving increased demand for the services provided by our businesses. Accordingly, we have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant amounts on, and devote significant resources to, branding, advertising and other marketing initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective. The failure of our businesses to maintain the recognition of their respective brands and attract and retain consumers in a cost-effective manner could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse publicity from legal proceedings against us or our businesses, including governmental proceedings and consumer class action litigation, or from the disclosure of information security breaches, could negatively impact our various brands, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the actions of our third-party marketing partners who engage in advertising on our behalf could negatively impact our various brands.\nWe depend on search engines and other online sources to attract visitors to our websites, and if we are unable to attract these visitors and convert them into loan requests for our Network Lenders and lead purchasers in a cost-effective manner, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract online consumers to our websites and convert them into customers in a cost-effective manner. We depend, in part, on search engines and other online sources for our website traffic. We are included in search results as a result of both paid search listings, where we purchase specific search terms that result in the inclusion of our\nadvertisement, and, separately, organic searches, that depend upon the searchable content on our sites. Search engines and other online sources revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search results.\nIf one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for website traffic were to modify its general methodology for how it displays our websites, resulting in fewer consumers clicking through to our websites, our business could suffer. If any free search engine traffic on which we rely begins charging fees for listing or placement, or if one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for purchased listings, modifies or terminates its relationship with us, our expenses could rise, we could lose customers, and traffic to our websites could decrease, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with a number of other online marketing companies, and we face the possibility of new competitors.\nWe currently compete with a number of other online marketing companies and we expect that competition will intensify. Some of these existing competitors may have more capital or complementary products or services than we do, and they may leverage their greater capital or diversification in a manner that adversely affects our competitive position, including by making strategic acquisitions. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and may be able to innovate and bring products and services to market faster, or anticipate and meet consumer or Network Lender demand before we do. Other newcomers, including major search engines and content aggregators, may be able to leverage their existing products and services to our disadvantage. We may be forced to expend significant resources to remain competitive with current and potential competitors. If any of our competitors are more successful than we are at attracting and retaining customers or Network Lenders, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures, including websites, information and related systems, call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructures may materially and adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. We may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders. We also rely on affiliate and third-party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally, as well as to facilitate, process and fulfill transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems and infrastructures, our businesses, our affiliates and/or third parties, or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures, could impair the ability of our businesses to provide services, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, unauthorized intrusions or computer viruses, and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent our businesses from providing services, fulfilling orders and/or processing transactions. While our businesses have backup systems for certain aspects of their operations, these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA breach of our network security or the misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information maintained by us or our third-party marketing partners could cause interruptions in the operations of our businesses and subject us to increased costs, litigation and other liabilities. Claims could also be made against us or our third-party marketing partners for other misuse of personal information, such as for unauthorized purposes or identity theft, which could result in litigation and financial liabilities, as well as administrative action from governmental authorities. Real or perceived security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers and third parties with whom we do business.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with whom we are affiliated or otherwise conduct business with online. Consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the Internet, and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses and/or those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation and indemnification of secondary market purchasers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn connection with the sale of loans to secondary market purchasers, Home Loan Center, Inc. (\"HLC\") may be liable for certain indemnification, repurchase and premium repayment obligations. For example, in connection with the sale of loans to secondary market purchasers, HLC made certain representations regarding related borrower credit information, loan documentation and collateral. To the extent that these representations were incorrect, HLC may be required to repurchase loans or indemnify secondary market purchasers for losses due to borrower defaults. HLC also agreed to repurchase loans or indemnify secondary market purchasers for losses due to early payment defaults (i.e., late payments during a limited time period immediately following HLC's origination of the loan). Further, HLC agreed to repay all or a portion of the initial premiums paid by secondary market purchasers in instances where the borrower prepays the loan within a specified period of time. HLC has made payments for these liabilities in the past and expects to make payments for these liabilities in the future.\nWe continue to be liable for these indemnification obligations, repurchase obligations and premium repayment obligations following the sale of substantially all of the operating assets of our LendingTree Loans business. We have in the past and intend to continue to negotiate in the future with secondary market purchasers to settle any existing and future contingent liabilities, but we cannot assure you we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The occurrence of indemnification claims, repurchase obligations or premium repayments beyond our reserves for these contingencies, or our inability to settle with secondary market purchasers, may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected the mortgage industry.\nDeclines in the housing market from 2006 through early 2012, as measured by the S&P/Case-Schiller 20-city composite home price index, with home price declines and increased foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment, negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but subsequently of other asset-backed securities, credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities, in turn, caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail.\nReflecting concern about the stability of the housing markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. This market disruption and tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence and increased market volatility. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has had in the past and may have in the future, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile conditions in the housing markets have improved since 2013, the failure to sustain such improvements could have adverse effects on us and our Network Lenders. Further, our business could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other businesses in the financial services sector. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more of these entities, or the financial services industry generally, have in the past, and may in the future, lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to disruptions in the mortgage industry. Any such disruption could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur recent revenue growth has been driven in significant part by personal loan offerings. If lenders participating on our marketplace decide to reduce their offerings of personal loans or if such loans become unattractive to consumers because of higher interest rates demanded by lenders, then our results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe re-launched our personal loan product in the third quarter of 2013. Revenue from personal loan offerings was responsible for a significant portion of the growth in the non-mortgage revenue over the last few years. Revenue from our personal loan product increased $15.2 million in 2016 from 2015 and $38.9 million in 2015 from 2014.\nPersonal loans are unsecured obligations and generally carry shorter terms and smaller loan amounts than mortgages. Because they are unsecured, they are generally riskier assets for lenders than mortgages or other secured loans. Consumer demand for unsecured loans offered on our marketplace is often for refinancing of higher interest credit card debt or for a lower interest alternative to credit card debt for a contemplated larger purchase that would otherwise be purchased with a credit card. Lenders participating on our marketplace may reduce their willingness to make personal loans at more attractive interest rates than credit card debt and may for that reason, or for any other reason, reduce their demand for personal loan requests generated from our personal loan marketplace. Reasons that lenders might reduce their willingness to make personal loans at attractive interest rates may include regulatory changes, stricter institutional lending criteria, a lack of adequate funding sources or capital for loan originations, or increased borrower default levels, which may occur upon adverse changes in regional, national or global economic\nconditions. Additionally, lenders may tighten their underwriting standards, making it more difficult for consumers to qualify for personal loans. If lenders participating on our marketplace decide to reduce their offerings of personal loans, tighten their underwriting standards, or if personal loans become unattractive to consumers because of higher interest rates demanded by lenders, then our results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nNetwork Lenders affiliated with our marketplaces are not precluded from offering products and services outside of our marketplaces, or obtaining products and services from our competitors.\nBecause our businesses do not have exclusive relationships with Network Lenders, consumers may obtain loans from these third-party service providers without having to use our marketplaces. Network Lenders can offer loans directly to consumers through their own marketing campaigns or other traditional methods of distribution, such as referral arrangements, physical store-front operations or broker agreements. Network Lenders may also offer loans and services to prospective customers online directly, through one or more online competitors of our businesses, or both. If a significant number of consumers seek loans and services directly from Network Lenders or through our competitors as opposed to through our marketplaces, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSome of our lending services are new to the market and may fail to achieve or maintain customer acceptance and profitability.\nWe have launched new non-mortgage products over the last several years. We do not have as much experience with these new non-mortgage products as with the mortgage products. Accordingly, new non-mortgage products may be subject to greater risks than our more mature mortgage products.\nThe success of new products we may offer will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nImplementing, at an acceptable cost, product features offered by our competitors and/or expected by consumers and lenders;\n\u2022\nMarket acceptance by consumers and lenders;\n\u2022\nOfferings by current and future competitors;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract and retain management and other skilled personnel for these businesses;\n\u2022\nOur ability to collect amounts owed to us from third parties;\n\u2022\nOur ability to develop successful and cost-effective marketing campaigns; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to timely adjust marketing expenditures in relation to changes in demand for the underlying products and services offered by our lead purchasers.\nOur results of operations may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage these issues associated with new products.\nIf we are unable to continually enhance our products and services and adapt them to technological changes and consumer and lender and/or lead purchaser needs, including the emergence of new computing devices and more sophisticated online services, we may lose market share and revenue and our business could suffer.\nWe need to anticipate, develop and introduce new products, services and applications on a timely and cost-effective basis that keep pace with technological developments and changing consumer and customer needs. For example, the number of individuals who access the internet through devices other than a personal computer, such as tablets, mobile telephones, televisions and set-top box devices has increased significantly and this trend is likely to continue. Because each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, our websites may not be functional or viewable on these devices. Additionally, new devices and new platforms are continually being released. Consumers access many traditional web services on mobile devices through applications, or apps.\nIt is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in improving our websites' functionality with these alternative devices or developing apps for mobile platforms. If we fail to develop our websites or apps to respond to these or other technological developments and changing consumer and customer needs cost effectively, we may lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our intellectual property rights, including patents, service marks, trademarks and domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and similar intellectual property (as applicable), as critical to our success. Our businesses also rely heavily upon software codes, informational databases and other components that make up their products and services.\nWe rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require legal action to correct. In addition, third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties.\nWe have generally registered and continue to apply to register, or secure by contract when appropriate, our principal trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve and register domain names when and where we deem appropriate. We generally consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation. While we vigorously protect our trademarks, service marks and domain names, effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the Internet using our various domain names or otherwise, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been granted patents and we have patent applications pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions. The status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions, and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. Accordingly, any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued, or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology. In March 2014, a federal jury found our two issued patents invalid. See Note 13-Contingencies-Intellectual Property Litigation-Zillow in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition, third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own.\nLikewise, the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that our processes or inventions will be found not to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties.\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business we are subjected to legal proceedings, claims and counterclaims, or threatened legal proceedings, claims or counterclaims, including allegations of infringement of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive. In 2014, we participated in a jury trial for the litigation described in Note 13-Contingencies-Intellectual Property Litigation-Zillow in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The legal expenses associated with this jury trial were material and negatively affected our results of operations for 2014.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating our risk of loss.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and strategic risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. There may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe intended benefits of the CompareCards acquisition may not be realized.\nThe CompareCards acquisition poses risks for our ongoing operations, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthat senior management\u2019s attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of the business acquired in the acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to retain key employees of CompareCards;\n\u2022\ncosts and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities;\n\u2022\nthat the business acquired in the acquisition may not perform as well as anticipated;\n\u2022\nadverse conditions in the economy may affect credit card issuers and their willingness to issue new credit;\n\u2022\ncredit card issuers and other advertisers in the business verticals in which we or CompareCards operate may be unwilling to advertise on our or CompareCards's websites or mobile applications;\n\u2022\nchanges in application approval rates by credit card issuer customers;\n\u2022\nincreased competition and its effect on our or CompareCards's website traffic, click-through rates, advertising rates, margins, and market share ability to provide competitive service to credit card issuers and to consumers using CompareCards' and our online offerings and other platforms;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain brand recognition for both us and CompareCards and to effectively leverage the LendingTree brand with the CompareCards brand;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new products and services and enhance existing ones;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with our ongoing litigation with NextAdvisor including the effect of the preliminary injunction obtained by NextAdvisor on a portion of the acquired CompareCards business; and\n\u2022\nassumed liabilities associated with CompareCards' historical operations, including as a result of privacy regulations or data breaches.\nAs a result of the foregoing, the CompareCards acquisition may not be accretive to us in the near term or at all. Furthermore, if we fail to realize the intended benefits of the business acquired in the acquisition, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the market price reflects an expectation of those benefits.\nOther acquisitions or strategic investments that we pursue may not be successful and could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe may consider or undertake strategic acquisitions of, or material investments in, businesses, products or technologies. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, or even if we do identify suitable candidates, they may be difficult to finance, expensive to fund and there is no guarantee that we can obtain any necessary regulatory approvals or complete such transactions on terms that are favorable to us. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility, it would reduce our cash balances and/or result in indebtedness we must service, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If the purchase price is paid with our stock, it would be dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, we may assume liabilities associated with a business acquisition or investment, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition. There may also be litigation or other claims arising in connection with an acquisition itself.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the personnel, operations, businesses, products or technologies of an acquisition or investment. Integration may be particularly challenging if we enter into a line of business in which we have limited experience and the business operates in a difficult legal, regulatory or competitive environment. We may find that we do not have adequate operations or expertise to manage the new business. The integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management's time and resources from our core business, which could impair our relationships with our current employees, customers and strategic partners and disrupt our operations. Acquisitions and investments also may not perform to our expectations for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel or customers. If we fail to integrate acquisitions or investments or realize the expected benefits, we may lose the return on these acquisitions or investments or incur additional transaction costs and our business and financial condition may be harmed as a result.\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our management team and our highly skilled employees, including our software engineers, analysts, marketing professionals and sales staff. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially and adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts they have undertaken and to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nNetwork Lenders and lead purchasers on our marketplaces may not provide competitive levels of service to consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our brands and businesses and their ability to attract consumers.\nThe ability of our businesses to provide consumers with a high-quality experience depends, in part, on consumers receiving competitive levels of convenience, customer service, price and responsiveness from Network Lenders and lead purchasers participating on our other marketplaces with whom they are matched. If these providers do not provide consumers with competitive\nlevels of convenience, customer service, price and responsiveness, the value of our various brands may be harmed, the ability of our businesses to attract consumers to our websites may be limited and the number of consumers matched through our marketplaces may decline, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our total revenue is derived from two Network Lenders, and our results from operations could be adversely affected and stockholder value harmed if we lose significant business from either of these Network Lenders.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, one Network Lender accounted for 13%, 12% and 13% of total revenue, and another Network Lender accounted for 15%, 11% and 11%, of total revenue. If either of these significant Network Lenders were to cease purchasing loan requests and the Company were unable to replace the associated demand, the loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the short term and potentially also the longer term. Also, if either Network Lender reduces its volume of loan requests for any reason, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the past and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable over the long term.\nWe have a history of incurring operating losses from continuing operations, including for the year ended December 31, 2014, and although we were profitable in 2015 and 2016, we have an accumulated deficit of $722.6 million at December 31, 2016. If we fail to maintain or grow our revenue and manage our expenses, we may incur significant losses in the future and not be able to maintain profitability.\nWe will experience costs and risks associated with a two building office complex we purchased in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIn December 2016, our subsidiary, Rexford Office Holdings, LLC, completed the purchase of two office buildings in Charlotte, North Carolina for an aggregate purchase price of $23.5 million. We intend to occupy a portion of this space and lease a portion of this space to other tenants. There are costs and risks associated with owning and leasing real estate that may apply to us in connection with owning and leasing these properties, including:\n\u2022\nreal estate taxes and maintenance costs;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties or lease defaults by our tenants;\n\u2022\ntenant turnover and loss of potential tenants to competing landlords;\n\u2022\nactions by competing landlords that may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties;\n\u2022\ncosts of compliance with governmental rules and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, and zoning laws and potential liability thereunder;\n\u2022\nchanges in the cost or availability of adequate insurance, including coverage for mold and asbestos;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with environmental conditions or retained liabilities for such conditions; and\n\u2022\nless flexibility to move into alternative space or expand into alternative geographic locations than we might have if we leased our primary headquarters.\nAny of these costs and risks may negatively impact our earnings and cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Failure to comply with the terms of any such facility could impair our rights to the assets that have been pledged as collateral under the facility.\nOn October 22, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary LendingTree, LLC entered into a $125.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility which matures on October 22, 2020 (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility can be used to finance working capital needs, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes, including to finance permitted acquisitions. We do not currently have any borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio and a consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense ratio. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, subject to certain exceptions, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ngrant liens;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers or make certain fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments, including dividends, distributions, stock repurchases or redemptions;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into restrictive transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into hedging transactions; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility requires LendingTree, LLC to pledge as collateral, subject to certain customary exclusions, 100% of the assets, including 100% of its equity in all of its subsidiaries. The obligations under this facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by LendingTree, Inc. and specific subsidiaries of LendingTree, LLC, which guarantees are secured by a pledge as collateral, subject to certain customary exclusions, of 100% of each such guarantor's assets, including 100% of its equity in all of its subsidiaries.\nIf an event of default occurs or if we otherwise fail to comply with any of the negative or affirmative covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders may declare all of the obligations and indebtedness under such facility due and payable. In such a scenario, the lenders could exercise their lien on the pledged collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information on the Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 11-Revolving Credit Facility, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIf our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry or our customers' industries. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during a period in which any impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nCharges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\nUnder GAAP, when we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired at their acquisition date fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. We also estimate the fair value of any contingent consideration. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are uncertain and involve significant judgments by management. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows:\n\u2022\ncosts incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention or relocation expenses;\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill or intangible assets;\n\u2022\na reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;\n\u2022\nimpairment of long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nidentification of, or changes to, assumed contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of any contingent consideration;\n\u2022\ncharges to our operating results due to duplicative pre-merger activities;\n\u2022\ncharges to our operating results from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and\n\u2022\ncharges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.\nSubstantially all of these potential charges would be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our acquisitions and the extent of acquisition accounting adjustments.\nIn particular, we acquired CompareCards in November 2016 for $80.7 million in cash at closing and contingent consideration payments of up to $22.5 million in each of 2017 and 2018. We assigned a fair value of the contingent consideration of $23.1 million. We will reassess this fair value quarterly, and increases or decreases based on the actual performance of CompareCards against the contingent consideration targets or other factors will cause decreases or increases, respectively, in our results of operations. These quarterly adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Compliance and Regulation\nFailure to comply with past, existing or new laws, rules and regulations, or to obtain and maintain required licenses, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe market and provide services in heavily regulated industries through a number of different channels across the United States. As a result, our businesses have been and remain subject to a variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions in the United States, which are subject to change at any time. The failure of our businesses to comply with past, existing or new laws, rules and regulations, or to obtain and maintain required licenses, could result in administrative fines and/or proceedings against us or our businesses by governmental agencies and/or litigation by consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our brand.\nOur businesses conduct marketing activities via the telephone, the mail and/or through online marketing channels, which general marketing activities are governed by numerous federal and state regulations, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, state telemarketing laws, federal and state privacy laws, the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act and its accompanying regulations and guidelines, among others. Increased regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") has resulted in restrictions on telephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers.\nAdditional federal, state and in some instances, local laws regulate secured and unsecured lending activities, which impacts the marketplace, lenders and consumers. These laws generally regulate the manner in which lending and lending-related activities are marketed or made available, including advertising and other consumer disclosures, payments for services and record keeping requirements; these laws include RESPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and various state laws. State laws often restrict the amount of interest and fees that may be charged by a lender or mortgage broker, or otherwise regulate the manner in which lenders or mortgage brokers operate or advertise.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of or inability to renew required licenses or registrations, loss of approval status, termination of contracts without compensation, administrative enforcement actions and fines, private lawsuits, including those styled as class actions, cease and desist orders and civil and criminal liability.\nMost states require licenses to solicit, broker or make loans secured by residential mortgages and other consumer loans to residents of those states, as well as to operate real estate referral and brokerage services, and in many cases require the licensure or registration of individual employees engaged in aspects of these businesses. In 2008, Congress mandated that all states adopt certain minimum standards for the licensing of individuals involved in mortgage lending or loan brokering. Compliance with these requirements may render it more difficult for us and our Network Lenders to operate or may raise our internal costs or the costs of our Network Lenders, which may be passed on to us through less favorable commercial arrangements. While our businesses have endeavored to comply with applicable requirements, the application of these requirements to persons operating online is not always clear. Moreover, any of the licenses or rights currently held by our businesses or our employees may be revoked prior to, or may not be renewed upon, their expiration. In addition, our businesses or our employees may not be granted new licenses or rights for which they may be required to apply from time to time in the future.\nLikewise, states or municipalities may adopt statutes or regulations making it unattractive, impracticable or infeasible for our businesses to continue to conduct business in such jurisdictions. The withdrawal from any jurisdiction due to emerging legal requirements could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are also subject to various state, federal and/or local laws, rules and regulations that regulate the amount and nature of fees that may be charged for transactions and incentives, such as rebates, that may be offered to consumers by our businesses, as well as the manner in which these businesses may offer, advertise or promote transactions. For example, RESPA generally prohibits the payment or receipt of referral fees and fee shares or splits in connection with residential mortgage loan transactions, subject to certain exceptions. The applicability of referral fee and fee sharing prohibitions to lenders and real estate\nproviders, including online networks, may have the effect of reducing the types and amounts of fees that may be charged or paid in connection with real estate-secured loan offerings or activities, including mortgage brokerage, lending and real estate brokerage services, or otherwise limiting our and our Network Lenders' ability to conduct marketing and referral activities.\nVarious federal, state and, in some instances, local, laws also prohibit unfair and deceptive sales practices. We have adopted appropriate policies and procedures to address these requirements (such as appropriate consumer disclosures and call scripting, call monitoring and other quality assurance and compliance measures), but it is not possible to ensure that all employees comply with our policies and procedures at all times.\nCompliance with these laws, rules and regulations is a significant component of our internal costs, and new laws, rules and regulations are frequently proposed and adopted, requiring us to adopt new procedures and practices. Changes to existing laws, rules and regulations or changes to interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations could result in further restriction of activities incidental to our business and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nParties through which our businesses conduct business similarly may be subject to federal and state regulation. These parties typically act as independent contractors and not as agents in their solicitations and transactions with consumers. We cannot ensure that these entities will comply with applicable laws and regulations at all times. Failure on the part of a lender, website operator or other third party to comply with these laws or regulations could result in, among other things, claims of vicarious liability or a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nRegulatory authorities and private plaintiffs may allege that we failed to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations where we believe we have complied. These allegations may relate to past conduct and/or past business operations, such as our discontinued mortgage origination operation (which was subject to various state and local laws, rules and regulations). Even allegations that our activities have not complied or do not comply with all applicable laws and regulations may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The alleged violation of such laws, rules or regulations may entitle an individual plaintiff to seek monetary damages, or may entitle an enforcing government agency to seek significant civil or criminal penalties, costs and attorneys' fees. Regardless of its merit, an allegation typically requires legal fee expenditures to defend against. We have in the past and may in the future decide to settle allegations of non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations when we determine that the cost of settlement is less than the cost and risk of continuing to defend against an allegation. Settlements may require us to pay monetary fines and may require us to adopt new procedures and practices, which may render it more difficult to operate or may raise our internal costs. The future occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are also subject to the Dodd-Frank Act, which contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, many of which have not yet been adopted and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other legislative and regulatory changes, could have a significant impact on us by, for example, requiring us to change our business practices, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, imposing additional costs on us, limiting fees we can charge, impacting the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate consumer financial services and products, including credit, savings and payment products. The effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations has been and could continue to be significant, depending upon remaining implementing regulations, the actions of our competitors and the behavior of other marketplace participants. In addition, we have been, and likely will continue to be required to invest significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the numerous regulations that are required to be issued under it.\nIn response to conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, as well as a heightened regulatory and Congressional focus on consumer lending, regulators have increased their scrutiny of the financial services industry, the result of which has included new regulations and guidance. We are unable to predict the long-term impact of this enhanced scrutiny. We are also unable to predict whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.\nThe collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nIn the processing of consumer transactions, our businesses receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. The collection, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the privacy and data security policies maintained by us and our businesses. Moreover, there are federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted\nin or from the governing jurisdiction. In the United States, regulations and interpretations concerning personally identifiable and data security promulgated by state and federal regulators, including the CFPB and FTC, could conflict or give rise to differing views of personal privacy rights. We could be materially and adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure, and/or the failure by the various third-party vendors and service providers with whom we do business, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage the reputation of these businesses, discourage potential users from our products and services and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or consumers, one or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the regulation of the Internet could negatively affect our business.\nLaws, rules and regulations governing Internet communications, advertising and e-commerce are dynamic and the extent of future government regulation is uncertain. Federal and state regulations govern various aspects of our online business, including intellectual property ownership and infringement, trade secrets, the distribution of electronic communications, marketing and advertising, user privacy and data security, search engines and Internet tracking technologies. Future taxation on the use of the Internet or e-commerce transactions could also be imposed. Existing or future regulation or taxation could hinder growth in or negatively impact the use of the Internet generally, including the viability of Internet e-commerce, which could reduce our revenue, increase our operating expenses and expose us to significant liabilities.\nIf Network Lenders fail to produce required documents for examination by, or other affiliated parties fail to make certain filings with, state regulators, we may be subject to fines, forfeitures and the revocation of required licenses.\nSome of the states in which our businesses maintain licenses require them to collect various loan documents from Network Lenders and produce these documents for examination by state regulators. While Network Lenders are contractually obligated to provide these documents upon request, these measures may be insufficient. Failure to produce required documents for examination could result in fines, as well as the revocation of our licenses to operate in certain states, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations promulgated by some states may impose compliance obligations on directors, executive officers, large customers and any person who acquires a certain percentage (for example, 10% or more) of the equity in a licensed entity, including requiring such persons to periodically file financial and other personal and business information with state regulators. If any such person refuses or fails to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to obtain certain licenses and existing licensing arrangements may be jeopardized. The inability to obtain, or the loss of, required licenses could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nFluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in significant decreases in the price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile since our spin-off. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, causing significant price variations to occur. As of December 31, 2016, since our spin-off, the price per share of our common stock has fluctuated from an intra-day low of $1.42 per share to an intra-day high of $139.59 per share. If the market price of our shares declines significantly, the value of an investment in our common stock would decline. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating and financial results;\n\u2022\nvariations in our projected operating and financial results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts' earnings estimates;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our Network Lenders or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common shares or our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or preferred or common shares we may issue in the future;\n\u2022\nchanges in our dividend payment policy or failure to execute our existing policy;\n\u2022\nactions by shareholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of other companies in our industry, including our customers and competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community, including short selling;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in laws or regulations affecting our industry or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions.\nRecently, and in the past, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the trading price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of your investment in our common shares. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business or financial results, including in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if those events do not directly affect us. You should also be aware that price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock are low. These factors may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the value of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for internet marketplace operators and lead-generation companies depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about the industry and specific companies. If one or more analysts covering us currently or in the future fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decline, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. If one or more recognized securities or industry analysts that cover our company or our industry in the future downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or industry, our stock price would likely decline.\nTwo holders of our common stock own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which concentrates voting control and limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of February 23, 2017, Douglas Lebda, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Liberty Interactive Corporation beneficially owned approximately 21% and 23%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. Liberty Interactive also has the right to nominate 20% of the total number of directors serving on the board, rounded up. Two of our seven directors, Neal Dermer and Craig Troyer, were nominated by Liberty Interactive.\nTherefore, for the foreseeable future, Mr. Lebda and Liberty Interactive will each have influence over our management and affairs and all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election or removal (with or without cause) of directors and approval of any significant corporate transaction, such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets. The interests of Mr. Lebda or Liberty Interactive may not necessarily align with the interests of our other stockholders. Mr. Lebda or Liberty Interactive could elect to sell a significant interest in us and you may receive less than the then-current fair market value or the price you paid for your shares as a result of such transaction. This concentrated control could delay, defer or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may otherwise support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock and might harm the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of common stock by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity incentive plans, or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If we were to raise capital in the future by selling shares of our common stock, or securities that are convertible into our common stock or issuing shares of our common stock in a business acquisition, their issuance would have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of our stockholders and, depending on the prices at which such\nshares or convertible securities are sold or issued, on their investment in our common stock and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the market prices of our common stock.\nUnder a registration rights agreement with Liberty Interactive, Liberty Interactive and its permitted transferees are entitled to three demand registrations rights (and unlimited piggyback registration rights) in respect of the shares of our common stock received by Liberty Interactive as a result of the spin-off and other shares of our common stock acquired by Liberty Interactive or its affiliates. These holders will also be permitted to exercise their registration rights in connection with certain hedging transactions that they may enter into in respect of the registrable shares. The presence of additional shares of our common stock trading in the public market, as a result of the exercise of such registration rights, may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our management and affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and/or amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nAuthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by our stockholders, up to five million shares of undesignated preferred stock, sometimes referred to as \"blank check preferred\";\n\u2022\nProhibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nProvide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office or by the sole remaining director;\n\u2022\nProvide that only our board of directors may change the size of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nSpecify that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of our board of directors or by a person specifically designated with such authority by the board; and\n\u2022\nProhibit stockholders from taking action by written consent.\nThe provisions described above may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing our management. These provisions may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, even if stockholders support such a change of control.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock during the four most recent fiscal years. We have no current intention to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. See Note 11-Revolving Credit Facility, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future for holders of our common stock.\nOur financial results fluctuate as a result of seasonality, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and may adversely affect our common stock price.\nOur mortgage products business is historically subject to seasonal trends. These trends reflect the general patterns of the mortgage industry and housing sales, which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons. In recent periods, broader cyclical trends in interest rates, as well as the mortgage and real estate markets, have upset the customary seasonal trends. However, seasonal trends may resume and our quarterly operating results may fluctuate. Our non-mortgage products businesses have various seasonality trends which may create further uncertainty in our quarterly operating results. See Item 1. Business-Seasonality included elsewhere in this report for more information. Any of these seasonal trends, or the combination of them, may negatively impact the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92775, "SIC": 6163, "TIC": "TREE"}
