{"cik": "1076930", "company": "GSI GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could cause the market value of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. These risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historic or expected results or cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate or decline.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers\u2019 businesses and levels of business activities.\nA large portion of our product sales are dependent on the need for increased capacity or replacement of inefficient manufacturing processes. These sales tend to lag behind other businesses in an economic recovery. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue, gross margin and operating expenses and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, uncertainty in our medical and industrial end markets has caused customers in those markets to purchase fewer products from us during certain recent quarters. If such uncertainty continues or worsens, we may not be able to meet anticipated revenue levels on a quarterly or annual basis. Moreover, a severe and/or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our customers\u2019 financial condition and the timing or levels of business activity of our customers and the industries we serve. In particular, reduced growth expectations in China and the uncertain European financial situation could have an impact on our customers\u2019 financial condition and ability to maintain product orders in the future. This may reduce the demand for our products or depress pricing for our products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nOur business depends significantly upon our customers\u2019 capital expenditures, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations.\nThe electronics materials processing industries are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment, in which many of our products are used. The timing, length and severity of these cycles, and their impact on our business, are difficult to predict. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market for our products.\nWe experienced significant cyclical fluctuations in the past. We cannot assure you that such slowdowns will not recur or that the impact of such slowdowns will be more or less significant compared to historical fluctuations.\nOur business success depends upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand, but doing so may require us to incur costs despite limited visibility toward future business declines.\nIn periods of weak demand, we may be required to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to motivate and retain key employees at the same time. Additionally, to remain competitive, we must also continually invest in research and development, which may inhibit our ability to reduce costs in a down cycle. Long product lead-times create a risk that we may purchase or manufacture inventories of products that we are unable to sell.\nDuring a period of increasing demand and rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity quickly. Our inability to quickly increase production in response to a surge in demand could prompt customers to look for alternative sources of supply or leave our customers without a supply, both of which events could harm our reputation and make it difficult for us to retain our existing customers or to obtain new customers.\nThe success of our business requires that we continually innovate.\nTechnology requirements in our markets are constantly advancing. We must continually introduce new products that meet evolving customer needs. Our ability to grow depends on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced products that address our customer\u2019s requirements. Developing new technology is a complex and uncertain process requiring us to accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with responsive products. Additionally, this requires that we manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, avoid excess inventory and ensure adequate supplies of new products. Failure to develop new products, failed market acceptance of new products or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business.\nIf we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.\nOur research and development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products within the time period our customers demand. Our competitors may introduce new or improved products, processes or technologies that make our current or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We may encounter delays or problems in connection with our research and development efforts. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nchanging product specifications and customer requirements;\n\u00b7\ninability to manufacture new products cost effectively;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations;\n\u00b7\nchanging market or competitive product requirements; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated engineering complexities.\nNew products often take longer to develop, may have fewer features than originally considered desirable and have higher costs than initially estimated. There may be delays in starting volume production of new products and/or new products may not be commercially successful. There may also be difficulty in sourcing components for new products. Any of these developments could harm our business, including our results of operations.\nCustomer order timing and other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period.\nChanges in customer order timing and the existence of certain other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Such factors include:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our customers\u2019 businesses;\n\u00b7\ntiming and recognition of revenues from customer orders;\n\u00b7\ntiming and market acceptance of new products or enhancements introduced by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\navailability of parts from our suppliers and the manufacturing capacity of our subcontractors;\n\u00b7\ndecisions by customers to reduce their purchases of our products;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the prices of our products or of our competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies.\nCertain of our sales come from products with high selling prices and significant lead times. We may receive several large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the next quarter. As a result, the timing and recognition of sales from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, our sales are reactive to changes in our customers\u2019 businesses. For instance, a customer that placed a large order in one period could subsequently experience a downturn in business and, as a result, could cancel an order or reduce the amount of products it purchases from us in future periods.\nA delay in a shipment or failure to meet our revenue recognition criteria near the end of a reporting period due, for example, to rescheduling or cancellations by customers or to unexpected difficulties experienced by us may cause sales in the period to decline significantly and may have a material adverse effect on our operations for that period.\nWe cannot predict how the market will react to new products produced by us or to enhancements made to our existing products. If any of our new or enhanced products contain defects or perceived defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived problems, or if our competitors release similar products or enhancements at the same time as us that are more widely accepted by our customers, our sales and results of operations for one or more reporting periods could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we or our competitors may raise or lower the prices of products in response to market demands or competitive pressures. If we lower the prices of our products, or if our competitors lower the prices of their products such that demand for our products weakens, our sales for one or more quarters may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can also cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter.\nAs a result of these factors, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on information technology systems throughout the Company to manage orders, process shipments to customers, manage inventory levels and maintain financial information. Events could result in the disruption of our systems, including power outages, computer attacks by hackers, viruses, catastrophes, hardware and software failures and other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a significant period of system disruption in information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to us.\nAs we transact a portion of our sales, and maintain significant cash balances, in foreign currencies, changes in interest rates, credit ratings or foreign currency rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA portion of our sales are derived from our European and Asian operations and include transactions in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen, while our products are mainly manufactured in the United States, United Kingdom and China. In the event of a decline in the value of the Euro, Japanese Yen or British Pound, we would typically experience a decline in our revenues and profit margins. If we increase the sale prices on our products sold in Europe and Japan in order to maintain profit margins and recover costs, we may lose customer sales to lower cost competitors.\nAdditionally, balances we maintain in foreign currencies create additional financial exposure to changing currency rates. We have in the past, and may in the future, attempt to mitigate these risks by purchasing foreign currency exchange contracts, and by investing in United States government issued treasury bills. However, if foreign currency rates were to change rapidly, we could incur material losses.\nOur reliance on international operations in foreign countries subjects us to risks not typically faced by companies operating exclusively in the United States.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 61% of our revenues from continuing operations were derived from operations and customers outside of the United States. The scope of our international operations subjects us to risks which could materially impact our results of operations, including:\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nincreases in shipping costs or increases in fuel costs;\n\u00b7\nlonger customer payment cycles;\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nuse of incompatible systems and equipment;\n\u00b7\nproblems with staffing and managing foreign operations in diverse cultures;\n\u00b7\nprotective tariffs;\n\u00b7\ntrade barriers and export/import controls;\n\u00b7\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u00b7\nincreased vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\ngovernment currency control and restrictions, delays, penalties or required withholdings on repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of recessionary foreign economies; and\n\u00b7\nacts of terrorism.\nWe cannot predict whether the United States or any other country will impose new quotas, tariffs, taxes or other trade barriers upon the importation or exportation of our products or supplies or gauge the effect that new barriers would have on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe also are subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business and could result in government investigations and/or injunctive, monetary or other penalties. Moreover, we face additional risks that our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services, because such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct.\nIncreased outsourcing of components manufacturing to manufacturers outside the United States leads to additional risks which could negatively impact our business.\nWe are increasingly outsourcing the manufacture of subassemblies to suppliers based in China and elsewhere overseas in order to reduce our manufacturing cost. However, economic, political or trade problems with foreign countries could substantially impact our ability to obtain critical parts needed in the timely manufacture of our products. Additionally, this practice increases our vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, our intellectual property.\nOur global operations are subject to extensive and complex import and export rules that vary among the legal jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to comply with these rules could result in substantial penalties.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import and export related laws and regulations, including U.S. export control and customs regulations and customs regulations of other countries. These regulations are complex and vary among the legal jurisdictions in which we operate. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with such regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Any of these penalties could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCustomers with liquidity issues may lead to additional bad debt expense. There can be no assurance that our open credit customers will pay the amounts they owe to us or that the reserves we maintain will be adequate to cover such credit exposure. In addition, to the extent that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers\u2019 ability to pay may be adversely impacted. Our customers\u2019 failure to pay and/or our failure to maintain sufficient reserves could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur reliance upon third party distribution channels subjects us to credit, inventory, business concentration, and business failure risks beyond our control.\nWe sell many of our products through resellers, distributors, and system integrators. As these third parties tend to have more limited financial resources than OEMs and end-user customers, they generally represent sources of increased credit risk. Any downturn in the business of our resellers, distributors, and systems integrators would in turn harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur sales also depend upon the ability of our OEM customers to develop and sell systems that incorporate our products. Adverse economic conditions, large inventory positions, limited marketing resources and other factors influencing these OEM customers could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial results. We cannot assure investors that our OEM customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, our financial condition or results of operations.\nOthers may violate our intellectual property rights and cause us to incur significant costs to protect our rights.\nOur future success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. We do not have personnel dedicated to the oversight, organization and management of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or disclosure, or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products outside of our patented intellectual property. It is possible that, despite our efforts, other parties may use, obtain or try to copy our technology and products. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other technologies that are similar to ours, that any patents will be issued from any application filed by us or that, if patents are issued, the claims allowed will be sufficient to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in a legal or administrative proceeding. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and time consuming and may involve initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, which could be costly.\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement may not be effective in some foreign countries where we operate or sell our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, we may lose significant business to our competitors.\nOur operating results would suffer if we are unable to successfully defend against claims of infringement by third parties.\nWe have received in the past, and could receive in the future, notices from third parties alleging that our products infringe patent or other proprietary rights. We believe that our products are non-infringing or that we have the patents and/or licenses to allow us to lawfully sell our products throughout the world. However, we may be sued for infringement. In the event any third party makes a valid claim against us or our customers for which a license was not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, our operating results would be adversely affected. Adverse consequences may also apply to our failure to avoid litigation for infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and, if we lose competitive advantages, our business would suffer adverse consequences.\nSome of our competition comes from established competitors that have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products and introduce new products. It is possible that we may not successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products of our competitors, or that the marketplace will not consider our products to be superior to competing products. To remain competitive, we will be required to invest heavily in research and development, marketing and customer service and support. However, we may not be able to make the necessary technological advances to maintain our competitive position and our products may not receive market acceptance. These factors would cause us not to be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development of new products.\nOur results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business or to grow the acquired businesses.\nAs part of our business strategy, we expect to broaden our product and service offerings by acquiring businesses, technologies, assets and product lines that we believe complement or expand our existing businesses. We have made, and expect to continue to make, acquisitions. We may fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our business and, as a result, may fail to realize the synergies, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, our ability to maintain and increase profitability of an acquired business will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate operations into our business. If revenues of acquired businesses grow more slowly than we anticipate or decline, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their profitability, in which case our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. For example, reductions in orders by a customer within our Visualization Solutions product line have caused our revenues in that business in 2013 and 2014 to be lower than we had expected when we acquired the business. Moreover, our acquisition activities may divert management\u2019s attention from our regular operations and managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could pose challenges for our management. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOur business strategy may include making strategic divestitures. There can be no assurance that any divestitures will provide business benefit.\nOur business strategy includes divesting certain non-core businesses. We sold certain assets and liabilities of our Laser Systems businesses in October 2012. During the second quarter of 2013, we sold our Semiconductor Systems business, and in July 2014, we sold our Scientific Lasers business. There may be additional sales of other non-core businesses in the future. The divestiture of an existing business could reduce our future profits and operating cash flows and make our financial results more volatile. A divestiture could also cause a decline in the price of our common shares and increased reliance on other elements of our core business operations. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with a divestiture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, there could be other negative unforeseen effects from a divestiture. We also may not find suitable purchasers for our non-core businesses and may continue to pay operating costs associated with these businesses. Failed attempts to divest non-core businesses may distract management\u2019s attention from other business activities, erode employee morale and customers\u2019 confidence and harm our business.\nIf we do not attract and retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel.\nOur success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating structure in the future. These actions may not improve our financial position, and may ultimately prove detrimental to our operations and sales.\nOur ability to reduce operating expenses is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take to reduce expenses and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize expected cost savings. If global conditions deteriorate and unfavorably impact our business, we may need to take additional restructuring actions, such as eliminating or consolidating certain of our facilities, reducing our headcount or eliminating certain positions. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could increase the cost of production versus our projections, both of which could adversely impact our operating and financial results. Further, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with our restructuring activities, including severance costs and the loss of trained employees with knowledge of our business and operations, could exceed our expectations and negatively impact our financial results. The elimination or consolidation of operations could also result in restructuring charges that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nProduct defects or problems with integrating our products with other vendors\u2019 products may seriously harm our business and reputation.\nWe produce complex products that can contain latent errors or performance problems. This could happen to both existing and new products. Such defects or performance problems could be detrimental to our business and reputation.\nIn addition, customers frequently integrate our products with other vendors\u2019 products. When problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relationship issues. These issues may also complicate our determination of the timing and amount of revenue recognition and could have a material negative impact on our business.\nDisruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers, including limited or single source suppliers, could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.\nThe production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. If the receipt of certain limited source or single source materials is delayed, our relationship with customers may be harmed if such delays cause us to miss our scheduled shipment deadlines. Certain of our businesses buy components, including limited or sole source items, from competitors of our other businesses, and certain of our businesses sell products to customers that compete with certain other segments of our business. This dynamic may adversely impact our relationship with these suppliers and customers. For example, these suppliers could increase the price of those components or reduce their supply of those components to us. Similarly, these customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements rather than purchasing products from us. Our businesses may be adversely affected by our other business relationships with customers and suppliers. Our current or alternative sources may not be able to continue to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If suppliers or subcontractors experience difficulties or fail to meet any of our manufacturing requirements, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any, on commercially reasonable terms. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.\nProduction difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe assemble our products at our facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom and China. Each of our products is typically manufactured in a single manufacturing location. If production activities at any of our manufacturing facilities were interrupted by a natural disaster or otherwise, our operations would be negatively impacted until we could establish alternative production and service operations. Significant production difficulties could be the result of:\n\u00b7\nmistakes made while transferring manufacturing processes between locations;\n\u00b7\nchanging process technologies;\n\u00b7\nramping production;\n\u00b7\ninstalling new equipment at our manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7\nshortage of key components; and\n\u00b7\nloss of electricity or employees\u2019 access to the manufacturing facilities due to natural disasters.\nIn addition, we may experience product delivery delays in the future. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies. We also ship our products through national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and local delivery practices. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain customers.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations, including those regarding the manufacture of products and the shipping of our products.\nCertain medical devices that we manufacture are subject to regulations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with such regulations, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues.\nIn recent years, the medical industry has undergone significant changes in order to reduce healthcare costs. This includes cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. Foreign and domestic governments have also undertaken efforts to control healthcare costs through legislation and regulation. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law health care reform legislation in the form of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d). One of the components of the PPACA is a 2.3% excise tax on the sales of most medical devices, which started in 2013 and has increased our cost of compliance and negatively affected our profit margin. Many of the impacts of the PPACA will not be known until those regulations are enacted over the next several years. The implementation of health care reform and medical cost containment measures in the U.S. and in foreign countries in which we operate could:\n\u00b7\ndecrease the price that we might establish for our products, which would result in lower product revenues to us;\n\u00b7\nrequire additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products; and\n\u00b7\ncreate new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices.\nChanges in governmental regulation of our business or our products could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.\nWe are subject to many governmental regulations, including but not limited to the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and certain health regulations related to the manufacture of products using beryllium, an element used in some of our products. Among other things, these regulations require us to file annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to conduct safety reviews, to incorporate design and operating features in products sold to end-users and to certify and label our products. Depending on the class of the product, various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices must be installed.\nWe are also subject to regulatory oversight, including comparable enforcement remedies, in the markets we serve. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConflict minerals regulations will cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nOn August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosures by public companies concerning tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as Conflict Minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rules require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. There are, and will be, costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture. We are subject to the federal regulation of the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to regulatory fines.\nFuture developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. It is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. Certain regulations may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. These redesigns may adversely affect the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions and reduce our profitability.\nIf we fail to implement new information technology systems successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on various centralized information systems throughout the Company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Some of our existing systems are no longer supported by the software system providers and need to be upgraded or replaced. If we are unable to successfully implement new systems or upgrade the existing systems, particularly those that record, process or manage financial information, we may experience disruption in our operations and may be unable to recognize the expected benefits associated with new systems.\nOur results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total assets included $158.0 million of net intangible assets, including goodwill. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, core technologies and technology licenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets.\nAdverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our businesses may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $41.4 million in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of lower expectations for sales and operating profit from our NDS business.\nRisks Relating to Taxes\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total net operating loss carryforwards totaled $4.5 million (tax effected). Our ability to use future tax deductions is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our tax attributes and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net tax attributes requires significant judgment and complex analysis. We consistently evaluate our tax attributes based on taxes recoverable in the carryback period, existing deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. Our ability to recover all of our tax attributes in certain jurisdictions depends upon our ability to continue to generate future profits. If actual results differ from our plans or we do not achieve the desired level of profitability in a given jurisdiction, we may be required to increase or record a valuation allowance on our tax attributes by taking a charge in the statement of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect future results.\nWe are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. From time to time, the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules where significant judgment is required to determine the impact of such changes on our provision for income taxes.\nOur effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation, which could impact our financial position.\nOur effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation as the effective income tax rate for each year is a function of (a) taxable income levels in numerous tax jurisdictions, (b) our ability to utilize recorded deferred tax assets, (c) taxes, interest, or penalties resulting from tax audits and (d) credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income. Further, tax law changes may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods.\nWe may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though GSIG is a non-U.S. corporation.\nGSI Group, Inc. is a holding company organized in Canada and is subject to Canadian tax laws. However, we are subject to U.S. tax rules and file U.S. federal income tax returns for our operations in the United States. In addition, distributions or payments from entities in one jurisdiction to entities in another jurisdiction may be subject to withholding taxes. We do not intend to operate in a manner that will cause GSI Group, Inc. to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its income, but it generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on certain U.S.-sourced passive income items, such as dividends and certain types of interest.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure\nWe may require additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may require additional capital to adequately respond to future business challenges or opportunities, including, but not limited to, the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, maintaining or expanding research and development projects, the need to build inventory or to invest other cash to support business growth, and opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding debt of $115.0 million under the amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the \u201cAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) and $95.0 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our needs exceed the amounts available under the Senior Credit Facilities, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to obtain additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of the holders of our common shares. Further, our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts our ability to obtain additional debt financing from other sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our common shares.\nGlobal credit conditions have varied widely over the last several years and could continue to vary significantly in the future. Although these conditions have not affected our current plans, adverse credit conditions in the future could have a negative impact on our ability to execute on future strategic activities.\nThe market price for our common shares may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common shares could be subject to wide fluctuations. These fluctuations could be caused by:\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates by analysts;\n\u00b7\nconditions in the markets we serve; or\n\u00b7\ngeneral market or economic conditions.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common shares.\nWe may not have access to the cash flow and other assets of our subsidiaries that may be needed to service our indebtedness and fund our operations.\nAlthough much of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries, none of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us. Accordingly, our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and fund our operations may be dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness may restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary.\nCertain significant shareholders could have substantial influence over our Board of Directors and our outstanding common shares, which could limit our other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key transactions.\nOur largest shareholders and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own a substantial amount of our outstanding common shares. As a result, these shareholders may be able to influence matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, or other extraordinary transactions. One of these shareholders also serves on our Board of Directors and therefore could have a substantial influence over our Board of Directors. These significant shareholders may have interests that differ from other shareholders and may vote in a way that may be adverse to the interests of other shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nOur corporate documents and our existence as a corporation under the laws of New Brunswick subject us to provisions of Canadian law that may enable our Board of Directors to resist a change in control of the Company. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nlimitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to issue an unlimited number of common shares; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures required for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of shareholders.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions that shareholders desire. In addition, New Brunswick law provides that cumulative voting is mandatory in director elections which can result in stockholders holding less than a majority of shares being able to elect persons to the Board of Directors and prevent a majority stockholder from controlling the election of all of the directors.\nOur existing indebtedness could adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $115.0 million of outstanding debt. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u00b7\nreducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, market changes in the industries in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our borrowings thereunder.\nRisks Relating to Our Internal Controls\nIf we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which may adversely affect our stock price and our business.\nWhile our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014, it is possible that material weaknesses may be identified in the future.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our business. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may make additional acquisitions of privately held businesses. Prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, the acquired business would not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies. We are required to integrate the acquired businesses into our consolidated company\u2019s system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take for our recently acquired business or any business that we may acquire in the future. Additionally, we may need to improve our internal control or those of any business we acquire and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls in order to make such improvements. This could result in significant costs to us and could require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities.", "PERMNO": 82261, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "NOVT"}
