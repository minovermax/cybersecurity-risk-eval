{"cik": "314203", "company": "McEwen Mining Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis report, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements that may be affected by several risk factors. The following information summarizes all material risks known to us as of the date of filing this report:\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nWe have incurred substantial losses since our inception in 1979 and may never be profitable.\nSince our inception in 1979, we have never been profitable. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit, including non-cash impairment charges, was $919.6 million, including a net loss of $311.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the future, our ability to become profitable will depend on the profitability of the San Jos\u00e9 and El Gallo 1 mines, our ability to bring the El Gallo 2 and Gold Bar projects into production and generate revenue sufficient to cover our costs and expenses, and our ability to advance, sell or otherwise monetize our other properties, including the Los Azules copper project. In pursuit of that objective, we will seek to identify additional mineralization that can be extracted economically at operating and exploration properties. For our non-operating properties that we believe demonstrate economic potential, we need to either develop our properties, locate and enter into agreements with third party operators, or sell the properties. We may suffer significant additional losses in the future and may never be profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding on favorable terms to develop additional mining operations.\nWe will need to obtain additional financing, either in the form of debt or equity financing, to fund development of additional mining operations such as the El Gallo 2 or Gold Bar projects and to continue our administrative activities. Our working capital balance, along with expected cash generated from mining operations at El Gallo 1 and any dividends received from MSC, is not expected to be sufficient to allow us to develop El Gallo 2, the next anticipated mine project, or to continue our operations indefinitely. Our ability to obtain necessary funding, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including the state of the economy and applicable commodity prices. We may not be successful in obtaining the required financing for El Gallo 2 or other purposes, on terms that are favorable to us or at all, in which case, our ability to continue operating would be adversely affected. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further exploration or potential development and the possible partial or total loss of our interest in certain properties.\nThe feasibility of mining at our El Gallo and Gold Bar properties has not been established in accordance with Industry Guide 7, and any funds spent by us on exploration and development could be lost.\nA \"reserve,\" as defined by Industry Guide 7 of the SEC, is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. A reserve requires a SEC-compliant feasibility study or other report demonstrating with reasonable certainty that the deposit can be economically extracted and produced. Since we have not received a SEC-compliant report on any of our properties, we currently have no reserves as defined by Industry Guide 7, except for our 49% interest in the San Jos\u00e9 mine, and there are no assurances that we will be able to prove that there are reserves on our properties.\nThe mineralized material identified on our properties, including the El Gallo 1 mine where we are currently in production, does not and may never demonstrate economic viability. Substantial expenditures are required to establish reserves through drilling and additional study and there is no assurance that reserves will be established. The feasibility of mining at El Gallo, Gold Bar, or any other property has not been, and may never be, established. Whether a mineral deposit can be commercially viable depends upon a number of factors, including the particular attributes of the deposit, including size, grade, metallurgical recoveries and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which can be highly variable; and government regulations, including environmental and reclamation obligations. If we are unable to establish some or all of our mineralized material as proven or probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations, our investment in that property may be lost, and the market value of our securities may suffer.\nWe are required to prepare and file with the Canadian securities regulators estimates of mineralized material in accordance with NI 43-101. These standards are substantially different from the standards generally permitted to report reserve and other estimates in reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Under NI 43-101, we report measured, indicated and inferred resources, measurements which are generally not permitted in filings made with the SEC. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources reported in our Canadian filings will ever be converted into Industry Guide 7 compliant reserves.\nThere are significant risks and uncertainty associated with construction, commencing or expanding production or changing production plans without a current feasibility, pre-feasibility or scoping study. As such, the El Gallo Complex and Gold Bar properties may ultimately be determined to lack one or more geological, engineering, legal, operating, economic, social, environmental, and other relevant factors reasonably required to serve as the basis for a final decision to successfully complete all or part of these projects.\nThe figures for our estimated mineralized material are based on interpretation and assumptions and may yield less mineral production under actual conditions than is currently estimated.\nUnless otherwise indicated, mineralization figures presented in our filings with securities regulatory authorities including the SEC, news releases and other public statements that may be made from time to time are based upon estimates made by independent geologists and our internal geologists. When making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects to development, we must rely upon such estimated calculations as to the mineralized material and grades of mineralization on our properties. Until ore is actually mined and processed, mineralized material and grades of mineralization must be considered as estimates only.\nThese estimates are imprecise and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unreliable. We cannot ensure that:\n\u2022 these estimates will be accurate;\n\u2022 mineralization estimates will be accurate; or\n\u2022 this mineralization can be mined or processed profitably.\nAny material changes in mineral estimates and grades of mineralization may affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and such property's return on capital. There can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale tests will be recovered in large-scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale. The estimates contained in our public filings have been determined and valued based on assumed future prices, cut-off grades and operating costs that may prove to be inaccurate. Extended declines in market prices for gold and/or silver may render portions of our mineralization estimates uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or adversely affect the commercial viability of one or more of our properties. Any material reductions in estimates of mineralization, or of our ability to extract this mineralization, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe own our 49% interest in the San Jos\u00e9 mine and the other 51% is owned Hochschild Mining plc., under the terms of an option and joint venture agreement (\"OJVA\"), and therefore we are unable to control all aspects of the exploration and development of and production from this property.\nOur interest in the San Jos\u00e9 mine is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures. A disagreement between joint venture partners on how to conduct business efficiently, the inability of joint venture partners to meet their obligations to the joint venture or third parties, or litigation arising between joint venture partners regarding joint venture matters could have a material adverse effect on the viability of our interests held through the joint venture.\nOur operations in Argentina and Mexico are subject to changes in political conditions, regulations and crime.\nAlthough all of our operations are subject to changes in political conditions, regulations and crime, the Company has substantial investments in Argentina and Mexico and is therefore subject to risks normally associated with the conduct of business in foreign countries. Further, both Argentina and Mexico have undergone significant government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, importation of parts and supplies, income and other taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety. Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates may adversely affect the Company's operations or profitability. There also is the risk of political violence and increased social tension in both Mexico and Argentina as these countries have experienced periods of crime, and civil and labor unrest. Certain political and economic events such as acts, or failures to act, by a government authorities in Argentina and Mexico, and acts of political violence could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate in the country.\nWith respect to our San Jos\u00e9 mine, there are risks relating to an uncertain or unpredictable political and economic environment in Argentina. For instance, Argentina defaulted on foreign debt repayments and on the repayment on a number of official loans to multinational organizations in 2002 and 2003, and defaulted again on its bonds in 2014 after failing to reach an agreement with certain of its bondholders. In 2008, the Argentine government also reassessed its policy and practice in respect of export duties and began levying export duties on mining companies operating in the country. In 2012, Argentina's President announced the nationalization of the majority stake of Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales (YPF), Argentina's largest oil company. In 2013, Argentina's federal Income Tax Statute was amended to include a 10% income tax withholding on dividend distributions by Argentine corporations, and the capital gains exception for non-resident taxpayers was repealed. Although these particular changes have not affected the San Jos\u00e9 mine, there can be no assurance that the Argentine government will not unilaterally take other action which could have a material adverse effect on our projects in the country or that Argentina will continue to honor any fiscal agreements or tax stability rights provided to MSC.\nThere also exist current restrictions to imports and provisions relating to local sourcing of transports and substitution of imports of goods and services. These measures may impact the quality and supply of products and services required for our Argentine operations, including specifically the San Jos\u00e9 mine. Other unanticipated changes by the Argentine government could adversely impact the profitability of the San Jos\u00e9 mine or affect our ability to explore or develop all or part of our Los Azules project or other exploration properties in Argentina. Political and economic events such as acts, or failures to act, by a government authority in Argentina, and acts of political violence in Argentina, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate.\nWith respect to our El Gallo 1 mine in Mexico, in recent years, there has been a marked increase in the level of violence and crime relating to drug cartels in Sinaloa state, where we operate, and in other regions of Mexico. This may disrupt our ability to carry out exploration and mining activities and affect the safety and security of our employees and contractors. Our exploration and mining activities may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions, including as a result of periodic elections, that could increase the costs related to our activities or maintaining our properties.\nLegislation has been enacted that significantly and adversely affects the mining industry.\nIn Argentina, in June 2013, the Province of Santa Cruz passed amendments to the Provincial Tax Code and Provincial Tax Law, which imposes a new tax on mining reserves in the Province. The law came into effect on July 5, 2013. The tax will amount to 1% of the value of mine reserves reported in feasibility studies and financial statements inclusive of variations resulting from ongoing operations. Regulations require that the tax be calculated on \"measured\" reserves, and MSC has interpreted this to mean \"proven\" reserves. The Province has not disputed this interpretation but has not provided further clarification on the definition of \"measured\" reserves, and the outcome is not clear at the time. MSC has filed a legal claim disputing the legality of the new tax and has paid the initial installments under protest.\nIn Mexico, in October 2013, the Mexican lower house passed a bill proposing a tax-deductible mining royalty of 7.5% on earnings before the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, along with an additional 0.5% on precious metals revenue for precious metals mining companies. In addition the long term corporate tax rate is expected to remain at 30% rather than being reduced to 28% as originally planned. The Mexican Senate approved the provisions of the Tax Reform on October 31, 2013. The effective date of the law was effective January 1, 2014.\nPeriodically, members of the U.S. Congress have introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the General Mining Law of 1872, which governs the unpatented claims that we control with respect to our U.S. properties. One such amendment has become law and has imposed a moratorium on the patenting of mining claims, which reduced the security of title provided by unpatented claims such as those on our U.S. properties. If additional legislation is enacted, it could substantially increase the cost of holding unpatented mining claims by requiring payment of royalties, and could significantly impair our ability to develop mineral estimates on unpatented mining claims. Such bills have proposed, among other things, to make permanent the patent moratorium, to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims and to declare certain lands as unsuitable for mining. Although it is impossible to predict at this time what royalties may be imposed in the future, the imposition of such royalties could adversely affect the potential for development of such mining claims, and the economics of existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims. Passage of such legislation could adversely affect our business.\nRecent Argentine foreign exchange regulations and export revenue repatriation requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and operations.\nIn October 2011, Argentina announced a decree under which a previously granted exemption was eliminated, therefore requiring mining companies to repatriate mining revenues to Argentine currency before distributing revenue either locally or overseas. Fluctuation in the value of the Argentine peso as a result of the repatriation requirement and the repatriation requirement may create inefficiencies in our ability to transfer our revenue from Argentina and result in substantial transaction costs. Further, there are additional transaction costs imposed by the central bank for transferring funds from and within Argentina.\nIn April 2012, Argentina announced further rules which initially reduced the number of days mining companies have to repatriate funds relating to exports sales to 15 days and then subsequently in July 2012, relaxed the repatriation requirement to 79 days on the export of dor\u00e9 and 180 days on the sale of concentrates for certain mining companies including MSC which operates the San Jos\u00e9 mine.\nFurther, under current regulations, Argentine residents, including MSC, are not allowed to purchase in the foreign exchange market relevant amounts of foreign currency without a specific purpose, which includes foreign currency to be held in Argentina and other cross-border transfers. While Argentine companies may freely acquire and transfer foreign currency abroad to pay profits and dividends to foreign shareholders (provided that they relate to final and audited financial statements), in an attempt to stop capital flight and control the dollar, the government has continued restricting, by means of a \"de facto\" measure, the transfer of dividends abroad.\nThese restrictions and any additional restrictions on the Argentine foreign exchange regime or export repatriation requirements could affect our liquidity and operations in Argentina, and our ability to access such funds.\nOur business is subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage, and often carry substantial penalties. There can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company's affiliates, employees or agents. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company's reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risk.\nWhile we transact most of our business in U.S. dollars, expenses, such as labor, operating supplies, and property and equipment, are denominated in Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos or Argentine pesos. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies against the U.S. dollar increases costs and the cost of purchasing property and equipment in U.S. dollar terms in Mexico, Argentina and Canada, which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Conversely, a depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies usually\ndecreases operating costs and property and equipment purchases in U.S. dollar terms in foreign countries.\nThe value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates. Appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a depreciation in non-U.S. dollar currencies results in a loss. We have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We also hold portions of our cash reserves in Canadian, Mexican and Argentine currency.\nFluctuating precious metals and copper prices could negatively impact our business.\nThe potential for profitability of our gold and silver mining operations and the value of our mining properties are directly related to the market price of gold, silver and copper. The price of gold, silver and copper may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock. The market price of gold and silver historically has fluctuated significantly, including a significant downward trend from 2012 to 2014, and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include supply and demand fundamentals, expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold and silver sales and loans by central banks, forward sales by metal producers, accumulation and divestiture by exchange traded funds, global or regional political, economic or banking crises, and a number of other factors. The market price of silver is also affected by industrial demand. The selection of a property for exploration or development, the determination to construct a mine and place it into production, and the dedication of funds necessary to achieve such purposes are decisions that must be made long before the first revenues, if any, from production will be received. Price fluctuations between the time that such decisions are made and the commencement of production can have a material adverse effect on the economics of a mine.\nThe volatility of mineral prices represents a substantial risk which no amount of planning or technical expertise can fully eliminate. In the event mineral prices decline and remain low for prolonged periods of time, we might be unable to develop our properties, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows. Our results of operations have been and could continue to be materially and adversely affected by the impairment of assets. An asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our producing properties or the market value of our non-producing properties. The deteriorating economic outlook for companies in the mineral exploration and extraction sector and declines in commodity prices are likely to reduce the recoverable amount of our investment in MSC, El Gallo 1 mine, and other, non-producing mineral property interests including the Los Azules project, and therefore may increase our impairment charges in the future.\nThe volatility in gold, silver and copper prices is illustrated by the following table, which sets forth, for the periods indicated, the average market prices in U.S. dollars per ounce of gold and silver, based on the average daily London P.M. fix, and per pound of copper based on the London Metal Exchange Grade A copper settlement price.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2014, and as of the date of this report, mineral prices have continued to experience a downward trend, especially with respect to silver and copper. As at March 2, 2015, gold, silver and copper prices were of $1,241 per ounce, $17.22 per ounce, and $2.58 per pound,\nrespectively. Should these downward trends continue, there is a possibility that we may record additional impairment charges in 2015 or future years.\nIncreased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability.\nCosts at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing-related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete and mining and processing-related equipment and facilities. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures have escalated on an industry-wide basis over the last several years, as a result of factors beyond our control, including the prices of oil, steel and other commodities and labor, as well as the demand for certain mining and processing equipment. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects.\nOur estimated timetables to achieve production for the El Gallo 2 and Gold Bar properties may not be accurate.\nThe final decision to proceed with the construction of our El Gallo 2 project, for which a feasibility study was completed in 2012, has not been made. The Company plans to complete its cost savings studies and review financing alternatives. Any decision to proceed would be based on silver prices and securing financing on terms that we believe are more favorable to us than those that were available to us at the time of filing this report. With respect to the Gold Bar project, based on the 2012 preliminary feasibility study, we believe production may be achieved in 2016. However, the Gold Bar preliminary feasibility study is preliminary in nature and is subject to change due to factors within and outside of our control. There is no certainty that the economics estimated in the preliminary feasibility study will be realized or that we will be able to begin production within the timelines estimated, if at all.\nFurther, we may also be unable to obtain the necessary permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or on terms that provide us sufficient resources to develop our properties. These and other factors may cause us to delay production at El Gallo 2 and our Gold Bar properties beyond our current expectations, or cancel our plans entirely.\nDevelopment at Los Azules presents development challenges that may negatively affect, if not completely negate, the feasibility of development of the property.\nThe Los Azules property is located in a remote location that is accessed by 75 miles (120 kilometers) of unimproved dirt road with eight river crossings and two mountain passes both above 13,451 feet (4,100 meters). Even assuming that technical difficulties associated with this remote location can be overcome, the capital costs may make the project uneconomical. According to a new NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") filed on November 7, 2013 with an effective date of August 1, 2013, capital costs were estimated to be $3.9 billion initially and $5.5 billion over the life of the mine with an accuracy target of plus or minus 35%. In order for Los Azules to be economically feasible for development, the price of copper would have to achieve and remain at a level high enough\nto justify the high capital costs estimated for the project. There can be no assurance that these capital cost estimates are accurate, given the inflationary pressure in the mining industry and in Argentina in particular. If the long term price of copper were to remain low or decrease significantly below the current price or capital cost estimates increase significantly, Los Azules may not be feasible for development, and we may have to write-off the remaining carrying value of the asset. Furthermore, the project's economic feasibility has not yet been demonstrated through a full feasibility study. The PEA is preliminary in nature, includes NI 43-101 mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would allow them to be categorized as mineral reserves either under Industry Guide 7 or NI 43-101, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. Finally, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to develop the property; we may not receive the required permits or environmental approvals; we may not be able to construct the necessary power and infrastructure assets; and, we may not be able to attract qualified workers to build such a project, any of which could result in the delay or indefinite postponement of development at the property. Such a result would have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nWe may acquire additional exploration stage properties and we may face negative reactions if reserves are not located on acquired properties.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire additional exploration stage properties. There can be no assurance that we have or will be able to complete the acquisition of such properties at reasonable prices or on favorable terms and that reserves will be identified on any properties that we acquire. We may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions of additional properties or if reserves are not located on acquired properties. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock or our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses that could materially and adversely affect our operations.\nExploration for and production of minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization, and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined. Few properties that are explored are ultimately advanced to production. Our current exploration efforts are, and future development and mining operations we conduct will be, subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral properties, such as, but not limited to:\n\u2022 economically insufficient mineralized material;\n\u2022 fluctuations in production costs that may make mining uneconomical;\n\u2022 availability of labor, contractors, engineers, power, transportation and infrastructure;\n\u2022 labor disputes;\n\u2022 potential delays related to social, public health, and community issues;\n\u2022 unanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems;\n\u2022 environmental hazards;\n\u2022 water conditions;\n\u2022 difficult surface or underground conditions;\n\u2022 industrial accidents;\n\u2022 metallurgical and other processing problems;\n\u2022 mechanical and equipment performance problems;\n\u2022 failure of pit walls or dams;\n\u2022 unusual or unexpected rock formations;\n\u2022 personal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins and landslides; and\n\u2022 decrease in reserves or mineralized material due to a lower silver, gold or copper price.\nAny of these risks can materially and adversely affect, among other things, the development of properties, production quantities and rates, costs and expenditures, potential revenues and production dates. We currently have no insurance to guard against any of these risks, except in very limited circumstances. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a write-down of our investment in these interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable.\nWe do not insure against all risks to which we may be subject in our operations.\nWhile we currently maintain insurance to insure against general commercial liability claims and physical assets at our properties in Argentina, Mexico, and the United States, we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks associated with our operations. Our other exploration projects have no existing infrastructure for which we insure. We may also be unable to obtain insurance to cover other risks at economically feasible premiums or at all. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available, or may not be adequate to cover liabilities. We might also become subject to liability for environmental, pollution or other hazards associated with mineral exploration and production which may not be insured against, which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or which we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these events may cause us to incur significant costs that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our property. A significant loss could force us to reduce or terminate our operations.\nShortages of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.\nThe mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules.\nOur operations are subject to permitting requirements which could require us to delay, suspend or terminate our operations on our mining properties.\nOur mining operations, including ongoing exploration drilling programs, require permits from the state and federal governments, including permits for the use of water and for drilling wells for water. We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or on terms that provide us sufficient resources to develop our properties, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain such permits, the time required by the permitting process can be significant. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration of our properties will be adversely affected, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and market price of our securities.\nTitle to mineral properties can be uncertain, and we are at risk of loss of ownership of one or more of our properties.\nOur ability to explore and operate our properties depends on the validity of our title to that property. Our U.S. mineral properties include leases of unpatented mining claims, as well as unpatented mining and millsite claims which we control directly. Unpatented mining claims provide only possessory title and their validity is often subject to contest by third parties or the federal government, which makes the validity of unpatented mining claims uncertain and generally more risky. Our concessions in Mexico are subject to continuing government regulation and failure to adhere to such regulations will result in termination of the concession. Similarly, under Argentine Law, failure to comply with applicable conditions may result in the termination of the concession. Uncertainties inherent in mineral properties relate to such things as the sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper posting and marking of boundaries, assessment work and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from public record. We have not obtained title opinions covering our entire property, with the attendant risk that title to some claims, particularly title to undeveloped property, may be defective. There may be valid challenges to the title to our property which, if successful, could impair development and/or operations.\nWe cannot ensure that we will have an adequate supply of water to complete desired exploration or development of our mining properties.\nOur mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in Argentina, Mexico and the United States are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company's control.\nOur continuing reclamation obligations at Tonkin, El Gallo and other properties could require significant additional expenditures.\nWe are responsible for the reclamation obligations related to disturbances located on all of our properties, including the Tonkin Complex. We have posted a surety bond in the amount of the estimated reclamation obligation at the Tonkin Complex. We submitted a mine closure plan to the BLM for the Tonkin Complex during the fourth quarter of 2010. The closure plan for the Tonkin mine is currently undergoing an environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The plan was accepted by the NDEP in March 2012 but is still under review by the BLM pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. It is possible that reclamation plan cost estimates and bonding requirements may increase as a result of this review. The Company, however, is unable to meaningfully estimate possible increases at this time. We have not posted a bond in Mexico relating to the El Gallo Complex, as none is required but have recorded a liability based on the estimated amount of our reclamation obligations. There is a risk that any surety bond or recorded liability, even if increased based on the analysis and work performed to update the reclamation obligations, could be inadequate to cover the actual costs of reclamation when carried out. The satisfaction of bonding requirements and continuing reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital. There is a risk that we will be unable to fund these additional bonding requirements, that the surety bonds may no longer be accepted by the governmental agencies as satisfactory reclamation coverage, in which case we would be required to replace the surety bonding with cash, and further, that the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation and bonding requirements to such a degree that it would not be commercially\nreasonable to continue exploration activities, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows.\nOur ongoing operations and past mining activities are subject to environmental risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay, suspension or termination of our operations.\nAll phases of our operations are subject to Argentine, Mexican and American federal, state and local environmental regulation. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, including cyanide. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for us and our officers, directors and employees. Future changes in environmental regulation, if any, may adversely affect our operations, make our operations prohibitively expensive, or prohibit them altogether. Environmental hazards may exist on our properties that are unknown to us at the present and that have been caused by us, or previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally. Mining properties from the companies we have acquired may cause us to be liable for remediating any damage that those companies may have caused. The liability could include response costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources, including ground water, as well as the payment of fines and penalties. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permitting requirements may also result in enforcement actions thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities, causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions.\nWe have transferred our interest in several mining properties over past years, some of which are now being operated by third parties. Under applicable U.S. federal and state environmental laws, as prior owner of these properties, we may be liable for remediating any damage that we may have caused. The liability could include response costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources, including ground water, as well as the payment of fines and penalties.\nDue to an increased level of non-governmental organization activity targeting the mining industry, the potential for the government to delay the issuance of permits or impose new requirements or conditions upon mining operations may be increased. Any changes in government policies may be costly to comply with and may delay mining operations. Future changes in such laws and regulations, if any, may adversely affect our operations, make our operations prohibitively expensive, or prohibit them altogether. If our interests are materially adversely affected as a result of a violation of applicable laws, regulations, or permitting requirements or a change in applicable law or regulations, it would have a significant negative impact on the value of our company and could have a significant impact on our stock price.\nGlobal climate change is an international concern, and could impact our ability to conduct future operations.\nGlobal climate change is an international issue and receives a substantial amount of publicity. We would expect that the imposition of international treaties or Argentina, Mexican, and American federal, state, provincial or local laws or regulations pertaining to mandatory reductions in energy consumption or emissions of greenhouse gasses could affect the feasibility of our mining projects and increase our operating costs.\nOur industry is highly competitive, attractive mineral lands are scarce, and we may not be able to obtain quality properties.\nWe compete with many companies in the mining industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel and financial resources. There is a limited supply of\ndesirable mineral lands available for claim staking, lease or acquisition in Argentina, Mexico and the United States, and other areas where we may conduct exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. From time to time, specific properties or areas which would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition may be unavailable to us due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources. Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such properties. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious metals, but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world-wide basis. Such competition may result in our Company being unable not only to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur lack of operating experience may cause us difficulty in managing our growth.\nOur management team, as a whole, has limited experience in developing and operating a mine. We are currently working towards the development of El Gallo 2 in Mexico and our Gold Bar project in Nevada. If we are unable to successfully finance and place these projects into production, our stock price may suffer and you may lose some or all of your investment. Our ability to manage the anticipated growth that we expect will accompany placing one or more of those properties into production will require us to improve and expand our management and our operational systems and controls. If our management is unable to manage growth effectively, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed. In addition, if rapid growth occurs, it may strain our operational, managerial and financial resources.\nTo the extent that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.\nFrom time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to provide increased returns to our shareholders and to expand our operations and reported reserves and, potentially, generate synergies. The success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 Identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u2022 Obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially the Company's shareholders;\n\u2022 Maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business;\n\u2022 Implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and\n\u2022 To the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully, or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.\nA significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors, including specifically our mining contractor at the El Gallo 1 mine. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022 Negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 The inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u2022 Reduced control and oversight over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n\u2022 Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n\u2022 Interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u2022 Failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n\u2022 Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other related employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe depend on a limited number of personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business.\nOur company is dependent on key management, namely our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Operating Officer; our Managing Director, our Vice President, Argentina; our Vice President, Projects; our Vice President, Corporate Development; and our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. Robert R. McEwen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for strategic direction and the oversight of our business. Nathan Stubina, our Managing Director; William Faust, our Chief Operating Officer; Simon Quick, our Vice President, Projects; and Andrew Elinesky, our Vice President, Argentina, oversee project development in Mexico, Nevada and Argentina. Perry Y. Ing, our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for our public reporting and administrative functions. Craig Stanley, our Vice President, Corporate Development, is responsible for corporate development activities, including the evaluation of potential transactions. Nils F. Engelstad, our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, is responsible for overseeing the legal and corporate affairs of our Company. We rely heavily on these individuals for the conduct of our business. The loss of any of these officers may significantly and adversely affect our business. In that event, we would be forced to identify and retain an individual to replace the departed officer. We may not be able to replace one or more of these individuals on terms acceptable to us. We have no life insurance on the life of any officer.\nSome of our directors may have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies.\nSome of our directors are directors or officers of other natural resource or mining-related companies, or may be involved in related pursuits that could present conflicts of interest with their roles at our Company. These associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. In the event that any such conflict of interest arises, a director who has such a conflict is required to disclose the conflict to the other directors and may be required to abstain from voting on the matter.\nThe laws of the State of Colorado, our Articles of Incorporation and agreements with certain officers and directors may protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits.\nThe laws of the State of Colorado provide that our directors will not be liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors of the Company. Our Articles of Incorporation permit us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law, including through stand-alone indemnity agreements. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our executive officers and directors which require that we indemnify them against certain liabilities incurred by them in their capacity as such. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing shareholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.\nWe are currently the subject of an inquiry by the SEC Division of Enforcement with respect to the accounting treatment of Los Azules.\nWe are currently the subject of an inquiry by the SEC's Division of Enforcement requesting certain information from us (the \"Inquiry\"). The Inquiry commenced in late November 2013. The SEC has stated that the Inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violation of law has occurred, nor should it be considered a reflection on any person, entity or security. Based on our assessment of the questions asked and documents requested by the SEC, we believe the Inquiry concerns the accounting treatment of the Company's Los Azules project for the period ending June 30, 2013 (\"Q2 2013\") and specifically why the Los Azules project was not classified as \"held for sale\" pursuant to ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and why we did not record an impairment relating to Los Azules during Q2 2013, at which time the Company's precious metals assets in Argentina were impaired and during which time the Company was engaging in a sales process for the Los Azules project.\nThe Company conducts a review of potential impairment triggers for all its mineral projects on a quarterly basis. The Company found no indicators of impairment in Q1 2013. In Q2 2013, there were adverse changes in the economic environment for mining companies, which was considered to be an indicator of impairment under ASC 360-10-35-21a. Consequently, the Company performed impairment tests for all its Argentine assets, including Los Azules. The results of the impairment tests indicated that, although certain of our precious metal assets in Argentina were impaired, there was no impairment for Los Azules. In Q3 2013, no indicators of impairment were identified for Los Azules. For Q4 2013, annual impairment testing was performed on all assets and no impairment of Los Azules was recorded. In Q1 2014, no indicators of impairment were identified for Los Azules. In Q2 2014, as described in Note 6, Mineral Property Interests and Asset Retirement Obligations, indicators of impairment for Los Azules were identified due to the sale of Lumina Copper Corp.'s Taca Taca copper project to First Quantum Minerals Ltd. The Company consequently recorded an impairment charge of $120.4 million relating to Los Azules during Q2 2014. In Q3 2014, no indicators of impairment were identified for Los Azules. For Q4 2014, annual impairment testing was performed on all assets. The Company noted a further decline in the observed market value of comparable transactions, which the Company considered to be an indicator of impairment. As a result, the Company recorded an additional impairment of $107.9 million in Q4 2014. Refer to Note 6, Mineral Property Interests and Asset Retirement Obligations for further details.\nThe Company believes that the \"asset held for sale\" criteria under ASC 360 were never satisfied for Los Azules in any of the periods presented above. In addition, our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were audited by our independent registered public accounting firm,\nKPMG LLP, who issued an unqualified opinion on our 2014 and 2013 annual consolidated financial statements.\nWe have cooperated fully and intend to continue to cooperate fully with the SEC. Following a meeting with the SEC in Washington, DC on April 7, 2014, we delivered our responses to the SEC's third request for documents in late April 2014. On September 30, 2014, we received a fourth request for documents. We delivered our responses to that request on October 30, 2014. At this point, we are unable to predict what, if any, consequences the Inquiry may have on us. However, the Inquiry may continue to result in considerable legal expenses and divert management's attention from other business concerns. If the SEC were to commence legal action, we could be required to pay significant penalties or other amounts and could become subject to injunctions, an administrative cease and desist order or other equitable remedies. The resolution of the Inquiry could require the filing of restatements of our prior financial statements or require that we take other actions not presently contemplated. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of the Inquiry, and the outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to litigation risks.\nAll industries, including the mining industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit. Defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding, including regulatory proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nA small number of existing shareholders own a significant portion of McEwen Mining common stock, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote.\nAs of March 2, 2015, Mr. McEwen beneficially owned approximately 25%, or 75.2 million shares, of the 300.1 million shares of McEwen Mining common stock (assuming all outstanding Exchangeable shares not held by McEwen Mining or its subsidiaries are exchanged for an equivalent amount of McEwen Mining common stock). Under our Articles of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Colorado, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present is generally required to approve most shareholder action. As a result, Mr. McEwen will be able to significantly influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or proposed mergers, acquisitions or other significant corporate transactions.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment.\nIn addition to other risk factors identified herein and to volatility associated with equity securities in general, the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022 Changes in the worldwide price for gold, silver and/or copper;\n\u2022 Volatility in the equities markets;\n\u2022 Disappointing results from our exploration or production efforts;\n\u2022 Producing at rates lower than those targeted;\n\u2022 Political and regulatory risks;\n\u2022 Weather conditions, including unusually heavy rains;\n\u2022 Failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u2022 Decline in demand for our common stock;\n\u2022 Downward revisions in securities analysts' estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u2022 Technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u2022 Investor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u2022 Actions by government central banks; and\n\u2022 General economic trends.\nDuring the 2014 calendar year the price of our stock has ranged from a low of $0.92 to a high of $3.56. In addition, stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile. These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares at a desired price.\nWe have never paid a dividend on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying one in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid a dividend on our common stock to date, and we do not expect to be in a position to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any earnings from the San Jos\u00e9 mine will likely be retained to finance our growth. Any future dividends will depend upon any future earnings, our then-existing financial requirements and other factors, and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nGain recognized by non-U.S. holders and non-U.S. persons holding any interest in the Company other than solely as a creditor (including, for example, interests in the form of our convertible debt, if any) on the sale or other disposition of our securities may be subject to U.S. federal income tax.\nWe believe that we currently are a \"United States real property holding corporation\" under section 897(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), or USRPHC, and that there is a substantial likelihood that we will continue to be a USRPHC in the future. Subject to certain exceptions, securities (other than securities that provide no interest in a corporation other than solely as a creditor) issued by a corporation that has been a USRPHC at any time during the preceding five years (or the non-U.S. holder's holding period for such securities, if shorter) are treated as U.S. real property interests, or USRPIs, and a gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder on the sale or other disposition of a USRPI is subject to regular U.S. federal income tax, on a net basis at graduated rates, as if such gain were effectively connected with the conduct by such holder of a U.S. trade or business. If gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder from the sale or other disposition of McEwen Mining common stock or other securities is subject to regular net basis income tax under these rules, the transferee of such McEwen Mining common stock or other securities may be required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10% of the gross amount paid to the non-U.S. holder with respect to the sale or other disposition, unless certain exceptions apply. Any tax withheld may be credited against the U.S. federal income tax owed by the non-U.S. holder for the year in which the sale or other disposition occurs.\nThe exercise of options and the future issuances of McEwen Mining common stock will dilute current shareholders and may reduce the market price of McEwen Mining common stock.\nUnder certain circumstances, McEwen Mining's board of directors (the \"McEwen Mining Board\") has the authority to authorize the offer and sale of additional securities without the vote of or notice to existing shareholders. McEwen Mining may issue equity in the future in connection with acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. Based on the need for additional capital to fund expected growth, it is likely that we will issue additional securities to provide such capital and that such additional issuances may involve a significant number of shares of McEwen Mining common stock.\nIssuance of additional securities in the future will dilute the percentage interest of existing shareholders of McEwen Mining and may reduce the market price of McEwen Mining common stock and other securities.\nFurthermore, the sale of a significant amount of McEwen Mining common stock by any selling security holders, specifically Mr. Robert R. McEwen (\"Mr. McEwen\"), our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, may depress the price of McEwen Mining common stock. As a result, you may lose all or a portion of your investment.", "PERMNO": 70704, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "MUX"}
