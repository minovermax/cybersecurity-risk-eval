{"cik": "790703", "company": "TECH DATA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial position and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Before you buy our common stock or other securities, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. The risks that have been highlighted below are not the only risks of our business. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock or other securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are as follows:\nOur ability to earn profit is more challenging when sales slow from a down economy as a result of gross profit declining faster than cost reduction efforts taking effect.\nHigh levels of unemployment in some of the markets we serve, as well as austerity measures that may be implemented by governments in those markets, can constrain economic growth resulting in lower demand for the products and services we sell. When we experience a rapid decline in demand for products we experience more difficulty in achieving the gross profit and operating profit we desire due to the lower sales and increased pricing pressure. The economic environment may also result in changes in vendor terms and conditions, such as rebates, cash discounts and cooperative marketing efforts, which may also result in downward pressure on our gross profit. As a result, there is pressure to reduce the cost of operations in order to maximize operating profits. To the extent we cannot reduce costs to offset such decline in gross profits, our operating profits typically deteriorate. The benefits from cost reductions may also take longer to fully realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand. Should we experience a decline in operating profits, especially in Europe, the valuations we develop for purposes of our goodwill impairment test may be adversely affected, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Deterioration in the financial and credit markets heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delays in payment. Future deterioration in the credit markets could result in reduced availability of credit insurance to cover customer accounts. This, in turn, may result in our reducing the credit lines we provide to customers, thereby having a negative impact on our net sales.\nOur competitors can take more market share by reducing prices on vendor products that contribute the most to our profitability.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment. The technology distribution industry is characterized by intense competition, based primarily on product availability, credit terms and availability, price, effectiveness of information systems and e-commerce tools, speed of delivery, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, service and support. Our customers are not required to purchase any specific volume of products from us and may move business if pricing is reduced by competitors, resulting in lower sales. As a result, we must be extremely flexible in determining when to reduce price to maintain market share and sales volumes and when to allow our sales volumes to decline to maintain the quality of our profitability. The Company competes with a variety of regional, national and international wholesale distributors, some of which may have greater financial resources than the Company.\nWe are dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems, including system security breaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks, may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nThe Company is highly dependent upon its internal information and telecommunications systems to operate its business. Failures of our internal information or telecommunications systems may prevent us from taking customer orders, shipping products and billing customers. Sales may also be impacted if our customers are unable to access our pricing and product availability information.\nAdditionally, the IT security landscape is constantly changing with increasing risks of cybercrime including phishing, social engineering, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service attacks, or similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our systems that could cause critical data loss or the disclosure or use of personal or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose personally identifiable information or other confidential information which could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. If the Company were to experience a security breakdown, disruption or breach that compromised sensitive information, it could harm our relationships with vendors and customers. The occurrence of any of these events could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to ship products if our third party shipping companies cease operations temporarily or permanently.\nThe Company relies on arrangements with independent shipping companies for the delivery of its products from vendors and to customers. The failure or inability of these shipping companies to deliver products or the unavailability of their shipping services, even temporarily, may have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\nIf our vendors do not continue to provide price protection for inventory we purchase from them, our profit from the sale of that inventory may decline.\nIt is very typical in our industry that the value of inventory will decline as a result of price reductions by vendors or technological obsolescence. It is the policy of many of our vendors to protect distributors from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or the vendors' price reductions. Some vendors, however, may be unwilling or unable to pay the Company for price protection claims or products returned to them under purchase agreements. Moreover, industry practices are sometimes not embodied in written agreements and do not protect the Company in all cases from declines in inventory value. No assurance can be given that such practices to protect distributors will continue, that unforeseen new product developments will not adversely affect the Company or that the Company will be able to successfully manage its existing and future inventories.\nFailure to obtain adequate product supplies from our largest vendors, or terminations of a supply or services agreement, or a significant change in vendor terms or conditions of sale by our largest vendors may negatively affect our net sales and operating profit.\nThe Company receives a significant percentage of revenues from products it purchases from certain vendors, such as Apple, Inc., HP Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. These vendors have significant negotiating power over us and rapid, significant and adverse changes in sales terms and conditions, such as reducing the amount of price protection and return rights as well as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us, may reduce the profit we can earn on these vendors' products and result in loss of revenue and profitability. The Company's gross profit could be negatively impacted if the Company is unable to pass through the impact of these changes to the Company's customers or cannot develop systems to manage ongoing vendor programs. In addition, the Company's standard vendor distribution agreement permits termination without cause by either party upon 30 days notice. The loss of a relationship with any of the Company's key vendors, a change in their strategy (such as increasing direct sales), the merger or reorganization of significant vendors or significant changes in terms on their products may adversely affect the Company's business.\nWe conduct business in countries outside of the United States, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that result in losses in certain periods.\nApproximately 64%, 65% and 68% of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were generated in countries outside of the United States, which exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into short-term forward exchange or option contracts to hedge this risk. Nevertheless, volatile foreign currency exchange rates increase our risk of loss related to products purchased in a currency other than the currency in which those products are sold. While we maintain policies to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates, extreme fluctuations have resulted in our incurring losses in some countries. The realization of any or all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. The translation of the financial statements of foreign operations into U.S. dollars is also impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may positively or negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, the value of the Company's equity investment in foreign countries may fluctuate based upon changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These fluctuations, which are recorded in a cumulative translation adjustment account, may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when the Company made investments in the country. In addition, our local competitors in certain markets may have different purchasing models that provide them reduced foreign currency exposure compared to the Company. This may result in market pricing that the Company cannot meet without significantly lower profit on sales.\nWe have international operations which expose us to risks associated with conducting business in multiple jurisdictions.\nThe Company's international operations are subject to other risks such as the imposition of governmental controls, export license requirements, restrictions on the export of certain technology, political instability, trade restrictions, tariff changes, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws (in particular related to items such as duty and taxation), difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, longer collection periods and the impact of local economic conditions and practices. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") held a non-binding referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU would have and how such a withdrawal would affect the Company.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings in the jurisdictions in which we operate may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing Project, and has issued and will continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. Certain countries, including the United States, are evaluating their tax policies and regulations which could affect international business and may have an adverse effect on our overall tax rate, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance.\nIn addition, while the Company's labor force in the Americas is currently non-union, employees of certain European subsidiaries are subject to collective bargaining or similar arrangements. The Company does business in certain foreign countries where labor disruption is more common than is experienced in the United States and some of the freight carriers used by the Company are unionized. A labor strike by a group of the Company's employees, one of the Company's freight carriers, one of its vendors, a general strike by civil service employees or a governmental shutdown could have an adverse effect on the Company's business. Many of the products the Company sells are manufactured in countries other than the countries in which the Company's logistics centers are\nlocated. The inability to receive products into the logistics centers because of government action or labor disputes at critical ports of entry may have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\nWe may encounter difficulties in fully integrating TS into our business and may not fully achieve, or achieve within a reasonable time frame, expected strategic objectives and other expected benefits of the acquisition.\nThe success of the acquisition of TS will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and potential synergies and cost savings from the integration of TS with our existing business. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in the integration of TS with our own business, including distracting management from day-to-day operations, potential incompatibility of corporate cultures, and costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures. In addition, the process of integrating the operations of TS could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel or distribution partners. Any one or all of these factors may increase our operating costs or lower our anticipated financial performance. Our failure to fully integrate TS and achieve the expected benefits of the proposed acquisition of TS within a reasonable time frame or at all could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTS may underperform relative to our expectations.\nFollowing the acquisition of TS, we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and TS have achieved or might achieve separately. The business and financial performance of TS are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may be unable to achieve the same growth, revenues and profitability that TS has achieved in the past. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that may impact our financial position and subject us to financial and operating restrictions, decrease our access to capital, and / or increase our borrowing costs, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur business requires substantial capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed by trade creditors. We have historically relied upon cash generated from operations, bank credit lines, trade credit from vendors, proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and proceeds from debt offerings to satisfy our capital needs and to finance growth. The incurrence of debt under our Senior Notes and other credit facilities subject us to financial and operating covenants, which may limit our ability to borrow and our flexibility in responding to our business needs.\nAs of January 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.4 billion of total debt and in conjunction with the completion of the acquisition of TS, an additional $1.0 billion of debt has been incurred under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined herein). If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our overall leverage and terms of our financing could, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to obtain trade credit from vendors; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nChanges in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital.\nCertain of our financing instruments involve variable rate debt, thus exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. Increases in interest rates would result in an increase in the interest expense on our variable rate debt, which would reduce our profitability. In addition, the interest rate payable on the 3.70% Senior Notes and the 4.95% Senior Notes (each as defined herein) and certain other credit facilities would be subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit rating is downgraded.\nWe cannot predict what losses we might incur in litigation matters, regulatory enforcement actions and contingencies that we may be involved with from time to time, including in connection with the restatement of prior financial statements.\nThe SEC has requested information from the Company with respect to the restatement of certain of our consolidated financial statements and other financial information from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013, and the Company is cooperating with the SEC request. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d This pending SEC request for information and other potential proceedings could result in fines and other penalties. The Company has not reserved any amount in respect of these matters in its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company cannot predict whether monetary losses, if any, it experiences in any proceedings related to the restatement will be covered by insurance or whether insurance proceeds recovered will be sufficient to offset such losses. Potential civil or regulatory proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of the Company\u2019s management from business operations.\nThe Company cannot predict what losses we might incur from other litigation matters, regulatory enforcement actions and contingencies that we may be involved with from time to time, including in relation to claims that may arise related to the operations of TS prior to the date of the completion of the acquisition. There are various other claims, lawsuits and pending actions against us. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, the resolution of certain of these matters could be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending on the level of income for such period. We can make no assurances that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these other matters.", "PERMNO": 10182, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "TECD"}
