{"cik": "722256", "company": "HUDSON VALLEY HOLDING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur concentration of commercial real estate loans has resulted in increased scrutiny by the OCC, and we may be subject to future regulatory action and loss of business opportunity as a result.\nAs part of a routine safety and soundness exam conducted by the OCC during the fourth quarter of 2011, we were made aware that we would be required to reduce our concentrations in commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) and classified loans relative to tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan and lease losses. In response, we sold approximately $474 million in loans at the end of the first quarter of 2012, of which $27.8 million were nonperforming, and another $25.5 million were performing classified loans, a significant step toward reducing the Bank\u2019s concentrations of CRE loans and classified assets to less than 400 percent and 25 percent of tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan and lease losses, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the Bank\u2019s concentration of CRE loans and classified loans was 333.3 percent and 16.5 percent, respectively, of tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nWe can provide no assurances that we will not become subject to some form of administrative action in the future. These limitations and any future administrative actions may restrict our business opportunities and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, further deterioration in our loan portfolio, including further declines in the market values of real estate supporting certain CRE loans, would result in further provisions for loan losses in future periods, which would have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.\nFurther additions to our nonperforming loans may occur and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, our non-accrual loans totaled $22.4 million and $23.5 million, or 1.2% and 1.4% of the loan portfolio, respectively. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, our nonperforming assets (which include non-accrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, nonperforming loans held for sale and foreclosed real estate, also called other real estate owned) totaled $22.4 million and $23.5 million, or 0.7% and 0.8% of total assets, respectively. In addition, we had $7.9 million and $4.6 million of accruing loans that were 31-89 days delinquent at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDespite improvements in overall economic and market conditions, we expect to continue to incur additional losses relating to nonperforming loans. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. First, we do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing our loan administration costs. Second, when we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may result in a loss. Third, these loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the capital our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. Adverse changes in the value of our problem assets, or the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial conditions, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience further additions to nonperforming loans in the future, or that our nonperforming assets will not result in further losses in the future.\nAs regulated entities, the Company and the Bank are subject to extensive supervision and regulation, including maintaining certain capital requirements, which may limit their operations and potential growth. Failure to meet any such requirements would subject us to regulatory action.\nThe Company is supervised by the FRB and the Bank is supervised by the OCC. As such, each is subject to extensive supervision and prudential regulation, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements. The Company and the Bank must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by the FRB or the OCC, respectively that may change depending upon general economic conditions and the particular condition, risk profile and growth plans of the Company and the Bank.\nIn today\u2019s economic and regulatory environment, banking regulators, including the OCC, continue to direct greater scrutiny to banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans like us. As a general matter, such banks, including the Bank, are expected to maintain higher capital levels as well as other measures due to commercial real estate lending growth and exposures. If we do not maintain these higher capital levels, we may be subject to enforcement actions. More generally, compliance with capital requirements may limit loan growth or other operations that require the use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels.\nIf we fail to meet any regulatory capital requirement or are otherwise deemed to be operating in an unsafe and unsound manner or in violation of law, we may be subject to a variety of informal or formal remedial measures and enforcement actions. Such informal remedial measures and enforcement actions may include a memorandum of understanding which is initiated by the regulator and\noutlines an institution\u2019s agreement to take specified actions within specified time periods to correct violations of law or unsafe and unsound practices. In addition, as part of our regular examination process, regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Any of these restrictions, in whatever manner imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to informal remedial actions, we may also be subject to formal enforcement actions. Failure to comply with an informal enforcement action could cause us to be subject to formal enforcement actions. Formal enforcement actions include written agreements, cease and desist orders, the imposition of substantial fines and other civil penalties and, in the most severe cases, the termination of deposit insurance or the appointment of a conservator or receiver for our bank subsidiary. Furthermore, if the Bank fails to meet any regulatory capital requirement, it will be subject to the prompt corrective action framework of the FDICIA, which imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions as the capital category of an institution declines, up to and including, ultimately, the appointment of a conservator or receiver. A failure to meet regulatory capital requirements could also subject us to capital raising requirements. Additional capital raisings would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Common Stock\u201d for more information.\nAny remedial measure or enforcement action, whether formal or informal, could impose restrictions on our ability to operate our business and adversely affect our prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any formal enforcement action could harm our reputation and our ability to retain and attract customers and impact the trading price of our common stock.\nIncreases to the allowance for loan losses may cause our earnings to decrease.\nIn determining our loan loss reserves for each quarter, we make various assumptions and judgments about the future performance of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance and a corresponding decrease in income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeclines in value may adversely impact the carrying amount of our investment portfolio and result in other-than-temporary impairment charges.\nNumerous factors, including lack of liquidity for sales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, adverse changes in business climate or adverse actions by regulators could have a negative impact on the valuation of our investment portfolio in future periods. If an impairment charge is significant enough, it could affect the ability of the Bank to upstream dividends to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders, and could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in us not being classified as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for regulatory purposes.\nA prolonged or worsened downturn in the economy in general and the real estate market in our key market areas in particular would adversely affect our loan portfolio and our growth potential.\nOur primary lending market area is Westchester County, New York and New York City and to an increasing extent, Rockland County, New York, with a primary focus on businesses, professionals and not-for-profit organizations located in this area. Accordingly, the asset quality of our loan portfolio largely depends upon the area\u2019s economy and real estate markets. The Bank\u2019s primary lending market area and asset quality have been adversely affected by continued weakness in the economy. A prolonged or worsened downturn in the economy in our primary lending area would adversely affect our asset quality, operations and limit our future growth potential.\nIn particular, a downturn in our local real estate market could negatively affect our business because a significant portion (approximately 75% as of December 31, 2014) of our loans are secured, either on a primary or secondary basis, by real estate. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. The Bank\u2019s loans have already been adversely affected by the current decline in the real estate market. Continuation or worsening of such conditions could have additional negative effects on our business in the future.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry.\nPrior to 2014, declines in the real estate markets negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. These write-downs caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to reduce or eliminate dividends, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally.\nAs a result of the foregoing, there is a potential for new laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity and capital standards, and financial institution regulatory agencies are now expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the more frequent issuance of informal remedial measures and formal enforcement orders. These negative developments in the financial services industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments could negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate loans and work with borrowers to collect loans, and adversely impact our financial performance.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs a result of the financial crisis which began in 2008, the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) was significantly depleted. As a result, the FDIC increased the required deposit insurance premiums and instituted special assessments. The insurance premiums have remained at the elevated levels although no special assessments have been levied since 2009. Continuation of the elevated insurance levels may adversely affect our financial condition.\nCertain of our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in the future.\nWe test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in a value of our goodwill and intangibles which may be less than the carrying value and, as a result, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we determine that impairment exists at a given time, our earnings and the book value of the related goodwill and intangibles will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. During 2014, the Company recorded an impairment charge totaling $1.2 million on the remaining goodwill in connection with the sale of ARS. At December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s goodwill totaled $4.0 million which is subject to annual review. A goodwill impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2013 indicated pretax impairment of $18.7 million primarily driven by the loss of clients and a reduction in the projected earnings capacity of the Company\u2019s asset management subsidiary. The impairment charge was recorded in net income in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nOur income is sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nOur profitability, like that of most banking institutions, depends to a large extent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings. Accordingly, our results of operations and financial condition depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our assets and liabilities in response to such movements. Management estimates that, as of December 31, 2014, a 200 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a 1.1% increase in net interest income and a 100 basis point decrease would result in a 2.4% decrease in net interest income. See also \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part 7 of this document.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates may result in an increase in higher cost deposit products within our existing portfolios, as well as a flow of funds away from bank accounts into direct investments (such as U.S. government and corporate securities and other investment instruments such as mutual funds) to the extent that we may not pay rates of interest competitive with these alternative investments. Our inability to re-deploy excess liquidity into higher yielding assets will continue to compress margins and earnings.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. We cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur markets are intensely competitive, and our principal competitors are larger than us.\nWe face significant competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. This competition is based on, among other things, interest rates and other credit and service charges, the quality of services rendered, the convenience of the banking facilities, the range and type of products offered and the relative lending limits in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers. Our market area has a very high density of financial institutions, many of which are branches of institutions that are significantly larger than we are and have greater financial resources and higher lending limits than we do. Many of these institutions offer services that we do not or cannot provide. Nearly all such institutions compete with us to varying degrees.\nOur competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies and other financial service companies. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, and money market funds and other securities funds offered by brokerage firms and other similar financial institutions. We face additional competition for deposits from non-depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms, and insurance companies. Competition may increase in the future as a result of recently proposed regulatory changes in the financial services industry.\nIf we cannot fully integrate new business lines and technologies, our operating expenses could increase without corresponding revenue being recognized.\nWe have introduced two new lending products, asset based and equipment financing, during 2014 and 2013. Personnel have been hired and systems purchased to start these business lines. If we are unable to achieve the required loan origination levels to offset these costs, our non-interest expenses could increase without revenue to offset these costs.\nIn addition, we have purchased new mobile banking platforms. If we are unable to integrate the platforms and generate the anticipated fees, our non-interest expense could increase without a corresponding increase to fee income.\nInflation can have an impact on the cost of our operations.\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto incorporated by reference herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts or estimated fair value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services.\nExtensive regulation and supervision may have a negative impact on our ability to compete in a cost-effective manner and subject us to material compliance costs and penalties.\nThe Company, primarily through its principal subsidiary and certain non-bank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Such laws are not designed to protect the Company\u2019s stockholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. The Company is also subject to a number of federal laws, which, among other things, require it to lend to various sectors of the economy and population, and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti-money laundering and customer identification. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s compliance with certain of these laws will be considered by banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may affect our business activities, financial position and profitability by increasing our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs, placing restrictions on certain products and services, and limiting our future capital raising strategies.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law by the President of the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act implements significant changes in financial regulation and will impact all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank. Among the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s significant regulatory changes, was the creation of a new financial consumer protection agency, known as the CFPB, that is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection. CFPB has exclusive authority to issue regulations, orders and\nguidance to administer and implement the objectives of federal consumer protection laws. CFPB will also have the ability to participate, with the OCC, in our consumer compliance examinations. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and authorizes state attorney generals\u2019 to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act also restricts the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency to preempt state consumer protection laws applicable to national banks, such as the Bank, and may affect the preemption of state laws as they affect subsidiaries and agents of national banks, changes the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage, and potentially increases the FDIC assessment payable by the Bank. We expect that the CFPB and certain other provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act will significantly increase our regulatory compliance burden and costs and may restrict the financial products and services we offer to our customers.\nBecause many of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s provisions require regulatory rulemaking, we are uncertain as to the impact that some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will have on the Company and the Bank and cannot provide assurance that the Dodd-Frank Act will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for other reasons.\nTechnological change may affect our ability to compete.\nThe banking industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to the public.\nIn addition, because of the demand for technology-driven products, banks are increasingly contracting with outside vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions. The use of technology-related products, services, delivery channels and processes exposes a bank to various risks, particularly transaction, strategic, reputation and compliance risks. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with our increased dependency on technology.\nThe failure of our operating facilities or our computer systems or network, or the intentional disruption of our systems by malicious third parties, could disrupt our businesses and cause financial losses.\nOur business is dependent on the technology services we provide to clients and our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of financial transactions. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems which facilitate these services may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our clients\u2019 information, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsourced or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.\nIf one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019, operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial costs, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss. Potential costs of a cyber incident may include, but would not be limited to, remediation costs, increased protection costs, lost revenue from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss of current and/or future customers, and litigation.\nOur framework for managing risks and risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Company, thereby resulting in losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Company. The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Company is subject. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Company\u2019s risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Company has not appropriately anticipated or identified. Any lapse in the Company\u2019s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Company\u2019s risk management framework, governance, procedures or practices could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Company, materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Company to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Company to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nThe inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nTo a large degree, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel whose expertise, knowledge of our markets, and years of industry experience would make them difficult to replace. Competition for skilled leaders in our industry can be intense, and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we would like to have working for us. In addition, as a result of the Merger, we may be subject to a greater risk of losing certain of our key personnel. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business, given the specialized knowledge of such personnel and the difficulty of finding qualified replacements on a timely basis. To attract and retain personnel with the skills and knowledge to support our business, we offer a variety of benefits that may reduce our earnings.\nIf federal, state, or local tax authorities were to determine that we did not adequately provide for our taxes, our income tax expense could be increased, adversely affecting our earnings.\nThe amount of income taxes we are required to pay on our earnings is based on federal and state legislation and regulations. We provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements, based on our results of operations, business activity, legal structure, interpretation of tax statutes, assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit, and application of financial accounting standards. We may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain. Our net income and earnings per share may be reduced if a federal, state, or local authority assesses additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate either due to a change in tax law, a change in regulatory or judicial guidance, or an audit assessment that denies previously recognized tax benefits. One of our subsidiaries, Grassy Sprain Real Estate Holdings, Inc., qualifies as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) under the laws of the State of New York. A qualified REIT is entitled to special tax treatment by the State of New York, which lowers the Company\u2019s tax rate. If the State of New York changes the provisions of the tax code related to REITs, our tax rate could increase.\nChanges in Accounting Policies or Accounting Standards can cause us to change the manner in which we report our financial results and condition in adverse ways and could subject us to additional costs and expenses.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets or liabilities and financial results. The Company identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, security valuations, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change their guidance governing the form and content of the Company\u2019s external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret GAAP, such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and the Company\u2019s outside independent registered accounting firm, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in GAAP and changes in current interpretations are beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how the Company reports its financial results and condition. In certain cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently (also retroactively) which may result in the Company restating prior period financial statements for material amounts. Additionally, significant changes to GAAP may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review prior to originating certain commercial real estate loans, as well as before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Related to the Merger\nBecause the market price of Sterling common stock will fluctuate, Company shareholders cannot be certain of the market value of the Merger consideration they will receive.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each share of Company common stock (except for specified shares of Company common stock owned by the Company or Sterling) will be converted into the right to receive 1.92 shares of Sterling common stock. The market value of the Merger consideration will vary from the closing price of Sterling common stock on the date Sterling and the Company announced the Merger, on the date that the joint proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to Company shareholders, on the date of the special meeting of Company shareholders and on the date the Merger is completed and thereafter. Any change in the market price of Sterling common stock prior to the completion of the Merger will affect the market value of the Merger consideration that Company shareholders will receive upon completion of the Merger, and there will be no adjustment to the Merger consideration for changes in the market price of either shares of Sterling common stock or shares of Company common stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of Sterling and the Company, including, but not limited to, general market and economic conditions, changes in our respective businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Therefore, at the time of the Company special meeting you will not know the precise market value of the consideration you will receive at the effective time of the Merger. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of Sterling common stock and for shares of Company common stock.\nThe market price of Sterling common stock after the Merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of the Company or Sterling currently.\nUpon completion of the Merger, holders of Company common stock will become holders of Sterling common stock. Sterling\u2019s business differs in important respects from that of the Company, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Sterling common stock after the completion of the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Sterling and the Company.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nBefore the Merger and the Bank merger may be completed, Sterling and the Company must obtain approvals from the FRB and the OCC. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining whether to grant these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. An adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or such factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or the Bank merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger or the Bank merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Merger or the Bank merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger and the Bank merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger.\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized.\nSterling and the Company have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on Sterling\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Sterling and the Company in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect Sterling\u2019s ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on\nSterling\u2019s financial results and the value of its common stock. If Sterling experiences difficulties with the integration process and attendant systems conversion, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause Sterling and/or the Company to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from Sterling and/or the Company and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. In addition, though the integration and systems conversion of Sterling and legacy Sterling Bancorp following the completion of the Provident New York Bancorp merger on October 31, 2013 is nearly complete, it remains a top priority and continues to utilize human and capital resources. The risk of a diversion of Sterling\u2019s management\u2019s attention away from ongoing business concerns may be increased by two merger integration processes which are relatively close in time. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of the Company and Sterling during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Merger on the combined company. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Merger could be less than anticipated.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in the registration statement filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger are preliminary and the actual financial condition and results of operations after the Merger may differ materially.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in the registration statement filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the combined company\u2019s actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the Merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments to illustrate the effect of the Merger had it been completed on the dates indicated, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the Company\u2019s identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation for the Merger reflected in such registration statement is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the Company as of the date of the completion of the Merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in the registration statement.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from the interests of our shareholders.\nOur shareholders should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of our shareholders generally. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered these interests, among other matters, when making its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and in recommending that our shareholders vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement.\nThe material interests considered by our board of directors were as follows:\n\u25cf\nThe terms of the restricted stock, restricted stock unit and stock option awards held by Company directors and executive officers provide for accelerated vesting of the awards upon a change in control such as the Merger.\n\u25cf\nSubject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we have, in consultation with Sterling, accelerated the payment of certain compensatory amounts so that they were paid in 2014 for tax planning purposes with respect to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Such amounts included the acceleration of the vesting date of the Company restricted stock, restricted stock units and 2014 bonuses under our Annual Incentive Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan.\n\u25cf\nWe previously entered into change of control agreements on April 10, 2014 and July 7, 2014 with a number of our executive officers, which entitle each of them to certain payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control such as the Merger.\n\u25cf\nWe previously entered into a consulting agreement, dated October 6, 2014, with our retiring executive chairman, which entitles him to terminate the consulting agreement and receive certain payments and benefits in connection with a change in control such as the Merger.\n\u25cf\nIn connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, our president and chief executive officer entered into a one-year consulting agreement, dated as of November 4, 2014, with Sterling National Bank, which entitles him to the receipt of consulting fees for providing services in connection with the integration of Sterling and the Company.\n\u25cf\nOur supplemental deferred compensation agreement dated as of October 1, 2010, and our supplemental retirement plans each provide for accelerated vesting of retirement benefits in connection with a change in control such as the Merger.\n\u25cf\nFour current Company directors will join the board of Sterling and Sterling National Bank upon completion of the Merger, and Sterling will also establish an advisory board consisting of Company directors who are not joining the boards of Sterling and Sterling National Bank and who wish to serve on the advisory board. Members of the Sterling board are expected to receive compensation consistent with the compensation paid to current non-employee directors of Sterling. During 2014, such compensation included an annual retainer fee of $24,000 and per-meeting fees. Directors are also eligible to receive stock awards and stock option grants and are eligible to participate in Sterling\u2019s Deferred Director Fee\nPlan. Members of the Sterling advisory board will be eligible to receive fees for their service on the advisory board that are substantially similar to the fees received by members of our Business Development Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement, which in 2014 totaled approximately $1,250 in value per person. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Sterling had not yet identified which of our current directors will join the boards of Sterling and Sterling National Bank upon completion of the Merger.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company or Sterling.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. For example, our or Sterling\u2019s businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of our or Sterling\u2019s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company or Sterling may be required to pay to the other party a termination fee of $20 million.\nThe Company and Sterling will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company or Sterling. These uncertainties may impair our or Sterling\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company or Sterling to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company or Sterling. Retention of certain employees by the Company or Sterling may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company or Sterling. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the Company or Sterling, our business or Sterling\u2019s business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the Company has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing, and each of the Company and Sterling has agreed to certain restrictive covenants.\nIf the Merger is not completed, Sterling and the Company will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nEach of Sterling and the Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, Sterling and the Company would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement limits the Company\u2019s ability to pursue acquisition proposals and requires either company to pay a termination fee of $20 million under limited circumstances, including circumstances relating to acquisition proposals for the Company. Additionally, certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may deter potential acquirers.\nThe Merger Agreement prohibits the Company from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating certain third-party acquisition proposals. In addition, unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, we have an unqualified obligation to submit the Merger proposal to a vote by the shareholders of the Company, even if the Company receives a proposal that the our board believes is superior to the Merger. The Merger Agreement also provides that Sterling or the Company must pay a termination fee in the amount of $20 million in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including involving our failure to abide by certain obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing such an acquisition. Each of the members of the Company\u2019s board, solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of the Company, and certain of their affiliates, has entered into voting agreements and have agreed to vote his or her shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in favor of the Merger Agreement and certain related matters and against alternative transactions. The Company\u2019s shareholders that are party to these voting agreements beneficially own and are entitled to vote in the aggregate approximately 24.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as of the record date. Additionally, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or of the New York Business Corporation Law (\u201cNYBCL\u201d) could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of the Company or may discourage a potential competing acquirer.\nThe shares of Sterling common stock to be received by Company shareholders as a result of the Merger will have different rights from the shares of Company common stock.\nUpon completion of the Merger, Company shareholders will become Sterling stockholders and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Sterling certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The rights associated with Company common stock are different from the rights associated with Sterling common stock.\nHolders of Company and Sterling common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Merger and will exercise less influence over management.\nHolders of Company and Sterling common stock currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting the Company and Sterling, respectively. Upon the completion of the Merger, each Company shareholder who receives shares of Sterling common stock will become a stockholder of Sterling with a percentage ownership of Sterling that is smaller\nthan the stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership of the Company. It is currently expected that the former shareholders of the Company as a group will receive shares in the Merger constituting approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of Sterling common stock immediately after the Merger. As a result, current stockholders of Sterling as a group will own approximately 70% of the outstanding shares of Sterling common stock immediately after the Merger. Because of this, Company shareholders may have less influence on the management and policies of Sterling than they now have on the management and policies of the Company and current Sterling stockholders may have less influence than they now have on the management and policies of Sterling.\nCompany shareholders will not have dissenters' or appraisal rights in the Merger.\nDissenters\u2019 rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to shareholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the NYBCL, a shareholder may not dissent from a merger as to shares that are listed on a national securities exchange at the record date fixed to determine the shareholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of shareholders to vote upon the agreement of merger or consolidation.\nBecause the Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so listed on the record date, and because the Merger otherwise satisfies the foregoing requirements of the NYBCL, holders of Company common stock will not be entitled to dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights in the Merger with respect to their shares of Company common stock.\nPending litigation against the Company and Sterling could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the Merger or a judgment resulting in the payment of damages.\nThe outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Sterling and the Company, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. Plaintiffs may file additional lawsuits against Sterling, the Company and/or the directors and officers of either company in connection with the Merger. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is completed may adversely affect Sterling\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nMarket conditions and other factors may affect the value of our common stock.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:\n\u25cf\nconditions in the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally;\n\u25cf\ninterest rates;\n\u25cf\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u25cf\ngovernment action or regulation;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions or conditions in the financial markets;\n\u25cf\nour past and future dividend practice;\n\u25cf\nour financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects; and\n\u25cf\nthe stock price of Sterling Bancorp, our partner in the Merger.\nAccordingly, the shares of common stock that an investor purchases may trade at a price lower than that at which they were purchased.\nThere may be future dilution of our common stock.\nThe Company is currently authorized to issue up to 25 million shares of common stock, of which 20,082,568 shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2014, and up to 15 million shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are outstanding. The Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common or preferred stock, without stockholder approval. We may issue such additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital in connection with acquisitions, as part of our employee and director compensation or otherwise. The issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock or convertible securities could substantially dilute holders of our common stock. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock, stock options, or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those stock options or warrants are exercised or the restricted stock vests, our stockholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend on our common stock.\nWe increased our total per share dividend in 2014 to $0.28 per share from a total per share dividend of $0.24 in 2013, compared to a total per share dividend of $0.72 in 2012. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and we may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Also, as a bank holding company, the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends depends on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends.\nDividends from the Bank are the only current significant source of cash for the Company. There are various statutory and regulatory limitations regarding the extent to which the Bank can pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to the Company. Federal bank regulatory agencies also have the authority to limit further the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends based on such factors as the maintenance of adequate capital for the Bank, which could reduce the amount of dividends otherwise payable. Under applicable banking statutes, at December 31, 2014, the Bank could have declared additional dividends of approximately $22.0 million to the Company. No assurance can be given that the Bank will have the profitability necessary to permit the payment of dividends in the future; therefore, no assurance can be given that the Company would have any funds available to pay dividends to stockholders.\nFederal bank regulators require us to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital. The failure to maintain these capital levels or to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject us to a variety of informal and formal enforcement actions. Moreover, dividends can be restricted by any of our regulatory authorities if the agency believes that our financial condition warrants such a restriction.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is restricted under the New York Business Corporation Law, which provides that dividends may only be paid by a corporation out of its surplus.\nThe FRB issued a supervisory letter dated February 24, 2009 to bank holding companies that contains guidance on when the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or severely limit dividends including, for example, when net income available for stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends. The letter also contains guidance on the redemption of stock by bank holding companies which urges bank holding companies to advise the FRB of any such redemption or repurchase of common stock for cash or other value which results in the net reduction of a bank holding company\u2019s capital during the quarter. The Company did not redeem or repurchase any common stock in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.\nOur common stock price may fluctuate due to the potential sale of stock by our existing stockholders.\nWe are aware that several of our large stockholders may in the future liquidate some or all of their shares of Company common stock for estate planning and other reasons. In addition, other stockholders may sell their shares of common stock from time to time on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise. As a result, substantial amounts of our common stock are eligible for future sale. While we cannot predict either the magnitude or the timing of such sales, if a large number of common shares are sold during a short time frame, it may have the effect of reducing the market price of our common stock.\nOur earnings may be subject to increased volatility.\nOur earnings may experience volatility as a result of several factors. These factors include, among others:\n\u25cf\ninterest rate risk and margin compression;\n\u25cf\nregulatory action against the Bank;\n\u25cf\na continuation of the poor economic conditions, or further adverse economic developments;\n\u25cf\ninstability in the financial markets;\n\u25cf\nour inability to generate or maintain creditworthy customer relationships in our primary markets;\n\u25cf\nunexpected increases in operating costs, including special assessments for FDIC insurance;\n\u25cf\nfurther credit deterioration in our loan portfolio or unanticipated credit deterioration, or defaults by our loan customers;\n\u25cf\ncredit deterioration or defaults by issuers of securities within our investment portfolio; or\n\u25cf\nincreased costs relating to the Merger, including payment of the termination fee.\nIf any one or more of these events occur, we may experience significant declines in our net interest margin and non-interest income, or we may be required to record substantial charges to our earnings, including increases in the provision for loan losses, credit-related impairment on securities (both permanent and other-than-temporary), and impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets, in future periods.\nOur certificate of incorporation, the New York Business Corporation Law and federal banking laws and regulations may prevent a takeover of our company.\nIf the Merger is not completed, provisions of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, the New York Business Corporation Law and federal banking laws and regulations, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for another third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 93043, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HVB"}
