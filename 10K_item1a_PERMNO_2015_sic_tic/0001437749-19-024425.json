RISK FACTORS\nThe following material risk factors pertain to matters to which there is a substantial likelihood that a potential investor would attach importance in determining whether to purchase the Company\u2019s stock.\nOur advertising revenues may decline due to weakness in the brick and mortar retail sector.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising. The demand for advertising is sensitive to the overall level of economic strength, both in the markets in which we operate and nationally. Additionally, the decline in the financial or economic conditions of our advertisers could alter discretionary spending by advertisers. Certain segments of the economy have been challenged in recent years, particularly in the brick and mortar retail sector, and total advertising revenues have declined as a result. Advertising revenues may worsen if advertisers reduce their budgets, shift their spending priorities, are forced to consolidate or cease operations.\nOur operating revenue may be materially adversely affected if we do not successfully respond to the shift in newspaper readership and advertising expenditures away from traditional print media and towards digital media. Significant capital investments may be needed to respond to this shift.\nCurrently, our primary source of revenue is from advertising and marketing services, which accounts for 52% of our revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for more than 36% of our revenue. The media publishing industry has experienced rapid evolution in consumer demands and expectations due to advances in technology, which have led to a proliferation of delivery methods for news and information. The number of consumers who access online services through devices other than personal computers, such as tablets and mobile devices, has increased dramatically in recent years and likely will continue to increase. The media publishing industry also continues to be affected by demographic shifts, with older generations preferring more traditional print newspaper delivery and younger generations developing the habit of consuming news through digital media. In addition, the revenues generated by media publishing companies have been affected significantly by the shift in advertising expenditures towards digital media.\nThe future revenue performance of our digital business depends to a significant degree upon the growth development and management of our subscriber and advertising audiences. The growth of our digital business over the long term depends on various factors, including, among other things, the ability to:\n\u2022\nContinue to increase digital audiences;\n\u2022\nAttract advertisers to our digital platforms;\n\u2022\nTailor our products to efficiently and effectively deliver content and advertising on mobile devices;\n\u2022\nMaintain or increase the advertising rates on our digital platforms;\n\u2022\nExploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of competitors and develop new content, products and services;\n\u2022\nInvest funds and resources in digital opportunities;\n\u2022\nPartner with, or use services from, providers that can assist us in effectively growing our digital business; and\n\u2022\nCreate digital content and platforms that attracts and engages audiences in our markets.\nIf we are unable to grow our digital audience, distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or develop compelling new products and services that engage users across multiple platforms, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Responding to the changes described above may require us to make significant capital investments and incur significant research and development costs related to building, maintaining, and evolving our technology infrastructure, and our ability to make the level of investments required may be limited.\nSee \"Audiences\u201d in Item 1, included herein, for additional information on about our print and digital audiences.\nWe are subject to significant financial risk as a result of our $444 million in total consolidated debt.\nWe have $443.6 million of debt outstanding as of September 29, 2019, as discussed more fully below (and certain capitalized terms used below defined) in Item 7,\"Liquidity\" and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.\nAs of September 29, 2019, our debt consists of the following:\n\u2022\n$400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.5% Senior Secured Notes (the \"Notes\") due March 2022, pursuant to an Indenture dated as of March 31, 2014 (the \"Indenture\"), of which $363,420,000 is outstanding;\n\u2022\n$23,120,000 revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Facility\") under a First Lien Credit Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (as amended November 1, 2019, the \u201c1st Lien Credit Facility\u201d), which is undrawn; and\n\u2022\n$150,000,000 12.0% second lien term loan under a Second Lien Loan Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (the \u201c2nd Lien Term Loan\u201d) due December 2022, of which $80,207,000 is outstanding.\nWe have reduced debt by $41.2 million in 2019 and $173.5 million over the last three fiscal years. Despite the significant reduction, our debt, net of cash, is 3.6 times adjusted EBITDA of $121.5 million in 2019. This level of debt increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. Higher leverage ratios, our economic performance, our credit ratings, adverse financial markets or other factors could adversely affect our future ability to refinance our maturing debt on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may have insufficient earnings or liquidity to meet our future debt obligations.\nAt September 29, 2019, after consideration of letters of credit, we had approximately $17,644,000 available for future use under our Revolving Facility. Including cash, our liquidity at September 29, 2019 totaled $26,289,000. This liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows. Our Adjusted EBITDA has been strong and has exceeded $121 million in each year from 2011 through 2019, but there can be no assurance that such results will continue.\nAt September 29, 2019, the principal amount of our outstanding debt totaled $443,627,000. At September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 our debt, net of cash, was 3.6 times our Adjusted EBITDA in both years.\nOur 1st Lien Term Loan, entered into on March 31, 2014, was paid in full in November 2018 ahead of the original due date of March 2019. Final maturities of our other debt range from March 2022 through December 2022. The Revolving Facility matures on December 28, 2020. We expect to amend and extend our Revolving Facility prior to its maturity.\nThere are numerous potential consequences under the Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan if an event of default, as defined in the respective debt agreements, occurs and is not remedied. Many of those consequences are beyond our control. The occurrence of one or more events of default would give rise to the right of the applicable lenders to exercise their remedies under the Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan, respectively, including, without limitation, the right to accelerate the repayment of all outstanding debt and take actions authorized in such circumstances under applicable collateral security documents.\nOur ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and to refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due, if necessary. The Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan have only limited affirmative covenants with which we are required to maintain compliance. We are in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 29, 2019. The ability to make payments on our indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness prior to when it comes due may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and industry conditions.\nThe Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan each contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to grow our business or return capital to our stockholders.\nThe Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan each contain various restrictions, covenants and representations and warranties. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants or breach these representations or warranties in any material respect, such noncompliance would constitute a default, and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the agreements related thereto to be immediately due and payable and enforce their respective interests against collateral pledged under such agreements.\nSubject to certain exceptions, these covenants limit and/or restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, loans or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets; and\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments, including repurchases of outstanding common stock and dividends.\nThe restrictions described above may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company may face risk associated with the discontinuation of and transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark interest rate.\nIt is anticipated that LIBOR will be discontinued as of the year ending 2021. The expected discontinuation of LIBOR will require lenders and their borrowers to transition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate, which could have an impact on and risk to the Company if not completed in a timely manner. The Company has already begun to address this risk by amending its loan documents to include an alternative benchmark interest rate.\nWe compete with a large number of companies in the local media industry; if we are unable to compete effectively, our advertising and subscription revenues may decline.\nWe compete for audiences and advertising revenue with newspapers and other media such as the internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, outdoor billboards and yellow pages. For example, as the use of the internet and mobile devices has increased, we have lost some classified advertising and subscribers to online advertising businesses and our free Internet sites that contain abbreviated versions of our publications. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we fail to compete effectively with competing newspapers and other media, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nAs digital revenues increase as a proportion of our total revenues, we will become increasingly subject to risks associated with digital media operations.\nThe central component to our business strategy involves transitioning from traditional print businesses to digital media businesses and, accordingly, we expect our digital revenues to increase as a percentage of our total revenues in future periods. That transition comes with additional risk of operating mainly as a digital media company, including:\n\u2022\nRates we achieve in the marketplace for the advertising inventory on our digital platforms may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\nCustomized news feeds and news aggregation websites, which are often free to users, may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for users to visit our websites or use our digital products;\n\u2022\nOur inability to increase our digital presence and visibility, which also may reduce our traffic levels;\n\u2022\nOur inability to maintain and improve the performance of our customers' advertising on our digital properties; and\n\u2022\nTechnology developed to block the display of advertising on websites could proliferate, impairing our ability to generate digital revenues;\n\u2022\nMobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, may present challenges for traditional display advertising;\n\u2022\nOur use of subscription models (which may require users to pay for content after accessing a limited number of pages or news articles for free on our websites each month) may cause consumers to opt out of subscription offers in greater numbers than anticipated or result in fewer page views or unique visitors to our websites than projected;\n\u2022\nNew delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, loss of distribution control, or loss of direct relationships with consumers;\n\u2022\nTechnical or other problems could prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, and users could develop negative views about the quality or usefulness of our products; and\n\u2022\nOur inability to respond successfully to these or similar challenges could materially adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our digital revenues.\nOur business, reputation and results of operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to significant data security breaches or if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nIn the 13-weeks ended September 29, 2019, 29.3% of our revenue was obtained from digital sources, including advertising and one of our businesses, TownNews, that provides digital infrastructure and digital publishing services for us and other companies.\nWe use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including the misappropriation of personally identifiable information that we store and manage and disabling or taking over our websites, which contain our breaking news stories. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access and to disable systems and websites change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that we, or the security systems we implement, will protect against all of these rapidly changing risks.\nIn addition, attempts to compromise information technology systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and the techniques used to perpetrate such compromises are constantly changing. Maintaining the security of our systems is critically important both due to our reliance on those systems and because they store and process confidential subscriber, employee, and other sensitive personal data. Although we and our third-party service providers have implemented security measures and other controls designed to prevent breaches, these precautions might fail to defend against future cyber-attacks or prevent breaches or other disruptions to our systems or those of our third-party providers. Because cyber-attacks evolve quickly and often are not recognized until after they are launched, we may be unable to anticipate them or implement adequate measures to prevent a breach. A significant breach could result in, among other things:\n\u2022 Taking down our websites, as media companies have been a target of their websites being disabled;\n\u2022\nImproper disclosures of personal data or confidential information;\n\u2022\nExpenditures of significant resources to remedy the breach and defend against further attacks;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management's attention and resources;\n\u2022\nLiability under laws that protect personal data; and\n\u2022\nLoss of customer trust and, as a result, revenues.\nConsequences of these actions could result in harm to our reputation, loss of revenue, increased operating costs, lead to legal exposure to customers and employees as well as subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect our customers and employees personal data. We maintain insurance coverage against certain of such risks, but cannot guarantee that such coverage will be applicable or sufficient with respect to any given incident.\nWe rely on revenue from printing and distribution of third-party publications and digital services that may be subject to many of the same business and industry risks facing us.\nWe generate a portion of our revenue from printing and distributing third-party publications, and our relationships with these third parties are generally through short-term contracts. Typically, these third parties are operating in the same industry and a similar geographical location as us. In addition, digital services revenue is derived primarily from third-party businesses in the same industry as us. As a result, revenue from these third parties is subject to the same macroeconomic and industry trends affecting our operations. If their businesses are adversely affected by these trends, our associated revenue would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to reduce future expenses to offset potential revenue declines.\nAs a result of adverse general business conditions in our industry and our operating results, we have reduced cash costs of our operations significantly since 2011 by reducing workforce, centralizing or regionalizing operations and implementing cost-control measures. If we do not achieve expected savings from these initiatives, or if our operating costs increase, our total operating costs may be greater than anticipated and our profitability may be lower than anticipated.\nWe may incur additional non-cash impairment charges.\nWe have significant amounts of goodwill and identified intangible assets. Since 2007 we have recorded impairment charges totaling almost $1.3 billion to reflect the reduced value of these assets. Should general economic, market or business conditions decline, and cause a negative impact on our stock price or projected future cash flows, we may need to record additional impairment charges in the future. Such charges would not impact our cash flows or debt covenant compliance. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with such assets.\nA decrease in our stock price may limit the ability to trade our stock or for the Company to raise equity capital.\nUnder the NYSE listing standards, if our common stock fails to maintain an adequate per share price and our total market capitalization falls below $50.0 million, our common stock could be removed from the NYSE and traded in the over-the-counter market. In July 2011, the NYSE notified us that our common stock did not meet the NYSE continued listing standards due to the failure to maintain an adequate share price. Under the NYSE rules, our common stock was allowed to continue to be listed during a cure period. In February 2012, after completing our debt refinancing, the NYSE notified us that we were again in compliance with the minimum closing price standard. In January 2013, the NYSE notified us that we had returned to full compliance with all continued listing standards. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to meet these listing standards, and the removal of our common stock from the NYSE could adversely affect our ability to raise equity capital.\nSustained increases in funding requirements of our pension and postretirement obligations may reduce the cash available for our business.\nPension liabilities, net of plan assets, totaled $47 million at September 29, 2019, an increase of $20.3 million from September 30, 2018 primarily due to unfavorable changes to discount rates used to determine our pension obligations and an increase in pension contributions.\nOur pension and postretirement plans invest in a variety of equity and debt securities. Future volatility and disruption in the securities markets could cause declines in the asset values of our pension and postretirement plans. In addition, a decrease in the discount rates or changes to mortality estimates and other assumptions used to determine the liability could increase the benefit obligation of the plans. Unfavorable changes to the plan assets and/or the benefit obligations could increase the level of required contributions above what is currently estimated, which could reduce the cash available for our business and debt service.\nOver the last several years, federal legislation has provided for pension funding relief, temporarily reducing our pension contributions. Even with funding relief, we expect to have to make additional contributions to our plans in the future.\nWe expect to be subject to withdrawal liability in connection with one multiemployer pension plan and may be subject to additional withdrawal liabilities in connection with other multiemployer pension plans, which may reduce the cash available for our business.\nWe contributed to three multiemployer defined benefit pension plans during the year under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements (\"CBAs\"). Based on the most recent communications from the plans\u2019 administrators, two of these plans are currently in \u201ccritical\u201d status, as that term is used in relation to such plans under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. For plans that are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply and/or we could be required to make additional contributions.\nIn 2019, we effectuated a total withdrawal from our CWA/ITU multiemployer pension plan and as a result we are subject to a claim from the multiemployer pension plan for a withdrawal liability. The amount of such liability will be dependent on actions taken, or not taken, by the pension plan, as well as the future investment performance and funding status of the pension plan. The withdrawal liability is expected to be funded over a 20 year period.\nIn 2019, we received the final assessment for the partial withdrawal liability associated with our GCIU plan. The withdrawal liability is expected to be funded over a 20 year period.\nA portion of our employees are members of unions, and if we experience labor unrest, our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired.\nOur ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired in some markets, if we experience labor unrest. In addition, the results of future labor negotiations could harm our operating results as a result of higher overall compensation costs. While we have not had a history of labor strikes, we cannot ensure that a strike will not occur in one or more of our markets in the future. As of September 30, 2019, approximately 11.0% of full-time and part-time employees were represented by unions. Most of our union-represented employees are currently working under labor agreements, with expiration dates through September 2021.\nWe are dependent upon newsprint for our products and we may experience additional price increases which could affect our earnings.\nThe raw material of newspapers, and our other print publications, is newsprint. We purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. We believe we will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for our needs and consider our relationships with newsprint producers to be good. Newsprint purchase prices can be volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs and both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Price fluctuations can affect our results of operations. We have not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d, included herein.", "PERMNO": 50286, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "LEE"}
