{"cik": "1695357", "company": "Provention Bio, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our other public filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those we currently believe to be material, but they are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider not to be material, actually occur or become material risks, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company formed in October 2016 and have a limited operating history. We do not lease or own any laboratory space and we have historically had a remote work environment for our employees. We outsource most of our manufacturing and clinical trial operations as well as certain other functions.\nWe have acquired or in-licensed four clinical stage assets and a late stage preclinical enteroviral vaccine platform. Marketing approval of our product candidates will require extensive clinical testing data to support safety and efficacy requirements, as well as pharmaceutical development, manufacturing and preclinical data, all of which are needed for regulatory approval, and the requirements may be different in different jurisdictions in which we intend to launch our products. The likelihood of success of our business plan must be considered in light of the challenges, substantial expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with developing and expanding early-stage businesses and the regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking, involves a substantial degree of risk, and is a capital-intensive business.\nAccordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, especially clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies such as ours. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a company with a limited operating history will face. In particular, we may not be able to:\n\u25cf successfully implement or execute our current business plan;\n\u25cf successfully start and complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of our product candidates;\n\u25cf successfully contract for the manufacture of our clinical drug products and establish a commercial drug supply;\n\u25cf secure market exclusivity and/or adequate intellectual property protection for our product candidates;\n\u25cf attract and retain an experienced management and advisory team;\n\u25cf raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate our business plan, including clinical development, regulatory approval and related milestones, and commercialization for our product candidates;\n\u25cf successfully recruit and retain a fully functional launch ready commercial organization;\n\u25cf successfully launch teplizumab in the United States;\n\u25cf successfully execute our teplizumab launch plan for the At-Risk indication, including raising awareness and expanding screening to identify patients At-Risk of developing clinical T1D; and\n\u25cf successfully establish strategic partnerships to launch teplizumab outside the United States\nIf we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed, and your investment will be adversely affected.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses and may never become profitable or be able to sustain profitability.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses without corresponding revenues unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize our product candidates. We expect to incur significant expense to complete our clinical programs for our product candidates in the United States and elsewhere. We may never be able to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of our product candidates in any indication in the United States or internationally. Even if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, we may not be able to generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability.\nWe expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance clinical trials for our product candidates as well as significant costs to build out our commercial infrastructure and conduct pre-commercial activities for teplizumab as we prepare for potential commercialization. As a result, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will be increasing. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable may impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect our business and our ability to raise capital.\nWe need to raise additional funding. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate certain, or all of our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our operating costs to be substantial as we incur costs to support our commercialization efforts for teplizumab, including costs related to the buildout of an internal commercial infrastructure, and our ongoing and planned clinical trials for teplizumab and our other product candidates. We will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future or until such time as we obtain regulatory approval for and execute a successful commercial launch of teplizumab, if ever. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a net loss of $114.4 million and $98.6 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $292.1 million and $127.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund current operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of the financial statements included in this report. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and our available capital resources could be consumed faster than we currently expect. However, if our teplizumab BLA resubmission is approved, we will need additional capital to fund increases in costs related to commercialization and payment of any potential milestones triggered under our current agreements, including with MacroGenics.\nWe do not have any prospective credit facilities as a source of future funds apart from the available capacity under our 2021 ATM Program (as defined below), and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private equity offerings, public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, could increase our expenses and could require that our assets secure such debt. Moreover, any debt we incur must be repaid regardless of our operating results. If we choose to pursue additional indications and/or geographies for our product candidates, in-license or acquire additional development assets, or otherwise expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate, we may also need to raise additional capital sooner than expected.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may need to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or cease operations altogether, or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or any future product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will adequately support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.\nOur operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf the success of our development strategy;\n\u25cf the time, resources, and expense required to develop and conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u25cf the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u25cf the cost of manufacturing and maintaining sufficient inventories of our products to meet anticipated demand;\n\u25cf any product liability or other lawsuits related to our product candidates and the costs associated with defending them or the results of such lawsuits;\n\u25cf the cost of defending against securities litigation including stock-drop litigation and related derivative law suits;\n\u25cf the cost of growing our ongoing development operations and establishing commercialization operations;\n\u25cf the cost to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations;\n\u25cf the costs associated with being a public company; and\n\u25cf the costs associated with commercialization.\nAny material increases in our operating expenses will have a material impact on our financial condition and business operations. In addition, if we are unable to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, we may need to raise additional capital, delay or cease development of one or more of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval, Manufacturing and Commercialization\nOur BLA resubmission in February 2022 and our regulatory efforts may not successfully address to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, the deficiencies identified by the FDA in the July 2021 CRL, including deficiencies related to the demonstration of PK comparability of our planned commercial product and drug product used in historical clinical trials as well as other product quality requirements. If we are not able to satisfy the FDA\u2019s requests and requirements, including by, as requested by the FDA in our January 2022 Type B meeting, including in the BLA resubmission an adjusted dosing regimen for the planned commercial product to match the exposure of clinical material used in prior clinical trials with safety justifications to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, we may not be successful in obtaining approval of teplizumab for the at-risk patient indication in the near-term, or at all. Additionally, if we are not able to address the FDA\u2019s PK comparability and other requirements and obtain approval for teplizumab for the delay of clinical T1D in at-risk individuals, we may be required to conduct additional research, analysis or clinical trials before we can submit a BLA for teplizumab in a newly diagnosed patient indication.\nAs required by the FDA, we provided in the initial BLA for the at-risk indication physiochemical and analytical data for teplizumab supporting the comparability between the study drug previously manufactured by MacroGenics and Eli Lilly and our to-be-commercialized drug product. In addition to conducting analytical tests to evaluate comparability we also conducted a double-blind, single low-dose, PK/PD bridging study in healthy subjects (\u201cBridging PK/PD Study\u201d) to support the CMC comparability assessment between the teplizumab study drug derived from drug substance manufactured by Eli Lilly and the to-be-commercialized teplizumab drug product derived from the drug substance manufactured by our contract manufacturing partner, AGC Biologics in connection with the PROTECT Trial. This single low-dose Bridging PK/PD Study was the first time the teplizumab drug product derived from the drug substance manufactured by AGC Biologics was used in humans. We submitted to the FDA that we believe the results of the Bridging PK/PD Study suggests that the drug substances manufactured by AGC Biologics and Eli Lilly are comparable. Comparison of drug plasma concentration versus time after dosing in the Bridging PK/PD Study shows a lower AUC for the teplizumab drug product derived from the drug substance manufactured by AGC Biologics. Based on our PK/PD modeling, we submitted our supporting data and analysis to the FDA to support our belief that the lower AUC observed in the PK/PD Bridging Study is not significant enough to impact the efficacy or safety of the to-be-commercialized teplizumab drug product when used as proposed in our BLA filing. However, on July 2, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL for our BLA for teplizumab for the delay of clinical T1D in at-risk individuals. In the CRL, the FDA stated that the single, low-dose Bridging PK/PD Study we conducted had failed to show PK comparability between planned commercial product and historical clinical trial product and that we will need to establish PK comparability appropriately or provide other data that adequately justify why PK comparability is not necessary in order to obtain approval for the teplizumab BLA for an at-risk indication.\nIn September 2021, we announced that we had completed data collection from the PROTECT PK/PD Substudy we conducted with the goal of addressing the FDA\u2019s PK comparability considerations and in November 2021 we announced preliminary top-line data from this substudy. We participated in a Type A meeting with the FDA on November 18, 2021, to discuss data and analysis from the PROTECT PK/PD Substudy data and PD markers that we believe are supportive of comparability and subsequently also had a Type B meeting with the FDA on January 26, 2022. In preliminary comments provided in advance of the January 26th meeting, the FDA noted that our data package does not adequately support PK comparability by itself, because predicted primary PK parameters are indicative of a lower exposure from the AGC Biologics drug substance as compared to the Eli Lilly drug substance. To address this concern, the FDA proposed, and we agreed, to use PK modeling to adjust the 14-day dosing regimen for the planned commercial product to match the exposure of clinical material used in prior clinical trials by ensuring that the 90% confidence intervals for relevant PK parameters fall within the target 80-125% range. On this basis, the FDA agreed that we could proceed to resubmit the BLA.\nOur teplizumab BLA resubmission in February 2022 for the At-Risk Indication may not be deemed complete and acceptable for review or ultimately approved by the FDA. Our BLA resubmission and other regulatory efforts may not be successful in addressing, to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, the deficiencies identified in the FDA\u2019s July 2021 CRL for our original teplizumab BLA for an At-Risk Indication, including product quality and PK comparability considerations. Additionally, our BLA resubmission and our regulatory efforts may not successfully address the FDA\u2019s requests and requirements discussed at our January 2022 Type B meeting. For example, although we included in the BLA resubmission, as requested by the FDA, an adjusted dosing regimen based on PK modeling and clinical data for teplizumab to match exposure of our planned commercial product to drug product used in historical clinical trials, the FDA\u2019s PK comparability concerns may not be addressed to their satisfaction which could result in another CRL for our BLA resubmission. Additionally, as a result of any final resolutions to address the FDA\u2019s considerations related to PK comparability in connection with the teplizumab BLA resubmission for an At-Risk Indication, the FDA may require that we further characterize the teplizumab planned commercial product in the PROTECT Trial, including potentially requiring additional research, analysis, clinical data or clinical trials, to support a regulatory pathway for a newly diagnosed indication of teplizumab.\nUltimately, we may not be successful in our goal to continue to work with the FDA to successfully secure approval of the teplizumab BLA for at-risk patients. We may not be able to address to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the agency\u2019s concerns relating to PK comparability and other requirements in the short-term or at all. If we fail to address the FDA\u2019s concerns and requirements, our business and operations may be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain approval for or generate revenues from our product candidates, our ability to create stockholder value will be limited.\nOur product candidates are in various stages of clinical development. Our ability to generate product revenue, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates, which may never occur. For example, our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products impractical to manufacture, unmarketable, or unlikely to receive marketing approval. We currently generate no revenue from sales of any product, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.\nWe will be required to submit our clinical trial protocols and receive approvals from the regulatory authorities before we can commence additional studies with our product candidates. Nonclinical study results for our product candidates, including toxicology studies, may not support the filing of an IND or foreign equivalent for the product candidate.\nMoreover, we may not be successful in obtaining acceptance from the regulatory authorities to start our clinical trials. Prior to commencing any clinical trials, we will also have to obtain approval from the Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d), or Ethics Committee (\u201cEC\u201d) for each of the institutions at which we plan to conduct our clinical trials. If we do not obtain such acceptance, the time in which we expect to commence clinical programs for any product candidate will be extended and such extension will increase our expenses and increase our need for additional capital.\nFurther, there is no guarantee that our clinical trials will be successful or that we will continue clinical development in support of an approval from the regulatory authorities for any indication. Our clinical trial results may show our product candidates to be less effective than expected or have unacceptable side effects or toxicities. For example, our Phase 2a PRINCE trial did not achieve its primary endpoint of a change in Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index Score at week 12 as compared to placebo. We note that most drug candidates never reach the clinical development stage and even those that do commence clinical development have only a small chance of successfully completing clinical development and gaining regulatory approval.\nOur business currently depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. Our product candidates will require additional preclinical and clinical development, regulatory and marketing approval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and expertise for both clinical development and commercial production and substantial investment and significant commercialization efforts before we generate any revenue from product sales.\nThe success of our current and future product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u25cf successful completion of preclinical and clinical studies with positive results;\n\u25cf sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf investigational new drug or clinical trial authorization applications, being cleared such that our product candidates can commence clinical trials;\n\u25cf successful initiation of enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;\n\u25cf successful data from our clinical programs that support a finding of safety and effectiveness and an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations;\n\u25cf receipt of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n\u25cf successful development of our internal manufacturing processes and transfer, where applicable, from our reliance on CMOs, to our own manufacturing facility, or from our own manufacturing facility to CMOs or the facilities of collaboration partners;\n\u25cf establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n\u25cf commercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others, including our ability to recruit and retain commercial talent;\n\u25cf acceptance of our product candidates and their therapeutic uses, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf effective competition with other therapies and treatment options;\n\u25cf establishment and maintenance of healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and national healthcare systems for any approved products;\n\u25cf enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims;\n\u25cf maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; and\n\u25cf achieving desirable medicinal properties for the intended indications.\nIf we do not succeed in one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, to successfully commercialize our product candidates, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused delays to our clinical trials. Moreover, the longer the pandemic persists, the more impact it will have on our clinical trial and other business plans and timelines. In addition, this pandemic has caused substantial disruption in the financial markets and may adversely impact economies worldwide, both of which could result in adverse effects on our business, operations and ability to raise capital.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to drive global uncertainty and has caused, and may continue to cause, delays to the development of certain of our product candidates. Delays in completing our clinical trials are expected to increase our costs, slow our development and approval process and could negatively impact our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. We have experienced some level of disruption to three of our current or planned clinical trials. For example, in March 2020, we announced a temporary pause in the randomization of patients with newly diagnosed T1D into our global Phase 3 PROTECT study of teplizumab. During the second quarter of 2020, we resumed enrolling patients in the PROTECT study on a country by country and site by site basis and by the end of the third quarter of 2020, all sites were activated, with a majority of the sites actively enrolling patients. We completed target enrollment in the PROTECT study in August 2021 and expect to report top-line results from the PROTECT study in the second half of 2023, subject to change for any potential interruptions related to COVID-19, regulatory decisions, issues or other interruptions. In addition, we, with our development partner Amgen, collectively decided that, to protect the integrity and quality of the PRV-015 Phase 2b trial in gluten free diet NRCD, we would stagger study startup throughout the third quarter of 2020 rather than initiating screening in the second quarter of 2020, as had originally been scheduled. We initiated the Phase 2b trial in August 2020 and the pandemic has caused difficulties and delays in recruitment. As a result of these delays, we now expect to report top-line results from the PROACTIVE study by the end of 2023. Additionally, our plans to initiate the Phase 2a portion of the PREVAIL study in lupus patients were delayed, predominantly due to COVID-19 related impacts on our plans, and we recently initiated the study in January 2022.\nTimely enrollment in our clinical trials is dependent upon global clinical trial sites which may be adversely affected by global health matters, such as pandemics. We are currently conducting clinical trials for our product candidates in many countries, including the United States, European Union, the UK and Canada and may expand to other geographies. Many of these regions in which we operate are currently being or may in the future be affected by COVID-19. Some factors from the COVID-19 outbreak that may delay or otherwise adversely affect enrollment in the clinical trials of our product candidates, as well as adversely impact our business generally, include:\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff, and delays enrolling patients in our clinical trials or increased rates of patients withdrawing from our clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting COVID-19, being forced to quarantine, or not accepting home health visits, particularly for older patients with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19;\n\u25cf limitations on travel that could interrupt key trial activities, such as clinical trial site initiations and monitoring, domestic and international travel by employees, contractors or patients to clinical trial sites, including any government-imposed travel restrictions or quarantines that may impact the ability or willingness of patients, employees or contractors to travel to our clinical trial sites or secure visas or entry permissions, any of which could delay or adversely impact the conduct or progress of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption or delays in the operations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and foreign regulatory authorities, which may impact review and approval timelines;\n\u25cf interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of raw materials for or our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems; and\n\u25cf business disruptions caused by potential workplace, laboratory and office closures and an increased reliance on employees working from home, disruptions to or delays in ongoing laboratory experiments and operations or travel, and staffing shortages.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly impacted the FDA\u2019s ability to conducted domestic and foreign inspections. On March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products; and, on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, on July 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to resume certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA intends to use this risk-based assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. In April 2021 the FDA issued guidance on conducting voluntary remote interactive evaluations of manufacturing and outsourcing facilities as well as facilities involved in non-clinical and clinical research. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe pandemic has already caused significant disruptions in the financial markets, and may continue to cause such disruptions, which could adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements and may also impact the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Moreover, it is possible the pandemic will continue to significantly impact economies worldwide, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact of COVID-19. Additionally, the pandemic could negatively impact our ability to execute a successful launch of teplizumab if we receive marketing approval, which could impact our revenue making potential and have other negative material adverse impacts on our business. The full extent of the impact and effects of COVID-19 on our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations remain uncertain at this time.\nClinical drug development involves a risky, lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. Although prior pre-clinical and clinical studies, data and analysis may support our belief in the potential of our pipeline of products, the results of our ongoing clinical trials for them may not be positive or supportive of our beliefs. We may encounter substantial delays in completing our ongoing clinical trials or starting any new clinical trials, which in turn may require additional costs, or we may fail to demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities for our product candidates, which could negatively and materially impact our business.\nIt is impossible to predict if or when any of our product candidates will prove safe or effective in humans or will receive regulatory approval, and the risk of failure through the development process is high. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u25cf delays in reaching, or failing to reach, a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;\n\u25cf delays in reaching, or failing to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with a sufficient number of prospective CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining required IRB, or EC, approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u25cf delays in recruiting a sufficient number of suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trial recruitment or other clinical trial activities;\n\u25cf imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies, IRBs, or ECs;\n\u25cf failure by our CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to contractual, clinical trial, regulatory or legal requirements;\n\u25cf failure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s GCP or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u25cf delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of sufficient quantities of our product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u25cf delays in having patients\u2019 complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf subjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indications for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing clinical trials;\n\u25cf clinical study sites or patients dropping out of a study;\n\u25cf delay or failure to address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs or increases in costs of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u25cf occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; or\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs or ECs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board for such trial or by the FDA, MHRA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA, MHRA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nProduct development costs for any of our product candidates will increase if we have delays in testing or approval or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend study protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our study protocols to the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and IRBs/ECs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of that study. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, the ECs or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical trial sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical trials of any of our product candidates, its commercial prospects may be materially harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, if one or more clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of any of our product candidates could be significantly reduced. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Further, product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Additionally, data submitted to regulators are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent agency approval. We cannot assure you that the FDA, EMA, MHRA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will view the results as we do, that the views of different regulatory authorities on our study results and data will be consistent with each other or that any future trials of any of our product candidates will achieve positive results. For example, in the European Union, we have initiated the process of seeking scientific advice from the EMA\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (\u201cCHMP\u201d), with respect to the regulatory pathway for teplizumab. While the guidance provided in scientific advice procedures do not seek to pre-evaluate the results of studies, the initial scientific advice letter that we received from CHMP in December 2020 suggested that an additional confirmatory study would be necessary to support a marketing authorization application (\u201cMAA\u201d), for the use of PRV-031 in at-risk individuals. We plan to engage with CHMP to further elucidate the disease-modifying effect of PRV-031 supported by study data in the context of clinical management of T1D, specifically in at-risk individuals. If, however, the EMA determines that our current PRV-031 data package is insufficient to support an MAA for at-risk individuals and requires additional studies or data, such determination would delay or prevent approval of PRV-031 in the European Union and European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) for this indication. We have independently engaged with the MHRA to discuss a potential regulatory path for PRV-031 in the United Kingdom. We filed for and received in July 2021 an Innovation Passport for teplizumab in the UK. The Innovation Passport is the mandated entry point to the ILAP in the United Kingdom to facilitate approval of and market access to an innovative medicine. Additionally, we have engaged the MHRA in a scientific advice procedure to discuss, among other topics, ILAP. The discussions with and feedback from the MHRA in the United Kingdom, ILAP partner agencies such as the NICE and the Scottish Medicines Consortium will help us evaluate the possible regulatory and market access paths forward in the UK for teplizumab. On April 20, 2021 we received a scientific advice letter from the MHRA on matters relating to the therapeutic position, non-clinical and clinical characterization of PRV-031. We have started a preliminary discussion with MHRA and its ILAP partners in the development of a TDP and identification of the relevant toolkits to support approval and market access of teplizumab in the United Kingdom. Further engagement with the MHRA and its ILAP partners is planned in 2022. There is no guarantee that a similar position would be taken by the EMA in the European Union. The advice given by the MHRA makes clear that it is not legally binding with regard to any future MAA for PRV-031, nor can it be taken as indicative of any future agreed position. The MHRA indicated in its letter that it is of the view that there is an unmet medical need for a treatment that delays or prevents progression to T1D in at-risk patients. The MHRA did not request another confirmatory study to be carried out, acknowledging that the indication being sought is rare and that we may have difficulties recruiting sufficient numbers of subjects for such a study. However, the MHRA has considered that an MAA may benefit from additional supplementary information on patient preference. Such additional information would seek to strengthen the argument that PRV-031 would benefit the at-risk patients according to the proposed label claim. The MHRA also considered that reliance on one pivotal study to obtain a marketing authorization ought to meet the criteria described in the EMA/CPMP guidance entitled \u201cPoints to consider on application with (i) meta-analyses and (ii) one pivotal study\u201d (CPMP/EWP/2330/99) , which for the time being, is still relevant to applications made in the United Kingdom. We also plan additional engagements with EMA and other European stakeholders in 2022; however, these stakeholders may not agree with our views on our teplizumab data package or our view of the relevant medical need in at-risk populations and our efforts may not lead to favorable positions or decisions relating to or an approval of teplizumab by the MHRA or a positive opinion by the EMA and a subsequent marketing authorization by the European Commission. Even if PRV-031 is approved in United Kingdom and/or in the European Union, the MHRA or EMA/European Commission, may limit the indication for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming additional clinical trials or reporting as conditions of an approval, amongst other requirements which we may or may not be able to comply with. Even if teplizumab were to be granted a marketing authorization, we could not guarantee that the payers and health technology agencies in the United Kingdom and the Member States of the European Union would accept the therapeutic value and/or cost-effectiveness of teplizumab for it to be adopted for clinical use in the respective national health systems.\nWe have conducted and are conducting clinical trials outside the United States and anticipate conducting additional clinical trials outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nWe are currently conducting clinical trials for our product candidates in countries outside of the United States and we anticipate that we will conduct additional clinical trials in countries outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of such study data by the FDA is subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are considered applicable to the United States patient population and United States medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data is considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. In addition, such clinical trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the clinical trials are conducted. A description of any studies related to overdosage is also required, including information on dialysis, antidotes, or other treatments, if known. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from clinical trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept any such data, it would likely result in the need for additional clinical trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our development plan.\nRisks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf foreign regulatory requirements that could burden or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u25cf administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple foreign regulatory schema;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations which could negatively impact our financial condition since certain payments are paid in local currencies;\n\u25cf manufacturing, customs, shipment and storage requirements;\n\u25cf cultural differences in medical practice and clinical research; and\n\u25cf diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nBiologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations.\nThe successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. In addition, after receiving product approval, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the agency authorizes its release. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to obtain any required regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be limited.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, EMA, MHRA and other regulatory authorities in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and other countries, where regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates as prescription pharmaceutical products in the United States until we receive approval of a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d), or BLA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA or a BLA is approved. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA or a BLA to the FDA or other regulatory authorities and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. We have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on consultants and third party CROs with expertise in this area to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities and grant of manufacturing authorizations and Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMP\u201d) certificates by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. If our development efforts for our product candidates, including regulatory approval, are not successful for their planned indications, our business will be materially adversely affected. Our success depends on the receipt of regulatory approval and the issuance of such regulatory approvals is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials may not be satisfactory or may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA, EMA/European Commission, MHRA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval;\n\u25cf the dosing of our product candidates in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u25cf we may be required to provide additional analysis or data for already completed clinical studies, or conduct additional studies;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, MHRA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to obtain clearance, CE marking or approval of companion diagnostic tests;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, MHRA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree on the design or implementation of our clinical trials, including the methodology used in our studies, our chosen endpoints, our statistical analysis, or our proposed product indication;\n\u25cf our failure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA, MHRA or comparable regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf we may fail to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf immunogenicity might affect a product candidate efficacy and/or safety;\n\u25cf the FDA, MHRA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA, MHRA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u25cf there may be changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our nonclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nAdditionally, even if we obtain regulatory approval for one indication, there is no guarantee we will be able to gain regulatory approval for additional indications. For example, we intend to initially seek regulatory approval for our CVB vaccine product candidate for the prevention of acute CVB infection. The results of longitudinal studies demonstrating the connection between CVB and T1D or celiac disease will be necessary to expand the indicated use of this vaccine to T1D. These studies must be completed and submitted to the FDA, MHRA or EMA prior to receiving approval in the United States, United Kingdom or European Union to market the CVB vaccine for additional indications such as prevention of T1D. Such studies will be costly and time consuming and may not demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s, MHRA\u2019s or EMA\u2019s satisfaction the connection between the CVB virus and the onset of T1D or celiac disease. Failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates for the foregoing, or any other reasons, will prevent or delay us from commercializing our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. We cannot guarantee that regulators will agree with our assessment of the results of the clinical trials we have conducted or intend to conduct in the future or that such future trials will be successful. The FDA, EMA, MHRA and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional clinical trials, or pre-clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe FDA, EMA, MHRA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could require the clearance, CE marking or approval of a companion diagnostic device for teplizumab as a post-marketing commitment or otherwise, which may require substantial financial resources and could delay or prevent regulatory approval of teplizumab.\nThe FDA has previously communicated that it (i) acknowledges that the diagnosis stage 2 T1D may be well understood to future prescribers of teplizumab, and therefore, specification of autoantibody testing in the labeling may not be required for the safe and effective use of teplizumab and (ii) is continuing to discuss internally the requirement for a companion diagnostic(s) for teplizumab, and given these uncertainties, we should consider seeking additional advice from the agency on the process of companion diagnostic development, as it remains possible it will be required as a post-marketing commitment. Our position is that a companion diagnostic should not be required for the use of teplizumab in at-risk individuals based upon, among other reasons, (i) relevant FDA precedent and guidance, (ii) the fact that the presence of autoantibodies is supportive, but not sufficient, for a diagnoses of stage 2 T1D and (iii) the commercial availability of FDA-cleared tests or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, licensed laboratory-developed tests to identify T1D, which the teplizumab final label can direct physicians to use.\nShould the FDA, EMA, MHRA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagree with us and require the use of a companion diagnostic, we may face delays or obstacles in obtaining approval for teplizumab, as the FDA or other regulatory authorities may take the position that a companion diagnostic device is required prior to granting approval of teplizumab. In addition, if a companion diagnostic is required, we may be dependent on the cooperation and efforts of third-party collaborators to develop one or more companion diagnostics, which generally require FDA clearance or approval, or equivalent approval in other jurisdictions. We and our potential future collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing, validating or obtaining clearance/approval/CE marking for such companion diagnostics. Any delay or failure by us or our potential future collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory clearance, CE marking or approval of such companion diagnostics, if necessary, may delay or prevent approval of teplizumab, PRV-101 or our other product candidates.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates for an indication, the FDA, EMA/European Commission, MHRA or foreign equivalent may still impose significant restrictions on their indicated uses or marketing or the conditions of approval or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming patient registries or post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, post-market surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy and a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d) or other risk minimization measures. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed in the United States, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges. Any such post-marketing requirements may negatively impact our commercialization plans or require us to raise additional capital to support the execution of such requirements. Additionally, if we face challenges or are unable to comply with post-marketing requirements, we may not be able to maintain marketing approval, or we may decide to abandon the program.\nOur product candidates will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, as well as continued compliance with current GCP regulations for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval, and any additional requirements in other jurisdictions. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current GMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents.\nWith respect to sales and marketing activities by us or any future licensor, advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other applicable federal, state and local laws in the United States and similar legal requirements in other countries. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and licensors, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the United States Anti-Kickback Statute, United States False Claims Act, and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs. If we participate in the United States Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to United States federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Similar requirements exist in many of these areas in other countries.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates are approved for a particular indication, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA, MHRA, and the competent authorities of the European Union Member States strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, MHRA, or the European Commission as reflected in, or in a manner that is otherwise inconsistent with, the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, physicians may nevertheless legally prescribe our products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, or otherwise inappropriately promoted our products, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and false or misleading claims, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted products, including off-label uses, may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to the following administrative or judicial sanctions:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u25cf voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf restrictions of the labeling of a product;\n\u25cf restrictions on product distribution or use\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf issuance of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines, restitution, or disgorgement of profit or revenues;\n\u25cf suspension, withdrawal, variation or revocation of regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspension or termination of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u25cf suspension or imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u25cf product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of product.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase our product liability exposure.\nEven though we apply for orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be able to obtain such designation or obtain orphan drug marketing exclusivity. Even if we obtain orphan drug marketing exclusivity, it may not effectively protect the product from competition.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug\u2019s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant\u2019s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates in the indications for which we think they might qualify, if we elect to seek such applications.\nWe have obtained orphan drug designation from the FDA for teplizumab for the treatment of newly diagnosed T1D, however, there is no guarantee that the FDA, the European Commission or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will grant any future application for orphan drug designation for any of our other product candidates, including teplizumab for the use in at-risk individuals, which would make us ineligible for the additional exclusivity and other benefits of orphan drug designation, and may also impact our ability to obtain benefits under other incentive programs, such as the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program. For example, we applied for orphan drug designation of teplizumab for the use in at-risk individuals which was denied by the FDA\u2019s OOPD in February 2021. We believe current data suggests that there may be an initial undiagnosed prevalence approaching 165,000-200,000 Stage 2 T1D subjects in all age groups, however, we believe the diagnosed prevalence for Stage 2 T1D subjects is less than 200,000, which, we believe could have met the FDA\u2019s criteria for orphan drug designation. We currently do not have plans to take any additional steps to address OOPD\u2019s positions.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for teplizumab for the treatment of newly-diagnosed T1D in the United States, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication. Furthermore, the FDA can waive orphan drug exclusivity if we are unable to manufacture sufficient supply of teplizumab or if the FDA finds that a subsequent applicant for newly-diagnosed T1D demonstrates clinical superiority to teplizumab. Accordingly, orphan drug exclusivity for a product may not effectively protect the product from competition.\nAlthough we may apply for rare pediatric disease designation for our product candidates, we may not be able to obtain such designation, and rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that the NDA or BLA for the product will qualify for a priority review voucher upon approval.\nUnder the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, upon the approval of a qualifying BLA or NDA for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such an application would be awarded a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent BLA or NDA. On December 27, 2020, the Creating Hope Reauthorization Act extended the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program, and after September 30, 2024, the FDA may only award a voucher for an approved rare pediatric disease product application if the sponsor has rare pediatric disease designation for the drug, and that designation was granted by September 30, 2024. After September 30, 2026, the FDA may not award any rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers.\nWe submitted a request for rare pediatric disease designation for teplizumab for the use in at-risk individuals, however, the FDA sent a second deficiency letter for our application in October 2021. In its letter, the FDA\u2019s Office of OOPD, noted that they believe the At-Risk Stage 2 population is greater than 200,000 subjects in the United States and we have one year from the date of the deficiency letter (or any approved extension thereof) to provide arguments otherwise, or our request for Rare Pediatric Disease designation will be considered voluntarily withdrawn. We currently do not have plans to take any additional steps to address OOPD\u2019s positions.\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant any future requests for Rare Pediatric Disease designation for any of our product candidates, including teplizumab for the use in at-risk individuals. Moreover, even if we obtain rare pediatric disease designation, there is no guarantee that we will qualify for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon FDA approval of the NDA or BLA for a rare pediatric disease. Rare pediatric disease designation does not lead to faster development or regulatory review of the product, or increase the likelihood that it will receive marketing approval.\nAlthough we may pursue expedited regulatory approval pathways for a product candidate, it may not qualify for expedited development or, if it does qualify for expedited development, it may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nAlthough we believe there may be an opportunity to accelerate the development of certain of our product candidates through one or more of the FDA\u2019s or EMA\u2019s expedited programs, such as fast track, breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval or priority review, we cannot be assured that any of our other product candidates will qualify for such programs.\nFor example, in the United States, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Although breakthrough designation or access to any other expedited program may expedite the development or approval process, it does not change the standards for approval. If we apply for breakthrough therapy designation or any other expedited program for our product candidates, the FDA may determine that our proposed target indication or other aspects of our clinical development plans do not qualify for such expedited program. Even if we are successful in obtaining a breakthrough therapy designation or access to any other expedited program, we may not experience faster development timelines or achieve faster review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. For example, the time required to identify and resolve issues relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls, the acquisition of a sufficient supply of our product for clinical trial purposes or the need to conduct additional preclinical or clinical studies may delay approval by the FDA, even if the product candidate qualifies for a breakthrough therapy designation or access to any other expedited program. Access to an expedited program may also be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Additionally, qualification for any expedited review procedure does not ensure that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approval for such product candidate.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/ or to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress (\u201cCongress\u201d) of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from pending or future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, on March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other provisions, the CARES Act made a number of changes to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d) aimed at preventing drug shortages. Similarly, the FDA has issued a number of guidance documents describing the agency\u2019s expectations for how drug manufacturers should comply with various FDA requirements during the pandemic, including with respect to conducting clinical trials, distributing drug samples, and reporting post-marketing adverse events. Moreover, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increasing political and regulatory scrutiny of drug supply chains, resulting in proposed and enacted legislative and executive actions, including Executive Orders, to incentivize or compel drug manufacturing operations to relocate to the United States. It is not clear how these changes and proposals could impact our business. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nHealthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our product candidates\u2019 commercial success, if approved.\nThe United States government and individual states have been aggressively pursuing healthcare reform designed to impact delivery of, and/or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives intended to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the \u201cACA\u201d), which, among other things, expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual health insurance mandate; included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs; imposed an annual fee on manufacturers of branded drugs; and expanded government enforcement authority. We face uncertainties because there have been, and may be additional, federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. The case Texas v. Azar, which challenges the constitutionality of the ACA, including provisions that are unrelated to healthcare reform but were enacted as part of the ACA, was argued before the Supreme Court in November 2020. The Supreme Court dismissed this challenge to the ACA on June 17, 2021 and, therefore, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to buy health insurance currently remains in effect. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open until August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. The ACA remains subject to legislative efforts to repeal, modify or delay the implementation of the law. However, if the ACA is repealed or modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are delayed, any such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely affect our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the ACA on us at this time.\nIn addition, the expansion of the 340B Drug Discount Program through the ACA has increased the number of \u201ccovered entity\u201d purchasers who are eligible for significant discounts on branded drugs. Additionally, the Health Resources and Services Administration has interpreted the 340B Drug Discount Program law to require manufacturers to extend these discounts to contract pharmacies that have arrangements with covered entities. Several drug manufacturers have commenced litigation, which remains ongoing, challenging the legality of contract pharmacy arrangements under the 340B Drug Discount Program. The resolution of the litigation may affect the way in which manufacturers are required to extend the 340B Drug Discount Program prices to covered entities, including through contract pharmacies. There also are ongoing challenges regarding the implementation of the 340B Drug Discount Program administrative dispute resolution process, which is, in part, intended to resolve claims by covered entities that they have been overcharged for covered outpatient drugs by manufacturers, and claims by manufacturers regarding covered entity compliance with program requirements. The nature of the current administrative dispute resolution process, and the outcomes of these court cases, may have a material adverse impact on our revenue should we participate in the 340B Drug Discount Program after receiving approval for our product candidates.\nBeyond the ACA, in 2020 and early 2021, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued various rules that affect pricing or payment for drug products. For example, effective January 2023, revisions to the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Additional healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Some of these changes have been and may continue to be subject to legal challenge. For example, courts have temporarily enjoined a new \u201cmost favored nation\u201d payment model for select drugs covered under Medicare Part B that was to take effect on January 1, 2021 and would limit payment based on international drug price. On January 13, 2021, in a separate lawsuit brought by industry groups, the government defendants entered a joint motion to stay litigation on the condition that the government would not appeal the preliminary injunction granted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and that performance for any final regulation stemming from the most favored nation payment model interim final rule shall not commence earlier than sixty (60) days after publication of that regulation in the Federal Register. In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several United States Congressional inquiries, hearings and proposed and enacted federal legislation and rules, as well as Executive Orders and regulatory actions, designed to, among other things, reduce or limit the prices of drugs and make them more affordable for patients, such as by tying the prices that Medicare reimburses for physician-administered drugs to the prices of drugs in other countries, reform the structure and financing of Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefits, including through increasing manufacturer contributions to offset Medicare beneficiary costs, bring more transparency to drug pricing rationale and methodologies (including, for example, by requiring manufacturers to disclose planned drug price increases and the rationales for such increases), implement data collection and reporting under Section 204 of Title II of Division BB of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which requires, among other things, health plans and issuers to disclose rebates, fees, and other remuneration provided by drug manufacturers related to certain pharmaceutical products, enable the government to negotiate prices for drugs covered under Medicare, including H.R. 3 which passed the House, revise rules associated with the calculation of Medicaid Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price, including the removal of the current statutory 100% of Average Manufacturer Price per-unit cap on Medicaid rebate liability effective as of January 1, 2024 under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which may significantly affect the amount of rebates paid on prescription drugs under Medicaid and the prices that are required to be charged to covered entities under the 340B Drug Discount Program, create new anti-kickback statute safe harbors applicable to certain point-of-sale discounts to patients and fixed-fee administrative fee payment arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, each of which are currently stayed, and facilitate the importation of certain lower-cost drugs from other countries. The nature and scope of health care reform under the Biden administration remains uncertain, although President Biden supported reforms to lower drug prices during his campaign for the presidency. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, and healthcare reform could increase compliance costs and may adversely affect our future business and financial results.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been adopted that could have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products\u2019 or product candidates\u2019 commercial success. More broadly, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, or the Budget Control Act, includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit, including reductions in Medicare payments to providers through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022). Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or any significant taxes or fees imposed as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.\nIn addition to governmental efforts in the United States, foreign jurisdictions as well as private health insurers and managed care plans are likely to continue challenging manufacturers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement, as well as the level of reimbursement, for pharmaceuticals and other healthcare-related products and services. These cost-control initiatives could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results. The pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the European Union and the UK is subject to strict governmental control. Pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities are complex and may take significant amounts of time. To obtain reimbursement and/or pricing approval in the European Union Member States and/or the UK, we may be required to conduct studies or otherwise provide data demonstrating the cost effectiveness of our products compared with other available established therapies. The conduct of such studies could also result in delays in the commercialization of our products. Additionally, cost-control initiatives, increasingly based on affordability and accessibility, as well as post-marketing assessment of the product\u2019s added value as compared to existing treatments, could decrease the price of our products or the indications for which we are able to obtain reimbursement, which would result in lower revenues to us. New legislative and policy initiatives in the European Union, aimed at increasing accessibility and affordability of medicinal products, and the increased cooperation between the European Union Member States may further impact the price and reimbursement status of our products in the future.\nIf we fail to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we may need to acquire additional product candidates and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe have never developed and obtained approval for any product candidates or commercialized any product candidates. We have limited product candidates and do not have any other compounds in pre-clinical testing, lead optimization or lead identification stages beyond our product candidates. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be sufficiently effective and safe to meet applicable regulatory standards for any indication. If we fail to successfully obtain regulatory approval or commercialize any of our product candidates for their targeted indications, whether as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other therapeutic agents, and if we are unable to acquire additional product candidates in the future, our business will be adversely affected.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited.\nIf approved for marketing, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon each product\u2019s acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance for any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf relative convenience, dosing burden and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any adverse events and the overall safety profile;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which our products are approved;\n\u25cf the acceptance of physicians to include T1D screening in routine patient medical care;\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians to prescribe our product candidates, and the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians and patients to accept 14 consecutive days of IV therapy;\n\u25cf efficacy of our product candidates compared to future competing products or therapies;\n\u25cf the introduction of any new products that may in the future become available targeting indications for which our product candidates may be approved;\n\u25cf new procedures or therapies that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications in which our product candidates may show utility;\n\u25cf pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf the inclusion or omission of our product candidates in applicable therapeutic and vaccine guidelines;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our own or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in approved labeling from regulatory authorities, including any interactions of our products with other medicines patients are taking;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors or to receive the necessary pricing approvals from government bodies regulating the pricing and usage of therapeutics; and\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement or government pricing approvals.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render our product candidates not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve any of our product candidates with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization for that indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals or require risk management plans or a REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our product candidates. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our product candidates.\nWe currently have a limited commercial organization. If we are unable to establish satisfactory sales and commercial support and marketing capabilities, we may not successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe have been gradually building our commercial infrastructure and at present, we have only limited sales personnel. In order to commercialize products that are approved for commercial sales, we must develop our own sales infrastructure. If we are not successful recruiting sales personnel or in building our sales and marketing infrastructure in the United States, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to establish a satisfactory sales infrastructure, we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales, market access, patient services, medical affairs and other key commercial personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent commercial organization.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third parties for the research, development, and commercialization of certain of the product candidates we may develop. If any such collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of those product candidates.\nWe may seek additional third-party collaborators for the research, development, and commercialization of certain of the product candidates we may develop. If we enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of any product candidates we may seek to develop with them. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. We cannot predict the success of any collaboration that we enter into.\nCollaborations pose numerous risks to us, including the following:\n\u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates we may develop or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our medicines or product candidates we may develop if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u25cf collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, enforce, or defend our intellectual property or proprietary rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development, or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u25cf we may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in our collaborations, including if we undergo a change of control;\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates we may develop;\n\u25cf collaboration partners may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity that violate the regulations of the FDA and other regulators, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators, manufacturing standards, healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and internationally or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data; and\n\u25cf collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed, diminished, or terminated.\nIf our collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates, or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of product candidates could be delayed, and we may need additional resources to develop product candidates. In addition, if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to find a suitable replacement collaborator or attract new collaborators, and our development programs may be delayed or the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K apply to the activities of our collaborators.\nThese relationships, or those like them, may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we could face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Our ability to reach a definitive collaboration agreement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of several factors. If we license rights to any product candidates, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture.\nAmgen has the right to assume control over the activities of our anti-IL-15 mAb product candidate.\nPursuant to the Amgen Agreement, Amgen reserves the right, at any time until 120 days after the delivery of the final data package relating to the Phase 2b PROACTIVE study which we initiated in August 2020, to assume control over all activities with respect to our anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody (\u201cmAb\u201d), product candidate, including pricing and marketing decisions, after the payment of a $150.0 million milestone. There can be no assurance that Amgen\u2019s strategic direction will be in line with ours should it assume control of activities, or that their decisions will have a positive impact on our results of operations. Moreover, we may not realize the full economic benefit of this agreement.\nWe face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have existing competitors and will have potential new competitors in a number of jurisdictions, many of which have or will have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make any of our product candidates obsolete or uneconomical. Any new product that competes with an approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, cost, convenience, tolerability and safety to be commercially successful. Other competitive factors, including generic competition, could force us to lower prices or could result in reduced sales. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to our product candidates. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nOur potential competitors both in the United States and throughout the world include companies developing and/or marketing drugs and therapeutic solutions for immune-mediated diseases, including oncological, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as companies working in our specific fields, including T1D, enteroviral and emerging viral diseases, lupus, and inflammatory bowel diseases, such as CD.\nThere can be no assurance that our product candidates will be more effective or achieve greater market acceptance than competitive products, or that our competitors will not succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our products and technologies less competitive or obsolete. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the development by others of new or improved products will not make our product candidates superfluous or obsolete.\nOur product candidates may face competition sooner than expected.\nWe intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our monoclonal antibodies teplizumab and PRV-015, our DART molecule PRV-3279 and our PRV-101 CVB vaccine product candidates provided under the FDCA, and similar laws in other countries. In the United States, we believe that these product candidates will qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (\u201cBPCIA\u201d), which was enacted as part of the ACA. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product or BLA cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The law is complex and the processes the FDA establishes to implement the law could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological product candidates. There is also a risk that Congress could repeal or amend the BPCIA to shorten this exclusivity period, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated after the expiration of our patent protection. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nOur product candidates that are not, or are not considered, biologics that would qualify for exclusivity under the BPCIA may be eligible for market exclusivity as drugs under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. The Ensuring Innovation Act, enacted on April 23, 2021, amended the FDA\u2019s statutory authority for granting such exclusivity to reflect the agency\u2019s existing regulations and longstanding interpretation that award exclusivity based on a drug\u2019s active moiety, as opposed to its active ingredient, which is intended to limit the applicability of this exclusivity, thereby potentially facilitating generic competition. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (\u201cANDA\u201d), or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving 505(b)(2) NDAs or ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.\nEven if, as we expect, our product candidates are considered to be reference products eligible for 12 years of exclusivity under the BPCIA or five years of exclusivity under the FDCA, another company could market competing products if the FDA approves a full BLA or full NDA for such product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the products. Moreover, an amendment or repeal of the BPCIA could result in a shorter exclusivity period for our product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, which incorporated the framework from the Creating and Restoring Equal Access To Equivalent Samples (\u201cCREATES\u201d) legislation, was signed into law as part of the 2019 year-end federal spending package. The legislation purports to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, including by allowing ANDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or biosimilar developers to obtain access to branded drug and biological product samples. While the full impact of these provisions is unclear at this time and initial litigation brought under this law is pending, its provisions do have the potential to facilitate the development and future approval of biosimilar or generic versions of our products if approved, introducing biosimilar or generic competition that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to penetrate international markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize our product candidates in international markets for which we intend to rely on collaborations with third parties. If we commercialize any of our product candidates in international markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our product candidates in international markets;\n\u25cf our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;\n\u25cf the burden of complying with complex and changing international regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u25cf different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u25cf import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf longer accounts receivable collection times;\n\u25cf longer lead times for shipping;\n\u25cf language barriers for technical training;\n\u25cf reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u25cf the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nInternational sales of our product candidates could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we market any of our product candidates or, if approved, commercial products, in a manner that violates healthcare laws, or if we violate government price reporting laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nThe marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation within the United States, with similar requirements in other jurisdictions. Numerous federal, state and local authorities have jurisdiction over, or enforce laws related to, such activities, including the FDA, United States Drug Enforcement Agency, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the United States Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, state departments of health and state pharmacy boards. See the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe FDA enforces laws and regulations which require that the promotion of pharmaceutical products be consistent with the approved prescribing information. While physicians may prescribe an approved product for a so-called \u201coff label\u201d use, it is unlawful for a pharmaceutical company to promote its products in a manner that is inconsistent with its approved label and any company which engages in such conduct can subject that company to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines and/or other penalties against companies for alleged improper promotion and has investigated and/or prosecuted several companies in relation to off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that certain companies enter consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed, curtailed or prohibited. Similarly, industry codes in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions prohibit companies from engaging in off-label promotion and regulatory agencies in various countries enforce violations of the code with civil penalties. While we intend to ensure that our promotional materials are consistent with our label, regulatory agencies may disagree with our assessment and may issue untitled letters, warning letters or may institute other civil or criminal enforcement proceedings.\nWe are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care \u201cfraud and abuse,\u201d including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to sales of any of our products or product candidates that may in the future receive marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. False claims laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent.\nThese laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our current and future business, marketing and other promotional and research activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. In particular, these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements, as well as interactions with healthcare professionals through consultant arrangements, product training, sponsorships, or other activities. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare and other laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Even if such efforts are made, moreover, due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject governmental authorities may possibly conclude that our business practices may not comply with healthcare laws and regulations.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulatory guidance. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies, healthcare providers and other third parties, including charitable foundations, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Numerous pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged improper promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicare or Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates; and providing kickbacks to patients in the form of indirect copay support. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Efforts to ensure that our activities comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Given the breadth of the laws and regulations, limited guidance for certain laws and regulations and evolving government interpretations of the laws and regulations, governmental authorities may possibly conclude that our business practices may not comply with healthcare laws and regulations. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or government regulations.\nResponding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. We may be subject to private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments, with potential liability under the federal False Claims Act including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties. Additionally, as a result of these investigations and qui tam actions, we may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to sanctions, including substantial civil monetary penalties, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, substantial criminal fines and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, we anticipate that we will need to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and a number of other federal and state government pricing programs in the United States in order to obtain coverage for the product by certain government healthcare programs. These programs would generally require us to pay rebates or provide discounts to certain private purchasers or government payers in connection with our products when dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. In some cases, such as with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the government agencies that administer the programs. We may have reimbursement obligations or be subject to penalties if we fail to provide timely and accurate information to the government, pay the correct rebates or offer the correct discounted pricing.\nWe are completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, including teplizumab, with no, to limited redundancies in our supply chain and the commercialization of our product candidates could be halted, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain manufacturing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our product candidates or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the capability or infrastructure to manufacture drug substance, in our product candidates for use in our clinical trials or for commercial products, if any. As a result, we are obligated to rely on contract manufacturers for clinical supplies of our product candidates and will be obligated, if and when any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, to rely on contract manufacturers for commercial supply. We may not be able to engage a contract manufacturer for commercial supply of any of our product candidates on acceptable terms to us, or at all.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, MHRA or other regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA or BLA to the FDA or equivalent applications to other relevant regulatory authorities. We will be completely dependent on our contract manufacturers for compliance with GMPs for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. These GMP regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to our product candidates. If our contract manufacturers do not successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, MHRA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, MHRA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nOur contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with GMPs and similar regulatory requirements. Although we are responsible for oversight of manufacturing of our product candidates, we do not have control over our contract manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by any of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure to grant approval to market any of our product candidates, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. In addition, although we have audit and certain other oversight rights under our contracts with our contract manufacturers, we do not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Failure by our contract manufacturers to comply with or maintain any of these standards could adversely affect our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market any of our product candidates.\nIf, for any reason, these third parties are unable or unwilling to perform, we may not be able to terminate our agreements with them, to the extent applicable, and we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them and we cannot be certain that any such third parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these manufacturers or any alternate manufacturer of finished drug product experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes for our drug substance or finished drug products or should cease doing business with us, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our product candidates or may not be able to create a supply of our product candidates at all. Were we to encounter manufacturing issues, our ability to produce a sufficient supply of any of our product candidates might be negatively affected. Our inability to coordinate the efforts of our third-party manufacturers, or the lack of capacity available at our third-party manufacturers, could impair our ability to supply any of our product candidates at required levels. Because of the significant regulatory requirements that we would need to satisfy in order to qualify a new active drug substances or finished drug products manufacturer, if we face these or other difficulties with our current manufacturers, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our product candidates if we decided to transfer the manufacture of any of our product candidates to one or more alternative manufacturers in an effort to deal with the manufacturing issues. Additionally, failing to obtain sufficient supply of any of our product candidates, due to manufacturing or other issues, may lead to regulatory delays and other issues which may negatively affect our business.\nAny manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally, we rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our potential products. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to a contract manufacturer caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of any of our product candidates, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales.\nWe cannot guarantee that our future manufacturers and suppliers will be able to reduce the costs of commercial scale manufacturing of any of our product candidates over time. If the commercial-scale manufacturing costs of any of our product candidates are higher than expected, these costs may significantly impact our operating results. In order to reduce costs, we may need to develop and implement process improvements. However, in order to do so, we will need, from time to time, to notify or make submissions with regulatory authorities, and the improvements may be subject to approval by such regulatory authorities. We cannot be sure that we will receive these necessary approvals or that these approvals will be granted in a timely fashion. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to enhance and optimize output in our commercial manufacturing process. If we cannot enhance and optimize output, we may not be able to reduce our costs over time.\nIf the contract manufacturers we use fail to comply with their teplizumab contractual obligations to us, or they fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations and requirements to support FDA review, requests and requirements in connection with our BLA resubmission, including any potential FDA decisions that result in limiting the use of our current planned commercial teplizumab supply such as assigning a shorter teplizumab shelf-life than we planned, we may be required to enter into new statements of work or other agreements with CMOs and incur additional costs to increase our planned commercial supply of teplizumab and if we are not able to do so successfully and in a timely manner our business may be negatively and materially impacted.\nEach of our contract manufacturers for our product candidates is a single source supplier. If any of the contract manufacturers in the supply chain for one of our product candidates experiences a delay or is unable to deliver the products or components necessary to manufacture the subject product, our ability to produce the affected product would be materially impaired.\nAlthough we believe we currently have adequate supply to support potential teplizumab clinical and commercial supply demands, and through existing contracts with our CMOs we have the ability to enter into new statements of work to increase our existing supply as needed, we do not have pre-set ongoing commitments from AGC Biologics for commercial supply of teplizumab or with any other contract manufacturers of our other product candidates. Our current agreement with AGC Biologics for the supply of teplizumab as well as agreements with other contract manufacturers of our other product candidates operate on a statement of work basis. If teplizumab is approved for commercial use but we are unable to reach agreement with AGC Biologics on the production of teplizumab for commercial use, or if we are unable to maintain commercial relationships with contract manufacturers of our other product candidates, we may not have sufficient supply of teplizumab to fulfill customer orders or sufficient supply for our other clinical trials. Identifying, qualifying and transferring manufacturing to secondary sources is a time-consuming process and there is no guaranty that we would be able to reach an agreement with a secondary source on acceptable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results or operations and financial condition.\nOur experience manufacturing teplizumab and our other product candidates is limited, and if the FDA requires any changes to our manufacturing process for our products, we are dependent on our CMOs and service providers to timely and compliantly deliver on their contractual obligations. If they fail to do so, this can materially and adversely impact our product development plans and timelines. Additionally, if we are not able to successfully partner with our CMOs and service providers in addressing the FDA\u2019s product quality and other considerations as part of its review of our BLA resubmission, or if we encounter any other manufacturing issues, we may experience delays or disruptions to our efforts to bring teplizumab to market and/or to our other ongoing product development efforts, including our ongoing and planned clinical trials.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing teplizumab and we currently rely on single-source, third-party manufacturers to supply us with drug substance and drug product. We historically relied upon an existing supply of teplizumab drug substance produced by Eli Lilly to manufacture drug product at our third-party manufacturer for use in our clinical trials of teplizumab. We have entered into agreements with our third-party manufacturers to manufacture teplizumab for our anticipated clinical trial needs and plan to enter into additional statements or work and agreements to support teplizumab supply needs, including for a potential commercialization. We believe supplies of teplizumab sufficient to supply the PROTECT study and to fulfill our initial commercial launch needs in the United States have already been manufactured by our third-party manufacturers and have the ability to enter into new statements of work with our manufacturers to increase our teplizumab supply.\nIn order to obtain regulatory approval for teplizumab, third-party manufacturers have been required to consistently produce teplizumab in commercial quantities and of specified quality on a repeated basis and document their ability to do so. The required number of batches of teplizumab have been manufactured at our CMOs by the processes we intend to use for commercialization. The quality and consistency of these lots, along with their comparability to teplizumab manufactured previously for clinical studies, will need to be approved by the FDA. In the July 2, 2021 CRL received by the Company, the FDA stated that as PK remains the primary endpoint for demonstration of comparability between the two products, the Company will need to establish PK comparability appropriately between the intended commercial product and the clinical trial product or provide other data that adequately justify why PK comparability is not necessary. Additionally, the CRL raised product quality and other considerations that we believe we have addressed in our February 2022 BLA resubmission, however, the FDA will ultimately determine whether our efforts sufficiently address their considerations and support an approval. Addressing the FDA\u2019s requests and requirements in the CRL and in subsequent Type A and Type B meetings, including our related efforts to otherwise complete work to support approval of teplizumab for the at-risk indication, as well as the development of our other product candidates will require additional time, resources and successful execution and support by our CMOs and service providers, on whom we are highly dependent to execute on our business plans in a compliant and timely manner. If they fail to do so, it could result in delays or failures of execution that could negatively impact the FDA\u2019s review and decision on our BLA resubmission or any potential commercialization of teplizumab, or otherwise negatively impact our product development efforts including our ongoing clinical trials, such as the PROTECT Study, and planned clinical trials. The FDA may conduct additional site-inspections at any of our CMOs which, depending on timing and outcomes, could negatively impact timing of or regulatory decisions relating to our BLA resubmission. Additionally, we have critical testing and stability work ongoing at one of our CMOs for teplizumab, that if not executed in a timely and compliant manner by our CMO, could negatively impact our BLA resubmission and product development efforts.\nChanges in product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered in an effort to optimize processes. During the course of a development program, sponsors may also change the contract manufacturers used to produce the product candidates. Also, if we, through third-parties, engage in the scale-up of manufacturing, we may encounter unexpected issues relating to the manufacturing process or the quality, purity and stability of the product, and we may be required to refine or alter our manufacturing processes to address these issues. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of clinical trials. Such changes may also require additional testing, notification or approval by the FDA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, MHRA or other regulatory authorities. This could delay completion of clinical trials; require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or studies, or the repetition of one or more clinical trials; increase clinical trial costs; delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates and our business would be substantially harmed.\nWe rely on third-party CROs and vendors to conduct and manage our clinical programs including contracting with clinical sites to perform our clinical trials. We plan to rely heavily on these parties for execution of clinical trials for our product candidates and will control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs and clinical sites will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any products in clinical development. The FDA and its foreign equivalents enforce these GCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA or other regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCPs. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under GMP regulations and will require a large number of test subjects. Our failure or the failure of our CROs or clinical sites to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action up to and including civil and criminal penalties.\nAlthough we design the clinical trials for our product candidates in consultation with CROs, we expect that the CROs will manage all of the clinical trials conducted at contracted clinical sites. As a result, many important aspects of our drug development programs are delegated to third-parties. In addition, the CROs and clinical sites may not perform all of their obligations under arrangements with us or in compliance with regulatory requirements. If the CROs or clinical sites do not perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, breach their obligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates for the subject indication may be delayed or our development program materially and irreversibly harmed. We fully cannot control the amount and timing of resources these CROs and clinical sites will devote to our program or any of our product candidates. If we are unable to rely on clinical data collected by our CROs, we could be required to repeat, extend the duration of, or increase the size of our clinical trials, which could significantly delay commercialization and require significantly greater expenditures.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or clinical sites terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or clinical sites. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, any such clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any of our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nThe outcome of pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and the results of our clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or any future collaborators may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or pre-clinical studies. We will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek marketing approvals for their commercial sale. Success in pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials does not mean that future larger registration clinical trials will be successful. This is because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials.\nFrom time to time, we may publish or report interim or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Interim or preliminary data from clinical trials that we may conduct may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Interim or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the interim or preliminary data. As a result, interim or preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain marketing approval to market our product candidates.\nThird-party coverage and reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues.\nOur ability to successfully market our product candidates will depend in part on the level of reimbursement that government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations provide for the cost of our products and related treatments. Countries in which any of our product candidates are sold through reimbursement schemes under national health insurance programs frequently require that manufacturers and sellers of pharmaceutical products obtain governmental approval of initial prices and any subsequent price changes. In certain countries, including the United States, government-funded and private medical care plans can exert significant indirect pressure on prices. We may not be able to sell our product candidates profitably if adequate prices are not approved or coverage and reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope. Increasingly, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs in ways that are likely to impact our development of products including:\n\u25cf failing to approve or challenging the prices charged for health care products;\n\u25cf introducing reimportation schemes from lower priced jurisdictions;\n\u25cf limiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic products;\n\u25cf denying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the regulatory agencies but are considered to be experimental or investigational by third-party payors; and\n\u25cf refusing to provide coverage when an approved product is used in a way that has not received regulatory marketing approval.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs will be covered. Some third-party payors may impose barriers to coverage of products, such as pre-approval of coverage for new drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. Many private third-party payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to drug products\u2019 coverage partly to control costs to their plans, and may use drug formularies and medical policies to limit their exposure. Factors considered by these payors include product efficacy, cost effectiveness, and safety, as well as the availability of other treatments including generic prescription drugs. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.\nMoreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products. There have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. See \u201cHealthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our product candidates\u2019 commercial success, if approved.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe depend on rights to certain pharmaceutical compounds that are licensed to us. We do not control these pharmaceutical compounds and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from selling our products.\nWe are dependent on licenses from third parties for all but one of our pharmaceutical compounds. We do not own the patents that underlie these licenses. Our rights to use the pharmaceutical compounds we license are subject to the continuation of and compliance with the terms of those licenses. Thus, the patents and patent applications applicable to our product candidates were not written by us or our attorneys, and we did not have control over the drafting and prosecution. The former patent owners and our licensors might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of these patents and applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the patents and applications and had control over the drafting. Moreover, under certain of our licenses, patent prosecution activities remain under the control of the licensor. We cannot be certain that drafting of the licensed patents and patent applications, or patent prosecution, by the licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOur rights to develop and commercialize the product candidates we license are subject to the validity of the owner\u2019s intellectual property rights. Enforcement of our licensed patents or defense or any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents is often subject to the control or cooperation of our licensors. Legal action could be initiated against the owners of the intellectual property that we license and an adverse outcome in such legal action could harm our business because it might prevent such companies or institutions from continuing to license intellectual property that we may need to operate our business. In addition, such licensors may resolve such litigation in a way that benefits them but adversely affects our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nIn addition, our rights to practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not terminating them. Our licenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in material breach of certain terms or conditions of the license agreement or in certain other circumstances. Certain of our licenses contained in our license agreements contain provisions that allow the licensor to terminate the license if (i) we breach any payment obligation or other material provision under the agreement and fail to cure the breach within a fixed time following written notice of termination, (ii) we or any of our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees directly or indirectly challenge the validity, enforceability, or extension of any of the licensed patents, (iii) we declare bankruptcy or dissolve, (iv) we fail to maintain a licensed product in active development or fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize a licensed product. Our rights under the licenses are subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the license, including the payment of royalties due under the license. Termination of these licenses could prevent us from marketing some or all of our products. Because of the complexity of our products and the patents we have licensed, determining the scope of the license and related royalty obligations can be difficult and can lead to disputes between us and the licensor. An unfavorable resolution of such a dispute could lead to an increase in the royalties payable pursuant to the license. If a licensor believed we were not paying the royalties due under the license or were otherwise not in compliance with the terms of the license, the licensor might attempt to revoke the license. If such an attempt were successful, we might be barred from producing and selling some or all of our products.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our technologies, products and processes, successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing these patents against third party competitors. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowable or enforceable in our patents. The existing patents and patent applications relating to our product candidates and related technologies may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights, permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, or provide us with any competitive advantage at all. For example, others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar, identical or competitive to any of our product candidates, or important to our business. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications filed by us, or that we will not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before United States or foreign patent offices. Additionally, the composition of matter patents for teplizumab have expired, and although we have filed method of use patents for teplizumab, these may not provide adequate protection from competitors.\nIn the future we may rely on know-how and trade secrets to protect technology, especially in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, know-how and trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we intend to require employees, academic collaborators, consultants and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary or licensed information. Typically, research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information in which we may have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, our ability to receive patent protection and our ability to protect valuable information owned by us may be imperiled. Enforcing a claim that a third-party entity illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than patents. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for our product candidates or our technologies, third parties could use our proprietary information, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and attain profitability.\nWe may also rely on the trademarks we may develop to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors. We cannot guarantee that any trademark applications filed by us or our licensors will be approved. Third parties may also oppose such trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that the trademarks we use are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe the trademarks we use, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce these trademarks.\nOur product candidates may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the proprietary technologies of others. The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our proprietary technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Additionally, because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of any of our product candidates or any future product candidate. There may be certain issued patents and patent applications claiming subject matter that we may be required to license in order to research, develop or commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know if such patents and patent applications would be available to license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-consuming and may:\n\u25cf result in costly litigation;\n\u25cf divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u25cf prevent us from commercializing a product until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u25cf require us to cease or modify our use of the technology and/or develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u25cf require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nThird parties may hold proprietary rights that could prevent any of our product candidates from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to any of our product candidates or our processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market any of our product candidates or any future product candidates. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign our product candidates or any future product candidates or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing any of our product candidates or a future product candidate, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA number of companies, including several major pharmaceutical companies, have conducted, or are conducting, research in immune-mediated diseases within the therapeutic fields in which we intend to operate, which has resulted, or may result, in the filing of many patent applications related to this research. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every issued United States patent. This means that, in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in an administrative trial before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we would have to prove that the claims are unpatentable by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no assurance that a jury and/or court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity or enforceability.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we will employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) and that such obligations has been breached or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and can be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, the reporting of results of our clinical trials or partner-sponsored clinical trials involving our programs. Other factors may include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u25cf our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing prospects;\n\u25cf our intentions and our ability to establish collaborations and/or partnerships;\n\u25cf the timing or likelihood of regulatory filings and approvals;\n\u25cf our development, commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities;\n\u25cf our expectations regarding the potential market size and the size of the patient populations for our product candidates;\n\u25cf the implementation of our business model and strategic plans for our business and technology;\n\u25cf the scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering our product candidates, along with any product modifications and improvements;\n\u25cf estimates of our expenses, future revenue, capital requirements, our needs for additional financing and our ability to obtain additional capital;\n\u25cf our financial performance; and\n\u25cf developments and projections relating to our competitors and our industry, including competing therapies and procedures.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer.\nOn May 21, 2021, a putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the \u201cCourt\u201d), naming the Company, Chief Executive Officer Ashleigh Palmer, and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Drechsler as defendants (the \u201cSecurities Action\u201d). The complaint alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 in connection with disclosures made regarding the teplizumab BLA and teplizumab\u2019s commercialization timeline. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company\u2019s securities between November 2, 2020 and April 8, 2021. The complaint seeks unspecified damages. Per the procedures set forth by federal securities laws, applications for appointment of lead plaintiff(s) and lead counsel were due to the Court on July 20, 2021. Two applications for lead plaintiff and lead counsel were submitted to the Court on that date; one of the two movants subsequently withdrew its application. On November 17, 2021, the Court appointed a Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel.\nOn December 23, 2021, the Lead Plaintiff and named plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the \u201cAmended Complaint\u201d). The Amended Complaint similarly alleges violations of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 by the Company, Mr. Palmer, and Mr. Drechsler in connection with disclosures concerning the teplizumab BLA and its commercialization timeline, as well as disclosures concerning the TN-10 At-Risk Study. Lead Plaintiff now seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company\u2019s securities between November 2, 2020 and July 6, 2021. The Amended Complaint also seeks unspecified damages. The Company, Mr. Palmer, and Mr. Drechsler filed their response, a motion to dismiss, to the Amended Complaint on February 8, 2022.\nOn August 5, 2021 and October 7, 2021, two shareholder derivative lawsuits concerning substantially the same facts and disclosures underlying the Securities Action (the \u201cDerivative Actions\u201d) were filed in the same Court, naming Chief Executive Officer Ashleigh Palmer, retired and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Drechsler, and Company directors Jeffrey Bluestone, Avery Catlin, Sean Doherty, John Jenkins, Wayne Pisano, and Nancy Wysenski as defendants (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d). The Company is named in both Derivative Actions as a nominal defendant. The Derivative Actions allege: (1) violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act against the Company directors (including Ashleigh Palmer) in connection with the Company\u2019s March 29, 2021 proxy statement; (2) breaches of fiduciary duty against all Individual Defendants in connection with disclosures made regarding the teplizumab BLA and teplizumab\u2019s commercialization timeline, among other common law causes of action; and (3) seek contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act against Ashleigh Palmer and Andrew Drechsler in connection with the Securities Action. The Derivative Actions seek unspecified damages, including legal fees associated with the Securities Action and compensation paid to the Individual Defendants. The Derivative Actions also seek an order directing the Company and Individual Defendants to take all necessary actions to reform and improve the Company\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures.\nProceedings in the first Derivative Action, filed August 5, 2021, were originally stayed until November 15, 2021. On October 28, 2021, both plaintiffs and all defendants in the Derivative Actions filed a joint stipulation and proposed order to consolidate the Derivative Actions and appoint co-lead counsel, which the Court granted on November 1, 2021. The consolidation order extended the stay of proceedings to both Derivative Actions. In response to the parties\u2019 joint stipulation to continue the temporary stay of the proceedings, filed on November 15, 2021, the Court granted a further temporary stay of the Derivative Actions until December 30, 2021. On December 10, 2021, the Company and the Individual Defendants moved to extend the temporary stay of proceedings in the Derivative Actions pending the resolution of a motion to dismiss in the Securities Action. Plaintiffs do not oppose the relief sought in motion to stay. On January 4, 2022, the Court stayed proceedings in the Derivative Actions until resolution of the motion to stay, which remains pending before the Court.\nThese lawsuits and these types of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not develop, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nPrior to our IPO, there was no public market for shares of our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity and an active public market for our shares may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair the ability to sell shares at the time a shareholder wish to sell them or at a price that a shareholder may consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications, or technologies using our shares as consideration.\nWe have incurred increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is now required to devote substantial time to additional compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nFuture capital raises may dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership and/or have other adverse effects on our operations.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership will be reduced, and these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 24.7% of our voting stock as of December 31, 2021. Therefore, these stockholders may have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. For example, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they may be able to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIn accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and our policies regarding stock transactions, a number of our employees, including executive officers, have adopted and may continue to adopt stock trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our common stock from time to time in the future. Generally, sales under such plans by our executive officers and directors require public filings. Sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by holders and potential purchasers of our common stock, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 15.6 million shares of common stock were subject to outstanding options, reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans or subject to outstanding warrants. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decrease.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting\nIf we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if we are unable to provide an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and provisions under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contains provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u25cf the required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u25cf the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, or at the request of holders of record of at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, these provisions would apply even if we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our bylaws became effective immediately prior to the completion of the IPO and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u25cf we will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful;\n\u25cf we may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;\n\u25cf we are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;\n\u25cf we will not be obligated pursuant to our bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification;\n\u25cf the rights conferred in our bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and\n\u25cf we may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction.\nThe choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, the ability to achieve a return on investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, shareholders are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, the ability to receive a return on investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs our development and commercialization plans and strategies continue to develop, we intend to expand the size of our employee and consultant/contractor base. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and any other future product candidates and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our future growth.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. In addition, the loss of the services of our co-founders would adversely impact our business prospects.\nOur management team has expertise in many different aspects of drug development and commercialization. However, our ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We will need to hire additional personnel as we further develop our product candidates. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and competition for experienced scientists may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. However, these employment arrangements will provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. Moreover, there can be no assurance that anyone we expect to employ in a key management position will be available to join our team when we expect them to, if at all. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees, or our inability to hire targeted executives, could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. In particular, we believe that the loss of the services of our co-founders would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nOther pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates would be limited.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face a potential risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any of our product candidates or any other future product. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop, including any of our product candidates, or any materials that we use in our products allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. In the United States, claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any of our product candidates or any future products that we may develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize some or all of our product candidates; and\n\u25cf a decline in the value of our stock.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We maintain product liability insurance covering our clinical trials. Although we will maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe may acquire businesses or products, or form strategic alliances, in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction.\nWe are generally a virtual company and may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyber-attacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nWe are a virtual company and may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyber-attacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nCyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, and other means to threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. A successful cyber-attack could cause serious negative consequences for our company, including the disruption of operations, the misappropriation of confidential business information and trade secrets, and the disclosure of corporate strategic plans. To date, we have not experienced threats to our data and information technology systems. However, although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems, we realize that cyber-attacks are a threat, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal or reputational harm to us, or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of our information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach or disruption of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The form and function of such systems may change over time as our business needs change. The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal and financial information regarding our customers. We use our information technology systems to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing and accounts payable. In addition, we use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize transactions and other financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions, disruptions or shutdowns, could result in the unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets or the loss of key data and information, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. If our information technology systems are breached or suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of our patient, employee, supplier or Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation, enforcement actions and reputational damage.\nOur business, like that of most biopharmaceutical companies, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of patient information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company. Our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees or third-party service providers. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information and device security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. The ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and our efforts may not be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, misuse of data or sabotage of our systems. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of patient, employee, supplier or Company data, could result in additional significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits and damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nWe are subject to stringent privacy laws, information security laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security and changes in such laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of personally-identifying information, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of personal information, including comprehensive regulatory systems in the United States, UK and European Union. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve in jurisdictions worldwide, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nThere are numerous United States federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended, and its implementing regulations establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. While we have determined that we are neither a \u201ccovered entity\u201d nor a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d directly subject to HIPAA, many of the United States health care providers, including United States clinical trial sites, with which we interact are subject to HIPAA, and we have assumed contractual obligations related to protecting the privacy of personal information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be complex and may be subject to changing interpretation. If we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information, we could be found to have breached our contracts and we could face civil and criminal penalties. In addition, our operations have been affected by the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask covered companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer\u2019s personal information, the categories of third parties with whom a covered company shares personal information, and specific pieces of information collected by a covered company. The CCPA imposes several obligations on covered companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding their data processing activities. The CCPA also gives California consumers the right to ask covered companies to delete a consumer\u2019s personal information and it places limitations on a covered company\u2019s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information.\nIn addition, we may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, the processing of personal data in the EEA and the UK, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, responding to data subjects who exercise their rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals. The GDPR also requires us to enter certain contractual arrangements with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the European Commission to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The July 2020 invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union of the EU-United States Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, and the imposition of restrictions on the use of other transfer mechanisms made such transfer more complex and challenging and have also led to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EEA to the United States generally and may increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation. In June 2021, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a ruling that expanded the scope of the \u201cone stop shop\u201d under the GDPR. According to the ruling, the competent authorities of European Union Member States may, under certain strict conditions, bring claims to their national courts against a company for breaches of the GDPR, including unlawful cross-border processing activities, even such company does not have an establishment in the European Union member state in question and the competent authority bringing the claim is not the lead supervisory authority. If our or our partners\u2019 or service providers\u2019 privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as claims by affected individuals, negative publicity, reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill.\nData privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges, and our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems. Our efforts to comply may also be unsuccessful. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities in the European Union, the UK, and elsewhere and carries with it the potential for significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. Similarly, failure to comply with federal and state laws in the United States regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to penalties under such laws. Any such failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages by data subjects, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We only recently obtained research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If there are insufficient securities or industry analysts covering us, the market price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 17973, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PRVB"}
