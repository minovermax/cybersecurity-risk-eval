Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing in this report. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. If any of the following risks actually occur, they may materially harm our business and our financial condition and results of operations. In this event, the market price of our common stock could decline and your investment could be lost. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have limited operating history. To date, we have focused primarily on developing injectable meloxicam and Dex-IN. In addition, we have other product candidates, Dex-SL and Fado, in development and may acquire or develop other product candidates in the future. We have incurred significant pre-tax losses in each year since our inception in November 2007, including pre-tax losses of approximately $12.5 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $31.1 million.\nUntil April 2015, we had devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our nonclinical and formulation development activities, product candidate manufacturing and clinical trials. Since April 2015, in addition to the continuation of the above activities for our product candidates, we have used revenue produced by our Gainesville manufacturing business to make payments under our credit facility with OrbiMed. Through December 31, 2015, we have financed our operations through the sale of debt and equity securities and a $50.0 million credit facility. We believe that the Gainesville manufacturing business\u2019s commercial revenue will continue to contribute cash for general corporate purposes that may, to some extent, reduce the amount of external capital needed to fund development operations.\nThe size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate additional revenues. To date, none of our product candidates have been commercialized, and revenues generated by our manufacturing business do not cover our costs. If our product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenues are insufficient following marketing approval, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates in the United States, our revenues are also dependent upon the size of the markets outside of the United States, as well as our ability to obtain market approval and achieve commercial success.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we expand our research and development activities and advance our clinical programs. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses from operations for the foreseeable future.\nWe have only recently begun to generate revenue through our acquisition of the contract manufacturing facility, royalty and formulation business in the Gainesville Transaction but we may never be profitable.\nOur ability to achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for and commercialize our product candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of our product candidates for the foreseeable future, if ever. Although we generate revenue through our subsidiary\u2019s contract manufacturing, royalty and formulation business, such revenue may never be sufficient to achieve profitability. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022\ncompleting the clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlaunching and commercializing our product candidates through either building a specialty sales force or collaborating with third parties; and\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent protection.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, and when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. For example, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA to perform studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate.\nEven if one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate unless we enter into a strategic partnership for the launch and commercialization of our product candidates. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance or evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe were incorporated in 2007. Since inception, our operations have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking non-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates. We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of\nour product candidates. In addition, our contract manufacturing business was acquired in April 2015, and our experience operating such business is limited. Consequently, we have a very limited amount of information to use in evaluating the potential future success or viability of our business and any such evaluation of our business and prospects may not be accurate.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. Prior to commercializing any of our product candidates, we expect that any expenses or revenues we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of (i) the timing and amount of development milestones and royalty revenues received or paid under our collaboration license agreements, as these revenues or payments from the arrangements are principally based on the achievement of clinical and commercial milestones outside of our control, and (ii) the revenues generated by our contract manufacturing business, which may fluctuate significantly.\nIf we commercialize one or more of our products, our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n\u2022\nthe success of our clinical trials through all phases of clinical development;\n\u2022\nany delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development;\n\u2022\npotential side effects of our future products that could delay or prevent commercialization or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patent protection;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u2022\nour dependency on third parties to supply and manufacture our product candidates and delivery devices;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting our products and product candidates, which are not limited to but could include the imposition of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program as a condition of approval;\n\u2022\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe achievement and timing of milestone payments under our existing collaboration and license agreements; and\n\u2022\nthe level of market acceptance for any approved product candidates and underlying demand for that product and wholesalers\u2019 buying patterns.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nIf we fail to obtain sufficient additional financing, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or to significantly scale back or discontinue our manufacturing business.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. We expect our research and development expenses to substantially increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our clinical programs. In addition, maintaining a world class cGMP pharmaceutical manufacturing facility is expensive. While our contract manufacturing business generates revenue, that revenue alone is not sufficient to support our product development operations. We will need to raise additional funds to support our future product development operations. In addition, we may also need to obtain additional financing if the capital requirements for operating and maintaining our manufacturing facility exceed our current expectations. Such financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOn February 2, 2015, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, or Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase, at our election, up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of our shares of common stock over the approximately 24-month term of the Purchase Agreement. During the first quarter of 2016, we sold 93,940 shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement for proceeds of $560,000.\nWe expect our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operations through March 31, 2017. However, changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. For example, our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expect. We will need to raise additional funding to file an NDA for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates or otherwise enter into collaborations to launch and commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates after receipt of FDA approval, if received, and, if we choose, to initiate clinical trials for additional uses of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates. The extent to which we utilize the Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock, the volume of trading in our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure funds from other sources. The number of shares that we may sell to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement on any given day and during the term of the agreement is limited. Even if we are able to access the remaining $9.4 million under the Purchase Agreement, we will still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans.\nSecuring additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or to develop and maintain customer relationships. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u2022\ncurtail the development programs for our product candidates or significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek corporate partners for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license, on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or\n\u2022\nsignificantly scale back or discontinue our manufacturing business.\nAny of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which would result in dilution to our shareholders and impose restrictions on our business.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of such financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing shareholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIn connection with the Gainesville Transaction, we incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business.\nPrior to the Gainesville Transaction in April 2015, we had no outstanding indebtedness. Contemporaneously with the closing of the Gainesville Transaction, we entered into a $50.0 million credit agreement with OrbiMed. As of December 31, 2015, we had an outstanding balance under the credit agreement of $33.7 million. Accordingly, we have substantially increased indebtedness following the acquisition in comparison to a recent historical basis. The credit agreement also provides for certain mandatory prepayment events, including a quarterly excess cash flow prepayment requirement at OrbiMed\u2019s request, based on the terms of the credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $16.3 million of the outstanding principal on our senior secured term loan from free cash flow generated by Gainesville.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it:\n\u2022\nrequires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.;\n\u2022\nincreases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmakes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nplaces us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our credit agreement with OrbiMed also contains certain financial and other covenants, including a minimum liquidity requirement and minimum revenue targets, maximum leverage ratios and includes limitations on, among other things, additional indebtedness, paying dividends in certain circumstances, acquisitions and certain investments. Any failure to comply with the terms, covenants and conditions of the term loan may result in an event of default under such agreements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nFurther, subject to compliance with our credit agreement with OrbiMed, we have the ability to incur additional indebtedness, which would exacerbate the risks associated with our existing debt.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nWe depend substantially on the success of our product candidates, which are still under clinical development, and which may not obtain regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nWe have not marketed, distributed or sold any products. The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. IV meloxicam, our lead product candidate, has successfully completed multiple Phase II clinical trials and is currently being studied in pivotal Phase III clinical trials for the management of acute post-operative pain. Based on feedback from the FDA, in January 2016, we initiated a Phase III program that includes two pivotal clinical trials, as well as other trials. We plan to pursue Dex-IN, as we discussed with the FDA, in peri-procedural pain. We intend to use these trials as a basis to submit an NDA for injectable meloxicam and Dex-IN. There is no guarantee that our clinical trials will be completed, or if completed, will be successful. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, regulatory approval would prevent us from commercializing each of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates, generating revenues from our product candidates and achieving profitability. If this were to occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nWe depend substantially on the successful completion of Phase II and III clinical trials for our product candidates. The positive clinical results obtained for our product candidates in earlier clinical studies may not be repeated in Phase II or III and, thus, we may never receive regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe, or our predecessors, have completed multiple clinical studies utilizing IV meloxicam and Dex-IN. We are currently conducting Phase III clinical trials of IV meloxicam for the management of acute post-operative pain. We also intend to conduct further clinical trials for Dex-IN for the management of peri-procedural pain. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must successfully complete Phase III clinical trials. Negative or inconclusive results of a Phase III clinical trial could cause the FDA to require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical trials. Any regulatory delays or request for additional clinical data will lead to new and costly expenditures and could cause delays in our drug development. There is no guarantee that our clinical trials will be completed, or if completed, will be successful.\nTo date, we, or our predecessor, have completed multiple Phase II clinical trials with IV meloxicam and Dex-IN. However, there is no certainty that the results we have seen in these trials and in the patient population that we evaluated will be similar in our ongoing and future expected clinical trials. We cannot be certain that positive results will be duplicated when IV meloxicam is tested in larger number of patients or that Dex-IN will be successful when targeting peri-procedural pain. Unexpected results could require us to conduct additional clinical trials in the same or different patient populations or discontinue clinical development of injectable meloxicam or Dex-IN. If we are forced to discontinue development of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or any of our other product candidates because of unsuccessful clinical trials, we will not be able to commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates or the time required to complete clinical trials for our product candidates may be longer than anticipated. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in a Phase II study required prior to Phase III initiation;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by toxicology studies required prior to Phase III initiation;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by unexpected results or unforeseen problems with any clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement with the FDA on final trial design or the scope of the development program;\n\u2022\nimport delays;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the device components of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new clinical sites;\n\u2022\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver a sufficient supply of clinical trial materials; or\n\u2022\ndelays or problems caused by third parties who market our product candidates for other indications.\nIf completion of the Phase III clinical trials for injectable meloxicam, the initiation of the clinical trials for Dex-IN in peri procedural pain or other clinical trials for our other product candidates is delayed for any of the above reasons or other reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur product candidates may cause adverse events or other safety concerns or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nAEs caused by our product candidates could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical study sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. Clinical studies conducted with IV meloxicam, Dex and other product candidates have generated some AEs, and in some cases serious adverse events, or SAEs, as those terms are defined by the FDA in its regulations. Our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted by these AEs, SAEs or other safety concerns. Further, if our products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in a form of a modified REMS;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and/or\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nAfter the completion of our clinical trials, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates, and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates.\nWe cannot commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates until the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, have reviewed and approved the product candidate. The regulatory authorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or they may not provide regulatory approval for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates. Additional delays may result if injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates are taken before an FDA Advisory Committee, which may recommend restrictions on approval or recommend that one or more product candidates not be approved. For example, our development timeline for Dex-IN has been delayed due to our decision, based on feedback from the FDA, not to pursue a Phase III program in post-operative pain and instead to study Dex-IN in peri-procedural pain. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. Such delays or rejections could have an adverse effect on our business.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates, in which case we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize any of our products candidates will depend on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully complete our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nreceive marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain patent protection;\n\u2022\nproduce, through a validated process, sufficiently large quantities of our product candidates to permit successful commercialization;\n\u2022\nestablish commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nbuild and maintain strong U.S.-based sales, distribution and marketing capabilities sufficient to launch commercial sales of our product candidates or build collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of our product candidates within the United States;\n\u2022\nestablish collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of our product candidates in countries outside the United States, and such collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in such countries;\n\u2022\nsecure acceptance of our product candidates by physicians, health care payors, patients and the medical community; and\n\u2022\nmanage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to commercialization and clinical trials.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. If we are unable to successfully complete these tasks, we may not be able to commercialize any of our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, in which case we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business. In addition, if we experience unanticipated delays or problems, development costs could substantially increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the FDA and state regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-marketing surveillance. For example, the labeling ultimately approved for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates will likely include restrictions regarding, among other items, the number of doses to be dispensed or the number of permissible distribution routes, until we have satisfied all FDA requests for additional data to support broader usage. Injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-marketing information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report AEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of substantial user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, suspension of manufacturing, or other FDA action.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our product candidates, a regulatory authority may:\n\u2022\nissue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve a pending NDA or supplements to an NDA submitted by us;\n\u2022\nseize our product candidate; and/or\n\u2022\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity in addition to the aforementioned potential regulatory actions. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FDA may require us to provide more dosing data regarding injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates.\nThe FDA may require us to provide additional dosing data beyond current data and data from our Phase II and Phase III clinical trials and to establish the proper dosage or dose frequency for injectable meloxicam or Dex-IN before it approves any of these product candidates. The preparation of this additional data may be costly and may delay the approval of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or any of our other product candidates for which we receive this request. If we cannot satisfy the FDA requirements, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval.\nInjectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates may require REMS, which may significantly increase our costs.\nThe FDA Amendments Act of 2007 implemented safety-related changes to product labeling and requires the adoption of REMS for certain products. Based on the FDA\u2019s actions with many products, our product candidates may require REMS. The REMS may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients, special communication plans to health care professionals and restrictions on distribution and use. We cannot predict the specific scope or magnitude of REMS to be required as part of the FDA\u2019s approval of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates. Depending on the extent of the REMS requirements, our costs to commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates may increase significantly and distribution restrictions could limit sales.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates in the United States, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize our products outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. While our management has experience in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals, we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we, as a company, do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approval in international markets is delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be adversely affected.\nAdditional time may be required to obtain regulatory approval for Dex-IN because the FDA may consider it a drug/device combination.\nDex-IN may be considered by the FDA to be a drug/device combination. While we have filed an IND for Dex-IN, we cannot guarantee that the FDA will not require a separate device review. There are a number of drugs such as Zecuity\u00ae and Sprix\u00ae that employ a device that have received approval as drugs. The third-party device we intend to use has previously received a device authorization. We have not taken any action, and although we plan to address such matter with the FDA in the future, we do not have a targeted date to do so, because we believe our device will be treated similarly to such other drugs. Because we cannot guarantee this result, however, we may experience delays in regulatory approval for Dex-IN due to potential uncertainties in the approval process, in particular as the FDA may require device authorization by NDA approval. As a result, product launch and commercialization may be delayed or may not occur, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on limited sources of supply for the drug component of our product candidates, and any disruption in the chain of supply may cause delay in developing and commercializing our product candidates.\nAlkermes is currently our sole supplier of bulk injectable meloxicam formulation, and we intend to enter into an agreement with a contract manufacturer for the provision of sterile fill and finish services. Orion is currently our sole source of the API for Dex. Although the supply agreements that we have with Alkermes and Orion allow us to qualify and purchase from an alternative supplier in certain circumstances, it would be time-consuming and expensive for us to do so, and there can be no assurance that an alternative supplier could be found. Currently, Alkermes and Orion are the only established suppliers of bulk injectable meloxicam formulation and Dex API, respectively.\nWe expect that the drug product (dosage form that is the final product) for Dex-IN will be manufactured by a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO. There are only a small number of manufacturers with the capability to produce the Dex-IN product and fill the intranasal sprayers that are needed for the product. We expect to enter into an agreement with an intranasal delivery device company that will supply the components of the intranasal sprayer to the CMO for filling after they have made the formulated drug product. Currently, there is only one supplier for the filled and finished intranasal sprayer that we intend to use.\nIf supply from our suppliers, any CMO or any device component supplier is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial or clinical supply of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates. The FDA, state regulatory authorities or other regulatory authorities outside of the United States may also require additional studies if any new suppliers are relied upon for commercial production. In addition, failure of our suppliers or vendors to comply with applicable regulations may result in delays and interruptions to our product candidate supply while we seek to secure other suppliers that meet all regulatory requirements.\nAny interruption in the supply of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing them successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required quantities of the drug component of our product candidates on a timely basis and at all, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\nManufacture of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates require specialized equipment and expertise, the disruption of which may cause delays and increased costs.\nThere are a limited number of machines and facilities that can accommodate our filling and assembly process, and for certain parts of the process, we need to use dedicated or disposable equipment throughout development and commercial manufacturing. If this equipment breaks down or needs to be repaired or replaced, it may cause significant disruption in clinical or commercial supply, which could result in delay in the process of obtaining approval for or sale of our products. Any problems with our existing manufacturing facility or equipment may delay or impair our ability to complete our clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates and increase our costs.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization.\nAs we scale up manufacturing of our product candidates and conduct required stability testing, product-packaging, equipment and process-related issues may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials and to obtain regulatory approval for commercial marketing. We may identify issues in our product or delivery devices, which could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, delays in our clinical program and regulatory approvals, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products.\nWe use third parties, including Malvern Consulting Group, Inc., an entity with which our management is affiliated, to assist with conducting, supervising and monitoring portions of our clinical studies, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe use third parties, including Malvern Consulting Group, Inc., or MCG, to provide certain manufacturing and operational support. We use other third parties for assistance with clinical trials, data management and statistical support. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over certain of these third parties\u2019 actual performance. We have previously relied upon such third parties and plan to continue to use third parties to assist with monitoring and managing data for our ongoing clinical programs for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates, as well as the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our third parties activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our use of third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe and our contractors are required to comply with current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our product candidates in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our contractors fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of each product candidate. Accordingly, if our contractors fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat the clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nThese contractors may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies, or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by our contractors, which may allow our potential competitors to access our proprietary technology. If our contractors do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines for items within their purview, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they oversee is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN, or our other product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and any future product candidates that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nThe commercial success of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.\nPhysicians may not prescribe any of our product candidates if approved by the FDA, in which case we would not generate the revenues we anticipate. The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any AEs;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which each of our product candidates are approved, including any potential additional restrictions placed on each product candidate in connection with its approval;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved label for each product candidate;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nprevalence of the condition for which each product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments and perceived advantages of our product candidates over such alternative treatments;\n\u2022\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022\nour ability to convince hospitals to include injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates on their list of authorized products, referred to as formulary approval;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.\nIf injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or any of our other product candidates are approved, but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payors, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not become or remain profitable.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe currently do not have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates, and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We intend to enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States. We will also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for certain product candidates in the United States.\nTo date, we have not entered into any strategic partnerships for any of our product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and these strategic partnerships can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any strategic partnerships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships. Our strategy for injectable meloxicam and Dex-IN is to develop a specialty sales force and/or collaborate with third parties to promote the product to healthcare professionals and third party payors in the United States. Our future collaboration partners, if any, may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of our product candidates to healthcare professionals and in geographic regions, including the United States, that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our product candidates, our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to negotiate a strategic partnership or obtain additional financial resources for our other product candidates, we may be forced to curtail the development of them, delay potential commercialization, reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities or undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. In addition, without a partnership, we will bear all the risk related to the development of these other product candidates. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our other product candidates to market or generate product revenue.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nWe are subject to intense competition and, if we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may not reach their commercial potential.\nThe market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If our product candidates obtain FDA approval, they will compete with a number of existing and future pharmaceuticals and drug delivery devices developed, manufactured and marketed by others. We will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.\nIn the post-operative pain and peri-procedural pain relief setting, we believe injectable meloxicam will be prescribed for moderate to severe pain, competing mostly with opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl. There are a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently market therapeutics in the pain relief area, including Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma L.P., Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mallinckrodt plc. and Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Purdue and Endo are the primary competitors in the manufacture, marketing and commercialization of opioid therapeutics. Mallinckrodt commercializes an injectable formulation of acetaminophen. Pacira commercializes an intraoperative formulation of bupivacaine, a sodium channel blocker. As far as potential competitors in development of product candidates for peri-procedural pain, such as Dex-IN, we are not aware of any other alpha-2 agonists compounds in development for this area. However, companies such as Adynxx, Inc., AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Heron Therapeutics, Inc., Trevena, Inc. and Cara Therapeutics, Inc. are currently developing post-operative pain therapeutics that could compete with us in the future.\nIn cancer breakthrough pain relief, we expect to compete against established companies, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., Kyowa Hakko, Insys Therapeutics Inc. and Depomed, Inc. All of these potential competitors have various formulations of fentanyl, a fast-acting opioid. We are not aware of any non-fentanyl related therapeutics in development for the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain.\nIt is possible that any of these competitors could develop or improve technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive, which could adversely affect our revenue potential. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.\nMany of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u2022\ncapital resources;\n\u2022\nresearch and development resources and experience, including personnel and technology;\n\u2022\ndrug development, clinical trial and regulatory resources and experience;\n\u2022\nsales and marketing resources and experience;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and distribution resources and experience;\n\u2022\nname recognition; and\n\u2022\nresources, experience and expertise in prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nAccordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining FDA approval for product candidates in the pain management and relief space and achieving widespread market acceptance of these products. Our competitors\u2019 drugs or drug delivery systems may be more effective, have fewer AEs, be less expensive to develop and manufacture or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize. This may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover our losses. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and additional technologies become available in the pain management and relief space. These entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors, which may adversely affect our competitive position. Finally, the development of different methods for the treatment of acute pain following surgery or breakthrough pain, or of peri-procedural pain, could render injectable meloxicam or Dex-IN, respectively, non-competitive or obsolete. These and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations.\nHospital formulary approval and reimbursement may not be available for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and our other product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nFailure to obtain timely hospital formulary approval will limit our commercial success. Obtaining hospital formulary approval can be an expensive and time consuming process. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain the formulary approval to allow us to sell our products into our target markets.\nFurthermore, market acceptance and sales of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN, or any future product candidates that we develop, will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers, hospitals and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN, or any future product candidates. Also, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN, or any future product candidates that we develop.\nThe availability of numerous generic pain medications may substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or our other product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN and any other product candidates that we develop, due to the trend toward managed healthcare and the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products, or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize our products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or other product candidates outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires. The realization of any of these risks would negatively affect our ability to attain or sustain profitability.\nUpon commercialization of any of our product candidates, we will become subject to a variety of additional risks applicable to companies engaged in the distribution of pharmaceuticals.\nAlthough we do not expect to commercialize our product candidates for several years, if and when we do, we will be subject to a variety of additional risks. In particular, upon commercialization of our product candidates, our relationships with third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nIn addition, over the past few years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a company\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialization of injectable meloxicam, Dex, or any of our future products, and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN, or any of our future products, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidate, assuming we obtain marketing approval.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA or state regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN or any other product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any of which could negatively impact our business. A significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become effective, but the Affordable Care Act is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical and medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nRisks Related to Our Commercial Manufacturing Business\nRevenues from our manufacturing business are dependent on a small number of commercial partners, and the loss of one of these partners, or a decline in their orders, may adversely affect our business.\nOur manufacturing business is currently dependent on our relationships with our commercial partners. We currently have five key commercial partners: Novartis Pharma AG (Ritalin LA\u00ae, Focalin XR\u00ae), Actavis (generic\nVerapamil), Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Verelan PM\u00ae), Pernix Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Zohydro ER\u00ae) and Paladin Labs Inc. (Kodessa/Zohydro ER\u00ae). Our contracts with our commercial partners are for a short term, generally one year. If any one or more of these commercial partners fails to renew their contract or otherwise significantly reduces their purchasing volume our revenues could be adversely affected. We also work with companies to develop and manufacture development stage products.\nManufacturing revenues also depend on the ability of our commercial partners to effectively market and sell their products to their customers. A commercial partner may choose to devote its efforts to its other products or reduce or fail to devote the necessary resources to provide effective sales and marketing support of the products we manufacture and supply. Our commercial partners face competition from other pharmaceutical companies for sales of products to end users. Competition from sellers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our commercial partners, and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights for the products we manufacture can have a significant adverse effect on their sales volume. This and any other significant reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from our commercial partners could adversely affect our revenues.\nIn addition, the financial covenants in our credit agreement with OrbiMed include minimum revenue targets for Gainesville, and any significant reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from our commercial partners may cause us to fail to meet such targets, which may result in an event of default under the credit agreement with OrbiMed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to risks related to large-scale commercial manufacturing.\nManufacturing pharmaceuticals, especially in large quantities, is complex. The products we manufacture for our commercial partners require several manufacturing steps and may involve complex techniques to assure quality and sufficient quantity. Our manufactured products must be made consistently and in compliance with a clearly defined manufacturing process. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including obtaining materials, equipment malfunctions, filling, labeling, packaging, storage, shipping, quality control and testing, some of which all pharmaceutical manufacturing companies experience from time to time, may result in lot failures, delay in the release of lots, product recalls or spoilage. Success rates can vary dramatically at different stages of the manufacturing process, which can lower yields and increase costs.\nIn addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers and pharmaceutical wholesalers to provide the raw materials needed for the manufacture of our commercial products. We may experience deviations in the manufacturing process or interruptions in our supply chain that may take significant time and resources to resolve and, if unresolved, may affect manufacturing output and/or cause us to fail to satisfy customer orders or contractual commitments or result in litigation or regulatory action.\nOur manufacturing facility also requires specialized personnel and is expensive to operate and maintain. Any suspension of the sale of products of our commercial partners to be manufactured in our facility may cause operating losses as we continue to operate the facility and retain specialized personnel. In addition, any interruption in manufacturing could result in delays in meeting our contractual obligations and could damage our relationships with our commercial partners, including the loss of manufacturing and supply rights.\nIf we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, we could incur substantial costs and a reduction in revenues.\nWe are required to maintain compliance with cGMP, and our manufacturing facility is subject to inspections by the FDA and other global regulators to confirm such compliance. Changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application(s) to the FDA and acceptance of the change by the FDA prior to release of our manufactured products. Because we produce multiple products at our manufacturing facility, there are increased risks associated with cGMP compliance. Our inability to demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance could require us to engage in lengthy and expensive remediation efforts, withdraw or recall products and/or interrupt commercial supply of any products. Any delay, interruption or other issue that arises in the manufacture, fill/finish, packaging, or storage of any drug product as a result of a failure of our facility to pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cGMP compliance could significantly impair our relationships with our commercial partners, which would substantially harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Any finding of non-compliance could also increase our costs and cause us to lose revenue from manufactured products, which could be seriously detrimental to our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our manufacturing activities are subject to the Controlled Substances Act and the regulations of the DEA. Accordingly, we must adhere to a number of requirements with respect to controlled substances, including registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; labeling and packaging requirements; security controls, procurement and manufacturing quotas; and certain restrictions on refills. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.\nWe and our third-party suppliers must comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nIn connection with our manufacturing business, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies concerning the environment and the health and safety of our employees. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nIn addition, our manufacturing business involves the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals, solvents, agents and biohazardous materials. As a result, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by those regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. We currently contract with third parties to dispose of these substances that we generate, and we rely on these third parties to properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If these third parties do not properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to legal action by governmental agencies or private parties for improper disposal of these substances. The costs of defending such actions and the potential liability resulting from such actions are often very large. In the event we are subject to such legal action or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, including those resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other events that disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur manufacturing facility is located in Gainesville, Georgia, where natural disasters or similar events, like blizzards, tornadoes, fires, floods or explosions or large-scale accidents or power outages, could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. If a disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our Gainesville facility, damaged critical infrastructure, such as manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or otherwise disrupted operations at that location, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our manufacturing business for a substantial period of time.\nCurrently, we maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and equipment, and to cover business interruption expenses, in an amount we believe is sufficient for our manufacturing operations. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against actual losses. Even if we maintain adequate insurance coverage, claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on our ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain and have the full attention of our key executives as well as to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive team and, in particular, the services of Gerri A. Henwood, our President and Chief Executive Officer, the loss of whose services would adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. We expect some of our executive officers to spend a very small portion of their time engaged in the provision of services to other companies, including companies that are engaged in the development and commercialization of other pharmaceutical products. Recruiting and retaining qualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee could impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe may need to significantly expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations and cause additional costs to us.\nWe currently use third parties, including MCG, to perform certain of our operational activities, and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. However, as our company matures, we may choose to expand our employee base to increase our managerial, scientific and engineering, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors. Future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our possible growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize injectable meloxicam, Dex-IN, and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer, Gerri A. Henwood, is also the majority shareholder of MCG, our landlord.\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Henwood, owns a majority of the stock of MCG. Ms. Henwood continues to devote a very small portion of her time to MCG. Ms. Henwood provides services to, or on behalf of, MCG on an as needed basis. Although Ms. Henwood has no obligation to devote a specified amount of time to MCG, we expect that Ms. Henwood will devote up to 5% of her time to MCG.\nWe sublease our facilities from MCG. MCG also provides certain services, including administrative, regulatory and manufacturing services, to us that are important to our success and programs. We have a Sublease and a Consulting Services Agreement in effect with MCG that we believe is on arm\u2019s length terms. However, upon expiration or earlier termination (for breach or otherwise) of these agreements, there is no guarantee that MCG will continue to make the current space available to us and/or to perform the current services or that it will do so on terms that meet our needs.\nMCG also provides services to third parties, including other companies that are developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Because Ms. Henwood has ownership of MCG and operational control of our company, she could be in a conflicted situation between us and MCG and, therefore, may not be able to advance our interests to the extent that they would be in conflict with those of MCG.\nOur employees, partners, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and contract research organizations may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, partners, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and contract research organizations, or CROs, may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity with respect to our business. Misconduct by these employees could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: (1) FDA or DEA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; (2) manufacturing standards; (3) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any incidents or any other conduct that leads to an employee receiving an FDA debarment could result in a loss of business from our partners and severe reputational harm. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face potential product liability claims, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. In addition, our manufacturing business exposes us to potential toxic tort and other\ntypes of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation and negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our manufacturing services or loss of any of our commercial partners;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale; and/or\n\u2022\nincreased scrutiny and potential investigation by, among others, the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, State Attorneys General, members of Congress and the public.\nOur current product liability insurance coverage of $10.0 million may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated AEs. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon our management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nWe are a public company and, as such, we have begun and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including certain of the requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the NASDAQ Capital Market, the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. If we fail to comply with current corporate governance requirements, our business may be negatively affected, including by having our common stock delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nThe expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically in recent years. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We are unable to currently estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We also expect that these rules and regulations may make it difficult and expensive for us to continue to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and if we are able to maintain such insurance, we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage available to privately-held companies. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors, or the board, or as our executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be frequently evaluated. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors (the latter requirement does not apply to smaller reporting companies-we qualify as a smaller reporting company). Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised, and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks. As part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on patients and our employees. Breaches in security could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, interruption to our operations, damage to our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have appropriate information security policies and systems in place in order to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe own or license numerous pending patent applications and issued patents in the United States. If our pending patent applications fail to issue or if our issued patents expire or are successfully opposed, invalidated, or rendered unenforceable, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, as well as successfully defending our current and future patents against third party challenges. To protect our proprietary technology, we intend to rely on patents, and we may also rely on other intellectual property protections, including trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality provisions.\nThere can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents. As of December 31, 2015, we own and license patents and patent applications directed to the sale, use, manufacturing and formulating of injectable meloxicam. The patent protection for injectable meloxicam could lead to protection of injectable meloxicam through 2030, subject to any extensions or disclaimers. As of December 31, 2015, we own three patents relating to Zohydro-ER\u00ae, which have expiration dates of November 1, 2019, November 1, 2019, and September 12, 2034. We also own Canadian patent applications that are still pending relating to the same technology, which we license to our commercial partner, Paladin Labs Inc., in Canada. As of December 31, 2015, we are the owner of record of two issued U.S. patents related to Fado and four issued foreign patents to Dex. As of December 31, 2015, we are also the owner of record and are prosecuting four U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 52 foreign national patent applications related to either Dex or Fado. In addition, we have recently received ownership from Orion of one issued U.S. patent and 49 granted foreign patents (including numerous European Patent Office member and extension states as well as Eurasian members) related to a pro-drug of Fado. The patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents or the inventorship thereof, which can lead to an issued patent being found invalid, unenforceable or can otherwise alter the ownership of the patents.\nThe issuance of any patent is not a certainty. Unless and until our pending applications issue, their protective scope is impossible to determine. It is impossible to predict whether or how many of these applications will result in issued patents and patents that issue may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of patent exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which may limit our ability to prevent others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. In addition, upon expiration of a patent, we may be limited in our ability to prevent others from using or commercializing subject matter covered by the expired patents. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. The composition of matter patents for Dex and Fado are licensed from Orion. The composition of matter patent for Dex expired in January 2014, and the composition of matter patent for Fado will expire in October 2016. The composition of matter patent for a single pro-drug of Fado will expire in April 2025. If no additional patent protection is obtained, these patent expirations will impact our ability to prevent third parties from marketing generic equivalents.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us, generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the first filing, or in some case at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of patents or narrow the scope of patent protection.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent Office continues to develop and implement new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patent, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe do not own worldwide rights to all of our product candidates or the exclusive rights to all formulations.\nWe own worldwide rights to injectable meloxicam. We have an exclusive license from Orion for the development and, subsequent to approval, the commercialization of Dex-IN for use in the treatment of pain in humans the Licensed Dosage Forms, but specifically excluding delivery vehicles for administration by injection or infusion, in the Territory. Orion retains the rights to develop and commercialize Dex for all uses and indications other than pain in humans and for use in combination products in that field, and we have granted Orion a license to use our clinical trial data, patents and know-how for such purpose; provided, however that Orion cannot undertake development activities in the United States, Australia or South Africa with respect to treatment of pain in humans in any Licensed Dosage Form until four years after our first product is granted regulatory approval in the United States. It is possible, therefore, that Orion may develop and commercialize competing products in the territories retained by it and/or combination products for Dex in the Territory. We are unaware of any such programs at Orion at this time. We have a right of first refusal to commercialize any such product developed by Orion in the Territory. However, there is no guarantee that we would have the resources to exercise this right or, if we did, that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with Orion.\nLitigation involving patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing our product candidates to market and interfere with our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Although we are not currently aware of litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.\nAs we enter our target markets, it is possible that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products and/or processes infringe their intellectual property rights. These third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents covering products or processes that are similar to, or may include compositions or methods that encompass our technology, allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents. If such third party patent is listed in the Orange Book, we would be required to file a certification, known as a Paragraph IV certification, that we are not infringing the patent, or that the patent is invalid. The third party would then have 45 days to file a patent infringement lawsuit against us, and if so brought, we could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months (unless before that time the patent expires or is judged to be invalid or not infringed), in which we would be unable to have our 505(b)(2) application approved.\nIn a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents and/or our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a low burden of proof.\nIf we were found by a court to have infringed a valid patent claim, we could be prevented from using the patented technology or be required to pay the owner of the patent for the right to license the patented technology. If we decide to pursue a license to one or more of these patents, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or the license we obtain may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patent rights. For example, if the relevant patent is owned by a competitor, that competitor may choose not to license patent rights to us. If we decide to develop alternative technology, we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products.\nIt is possible that we may in the future receive, particularly as a public company, communications from competitors and other companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, offering licenses to such intellectual property or threatening litigation. In addition to patent infringement claims, third parties may assert copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights against us. We may need to expend considerable resources to counter such claims and may not be able to be successful in our defense. Our business may suffer if a finding of infringement is established.\nGeneric competitors can challenge the U.S. patents protecting our product candidates by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or an NDA for a generic or a modified version of our product candidates and negatively affect our competitive position.\nSeparate and apart from the protection provided under the U.S. patent laws, drug candidates may be subject to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which may provide drug candidates with either a three- or five-year period of marketing exclusivity following receipt of FDA approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the FDA from accepting the filing of an ANDA application (for a generic product) or a 505(b)(2) NDA (for a modified version of the product) for three years for active drug ingredients previously approved by the FDA or for five years for active drug ingredients not previously approved by the FDA.\nThere is an exception, however, for newly approved molecules that allows competitors to challenge a patent beginning four years into the five-year exclusivity period by alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the FDA\u2019s list of approved drug products are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed and submitting an ANDA for a generic version of a drug candidate. This patent challenge is commonly known as a Paragraph IV certification. Within the past several years, the generic industry has aggressively pursued approvals of generic versions of innovator drugs at the earliest possible point in time.\nIf a generic company is able to successfully challenge the patents covering drug candidates by obtaining FDA approval for an ANDA, the generic company may choose to launch a generic version of a drug candidate. Any launch of a generic version of our drug candidates prior to the expiration of patent protection will have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations.\nWe and our commercial partners are currently involved in Paragraph IV litigations in the United States involving our patents in respect of Zohydro ER\u00ae. These litigations may be expensive, distracting to management and protracted and could result in new or additional generic competition to Zohydro ER\u00ae. The introduction of a generic version of Zohydro ER\u00ae could cause a reduction in product revenue for our manufacturing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in an interference in front of the United States Patent and Trademark Office with another party, which involves a patent application relating to Zohydro ER\u00ae. We intend to vigorously prosecute our application that is involved in this interference. The interference could result in the issuance of a patent that could limit our freedom to operate in respect to Zohydro ER\u00ae, which could also cause a reduction in product revenue for our manufacturing business and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged in the United States to date. The pharmaceutical patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently or may in the future own or license from third parties. Further, if any patent license we obtain is deemed invalid and/or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or partner our technology.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nwe were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nan individual or party will not challenge inventorship, that if successful, could have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may possess, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn the future, we may rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications.\nWe have systems in place to remind us to pay periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other patent and application fees, and we employ an outside law firm to pay these fees. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ an outside law firm and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have not registered our Recro trademark in the United States or the other potential markets for our products. It is possible that when we do file for such registrations one or more of the applications could be subject to opposition or cancellation after the marks are registered. The registrations, if they become effective, will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. It is also possible that there are names or symbols other than \u201cRecro Pharma\u201d and \u201cRecro Gainesville\u201d that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our future trademark registrations and the trademarks may not survive such proceedings.\nOur ability to manufacture products for our commercial partners may be impaired if any of our manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, are found to infringe patents of others.\nOur ability to continue to manufacture Ritalin LA\u00ae, Focalin XR\u00ae, Verelan PM\u00ae, generic Verapamil and Zohydro ER\u00ae for our commercial partners, to utilize third parties to supply raw materials or other products, or to perform fill/finish services or other steps in our manufacture and supply chain, depends on our and their ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of others. Other parties may allege that our manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacturing and supply chain, infringe patents or other intellectual property rights. A judicial decision in favor of one or more parties making such allegations could preclude the manufacture of the products to which those intellectual property rights apply, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports, or if they publish unfavorable research or reports, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If additional securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any return on an investment in our common stock will be realized, if at all, only when shareholders sell their shares. In addition, our failure to pay dividends may make our stock less attractive to investors, adversely impacting trading volume and price.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with our directors and their affiliated entities and our executive officers will limit shareholders\u2019 abilities to influence certain corporate matters.\nOur directors and their affiliated entities, and our executive officers beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 45.9% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2015. As a result, these shareholders are collectively able to influence matters\nrequiring approval of our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Such influence may delay, prevent or deter a change in control of our company, even when such a change may be in the best interests of some shareholders, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock or cause it to continue to be highly volatile or subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include, among other things:\n\u2022\nFDA, state or international regulatory actions, including actions on regulatory applications for any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022\njudicial pronouncements interpreting laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nlitigation or public concern about the safety of our product candidates or similar product candidates;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders; and\n\u2022\nactions by institutional shareholders.\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including recently. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are and we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, until the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (4) the date on which we are deemed a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to:\n\u2022\nhave an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u2022\nsubmit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder non-binding advisory votes;\n\u2022\nsubmit for shareholder approval golden parachute payments not previously approved; and\n\u2022\ndisclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and financial performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation to median employee compensation, when such disclosure requirements are adopted.\nIn addition, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on some of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Any sales of shares by these shareholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe sale of our common stock to Aspire Capital may cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Aspire Capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOn February 2, 2015, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital, in which Aspire Capital is committed to purchase, at our election, up to an aggregate of $10.0 million shares of our common stock over the 24-month term of the Agreement.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, we sold 93,940 shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement for $560,000. We may ultimately sell all, some or none of the remaining $9.4 million of common stock to Aspire Capital, and Aspire Capital may sell all, some or none of our shares that it holds or comes to hold under the Purchase Agreement. Sales by Aspire Capital of shares acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement may result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by Aspire Capital, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of sales of our shares to Aspire Capital, and the Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any penalty or cost to us.", "PERMNO": 14550, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "REPH"}
