{"cik": "868278", "company": "ProPhase Labs, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to causing, actual results to differ from our expectations in material ways. In evaluating our business, investors should pay particular attention to the risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this Annual Report and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The trading price of our common stock could also decline due to any of these risks. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nOur current business and assets are limited.\nWe sold substantially all of our assets and related intellectual property assets in connection with the sale of our Cold-EEZE\u00ae Business to Mylan. Our remaining assets consist primarily of the net proceeds from the transaction, our PMI manufacturing business, our Company headquarters, and our TK Supplements\u00ae brand product lines and operations. This increases our business risk because we are less diversified than before the sale of our Cold-EEZE\u00ae Business to Mylan, and because our remaining business is very limited. We continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities for other companies, technologies and products within and outside the consumer products industry, but we have no current plans to do any such acquisitions at this time.\nWe have a history of losses.\nWe have experienced net losses from continuing operations before income tax for two of the last three fiscal years. As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of approximately $27.8 million, which we believe is an acceptable and adequate level of working capital to support our business for at least the next twelve months ending March 2019. As a consequence of our enhanced liquidity following the sale of our Cold-EEZE\u00ae Business, we are actively exploring new product technologies, applications, product line extensions and other new product opportunities and will also consider and pursue other alternatives and strategies, including, but not limited to, investments and acquisitions in other sectors and industries. There can be no assurance that our strategic focus will result in any revenue growth or that we will be successful in initiating or acquiring any new lines of business, or that any such new lines of business will achieve profitability.\nWe have contingent liabilities up to the amount paid by Mylan for our Cold-EEZE\u00ae Business, which could adversely affect our ability to pursue our business goals and objectives.\nWe made customary representations and warranties to Mylan in the asset purchase agreement to purchase the Cold-EEZE\u00ae Business. Pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement, we agreed to indemnify Mylan for any losses caused by breaches of most of our representations, warranties or covenants that occur, in most cases, within 24 months after the closing date of the sale to Mylan. A breach by us of certain fundamental representations would expose us to indemnification payments to Mylan up to the purchase price. The payment of any such indemnification obligations would adversely impact our cash resources and could affect our ability to pursue our business goals and objectives. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our remaining operations, we may need to seek to raise equity or debt financing or sell additional assets, which may not be possible under satisfactory terms, if at all.\nOur business is subject to significant competitive pressures.\nWe compete with other contract manufacturers of OTC drug and dietary supplement products. These suppliers range widely in size. We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality and service. Management believes that our manufacturing capacity and abilities, offer a significant advantage over many of our competitors in the full service contract development and manufacturing industry. We have over 20 years of manufacturing experience and industry know how in large scale batch production of OTC lozenge products. To the extent that any of our competitors is able to offer better prices, quality and/or services, we could lose customers and our sales and margins may decline. In addition, the loss of any major customer, a significant reduction in the purchasing levels of any major customer or a significant adverse change in the terms of our supply agreement with any major customer could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe OTC healthcare products and dietary supplements industries are highly competitive. Many of the participants in these industries have substantially greater capital resources, technical staffs, facilities, marketing resources, product development, and distribution experience than we do. We believe that our ability to compete in these industries will depend on a number of factors, including product quality and price, availability, speed to market, consumer marketing, reliability, credit terms, brand name recognition, delivery time and post-sale service and support. However, our failure to appropriately and timely respond to consumer preferences and demand for new products could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, unfavorable publicly or consumer perception of products we develop and commercialize could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. If we are unable to compete effectively, our earnings may be significantly negatively impacted.\nThe customers for whom we contract manufacture may significantly influence our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenues from continuing operations have come principally from our PMI contract manufacturing services. Our contract manufacturing business is dependent on demand for the products we manufacture for our customers and we have no control or influence over the market demand for those products. Demand for our customers\u2019 products can be adversely affected by, among other things, regulatory issues, the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection, the emergence of competing products, competition from other contract manufacturers, negative public or consumer perception of those products or our industry and changes in the marketing strategies for such products. If production volumes of products that we manufacture for third-parties and related revenues are not maintained or if there is any change in the terms or a termination of our manufacturing agreement with Mylan, it may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions at our PMI manufacturing facilities or any loss of manufacturing certifications could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and customer relationships.\nAny significant disruption at our manufacturing facility for any reason, including regulatory requirements, an FDA determination that the facility is not in compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations, the loss of certifications, power interruptions, destruction or damage to the facility could disrupt our ability to manufacture products for our contract manufacturing customers and any of our own branded products. Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur PMI manufacturing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and may fluctuate from cold season to cold season.\nThe sales at our PMI manufacturing facility are subject to seasonal fluctuations and influenced by the timing, length and severity of each cold season. Our revenues tend to be higher in the first, third and fourth quarters during the cold season. Generally, a cold season is defined as the period of September to March, when the incidence of the common cold rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors.\nOur product development and commercialization efforts may be unsuccessful.\nThere are numerous risks associated with OTC product development and commercialization. We may be subject to delays and/or be unable to successfully implement our business plan and strategy to develop and commercialize one or more OTC products and/or dietary supplements. The successful commercialization and market acceptance of any products we develop will be subject to, among other things, consumer purchasing trends, health and wellness trends, regulatory factors, retail acceptance and overall economic and market conditions. As a consequence, we may suspend or abandon some or all of our proposed new products before they ever become commercially viable. Even if we successfully develop and obtain approval of a new product, if we cannot successfully commercialize it in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could impact our business.\nWe will rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights in any products we develop and commercialize. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property will be difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, may result in counterclaims or other claims against us and could significantly harm our results of operations. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. From time to time, we may apply to have certain trademarks registered. There is no guarantee that such trademark registrations will be granted. The unauthorized reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may require additional capital to support our product development and commercialization programs.\nWe may require additional capital to support our product development and commercialization programs. The amount of capital that may be needed to support our product development initiatives will depend on many factors which may include, but are not limited to (i) the cost involved in applying for and obtaining FDA, international regulatory or other technical approvals, if required, (ii) whether we elect to establish partnering or other strategic arrangements for the development, sales, manufacturing and marketing of such products, and (iii) the revenue we generate from our manufacturing services, our TK Supplements\u00ae product line and the expenses incurred in marketing our manufacturing capabilities.\nIncome from our PMI manufacturing business and TK Supplements\u00ae products may not generate all the funds we need to support future product development and commercialization. We may need to access our 2015 equity line with Dutchess Opportunity Fund II, LP (\u201cDutchess\u201d) to finance our growth. Our equity line is limited, and expires in July 2018, however, and may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. Furthermore, any shares we sell to Dutchess under the equity line will have a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of existing stockholders.\nTo the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations and/or funding from our equity line with Dutchess, we may, in the short and long-term, seek to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities or through other financing sources. To the extent that we seek to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may include financial and other covenants that could restrict our use of the proceeds from such financing or impose other business and financial restrictions on us. In addition, we may consider alternative approaches such as licensing, joint venture, or partnership arrangements to provide long term capital. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAdverse credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact the availability and cost of credit to us in the future. Accordingly, we may be forced to delay raising capital or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures or other discretionary uses of cash. Overall, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets.\nGeneral economic and other conditions that impact consumer spending could adversely affect the Company.\nAdverse economic conditions, including high unemployment, declines in the stock market and the instability of the credit markets, could cause a reduction in consumer spending. While there has been a trend toward lower unemployment in recent periods, which has contributed to a better economic climate, there is uncertainty about the continued strength of the economy. If the economy weakens, consumers may reduce consumer spending.\nIncreases in the price or shortages of supply of key raw materials could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur TK Supplements\u00ae products and the products we manufacture for third parties are composed of certain key raw materials. If the prices of these raw materials were to increase significantly, it could result in a significant increase to us in the prices charged to us for our own branded products and third-party products. Raw material prices may increase in the future and we may not be able to pass on those increases to customers who purchase our products or to the customers whose products we manufacture. A significant increase in the price of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are reliant upon the supply of raw materials that meet our specifications and the specifications of third parties for whom we manufacture. If any raw material is adulterated and does not meet our specifications or third parties\u2019 specifications, it could significantly impact our ability to manufacture products and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we are no longer able to obtain products from one or more of our suppliers on terms reasonable to us or at all, our ability to perform under contracts with third parties for whom we manufacture products and our customer relationships could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental regulation.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that cover:\n\u25cf the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products;\n\u25cf the health and safety of our products;\n\u25cf trade practice and direct selling laws; and\n\u25cf product claims and advertising.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is time consuming and expensive. Moreover, new regulations could be adopted that would severely restrict the products we sell or manufacture or our ability to continue our business. We are unable to predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. These future changes could, however, require the reformulation or elimination of certain products; imposition of additional record keeping and documentation requirements; imposition of new federal reporting and application requirements; modified methods of importing, manufacturing, storing or distributing certain products; and expanded or different labeling and substantiation requirements for certain products and ingredients. Any or all of these requirements could harm our business.\nIn July 2011, the FDA issued draft guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients (\u201cNDIs\u201d) and in August 2016, the FDA issued revised draft guidance. We believe that the draft guidance, if implemented as proposed, could have a material impact on our operations. FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written could require us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively affect our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, the detention and refusal of admission of imported products, the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that those ingredients or products are in compliance, and the potential imposition of penalties for non-compliance.\nOur failure to comply with FTC regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties and could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against OTC drug companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. Failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our products do not have the effects intended or cause undesirable side effects, our business may suffer.\nAlthough many of the ingredients in our current dietary supplement products are vitamins, minerals, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption, they also contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. While we believe that all of these products and the combinations of ingredients in them are safe when taken as directed, the products could have certain undesirable side effects if not taken as directed or if taken by a consumer who has certain medical conditions. In addition, these products may not have the effect intended if they are not taken in accordance with certain instructions, which include certain dietary restrictions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any of the products, even when used as directed, will have the effects intended or will not have harmful side effects in an unforeseen way or on an unforeseen cohort. If any of our products or products we develop or commercialize in the future are shown to be harmful or generate negative publicity from perceived harmful effects, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed significantly.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nAs a direct marketer and manufacturer of products designed for human consumption, we are subject to product liability claims if the use of our products or the products that we manufacture for third parties are alleged to have resulted in injury or to include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances. Our current products and the products that we currently manufacture for third parties are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. Our products or the products we manufacture for third parties could contain contaminated substances.\nWhile we currently maintain product liability insurance, a successful claim brought against us related to our branded products or products that we manufacture for third parties in excess of, or outside of, our existing insurance coverage, could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation with customers, which could in turn materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continued service of key personnel, such as Mr. Ted Karkus, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain managers and strategists within the Company. The loss of the services of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn order to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, marketing and health product positions. In particular, our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified health and science professionals. Competition for skilled employees who can perform the services that we require is intense and hiring, training, motivating, retaining and managing employees with the skills required is time-consuming and expensive. If we are not able to hire sufficient professional staff to support our operations, or to train, motivate, retain and manage the employees we do hire, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cSection 382\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (the \u201cNOLs\u201d), to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations.\nBased upon estimates, we believe that a significant portion of our income tax liability of $18.8 million arising from our taxable gain for federal and state income tax purposes from the sale of the Cold-EEZE\u00ae Business will be offset to the extent of our current year losses from operations, the write-off for tax purposes of the tax-basis of the Cold-EEZE\u00ae Business and the available net operating loss carryforwards at the federal and state levels.\nBased on our Section 382 analysis, we do not believe our current net operating loss carryforwards are subject to these limitations as of December 31, 2017. Should we identify any limitations upon the completion of our final 2017 income tax return, the impact could be material to our consolidated financial statements and that we could incur additional income tax expense arising from the sale of the Cold-EEZE\u00ae Business.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has experienced significant volatility. There are several factors that could impact the price of our Common Stock, including announcements of technological innovations for new commercial products by us or our competitors, developments concerning propriety rights, new or revised governmental regulation, litigation or general conditions in the market for our products or those we manufacture for others.\nFuture sales of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our Common Stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales are likely to occur, could affect prevailing trading prices of our Common Stock.\nIf a significant number of our outstanding stock options are exercised, and the holders of these options attempt to sell a substantial amount of their holdings all at once, the market price of our Common Stock would likely decline. Moreover, the perceived risk of this potential dilution could cause stockholders to attempt to sell their shares and investors to \u201cshort\u201d our stock, a practice in which an investor sells shares that he or she does not own at prevailing market prices, hoping to purchase shares later at a lower price to cover the sale. As each of these events would cause the number of shares of Common Stock being offered for sale to increase, our Common Stock\u2019s market price would likely further decline. All of these events could combine to make it very difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, products or stock performance, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, the unpredictability of our financial results likely reduces the certainty, and therefore reliability, of the forecasts by securities or industry analysts of our future financial results, adding to the potential volatility of our stock price.\nOur Chief Executive Officer owns a substantial amount of our Common Stock.\nAs of March 28, 2018, our Chief Executive Officer beneficially owned approximately 24.0% of our Common Stock. As such, our Chief Executive Officer may exert significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. Consequently, he exercises substantial influence over major decisions including major corporate actions such as mergers and other business combinations transactions which could result in or prevent a change of control of the Company. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of our Chief Executive Officer could be in conflict with the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, a stockholder\u2019s ability to influence us through voting their shares may be limited.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our Common Stock since our inception. Our intention is to retain earnings, if any, for use in the business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions that may be barriers to a takeover.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions which may deter, discourage, or make it difficult for another person or entity to gain control of the Company through a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or similar transaction or series of transactions. These provisions may deter a future tender offer or other takeover attempt which could include a premium over the market price of our Common Stock at the time. Such provisions could depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our Officers and Directors from liability.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any person who is or was made a party to, or is or was threatened to be made a party to, any pending, completed, or threatened action, suit or proceeding because he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the Company\u2019s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. These provisions permit us to advance expenses to an indemnified party in connection with defending any such proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by the indemnified party to repay those amounts if it is later determined that the party is not entitled to indemnification. We entered into indemnity agreements with each member of our board of directors. These agreements provide, among other things, that we will indemnify each officer and director in the event they become a party or otherwise a participant in any action or proceeding on account of their service as a director or officer of the Company (or service for another corporation or entity in any capacity at the request of the Company) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The indemnification provisions may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers and discourage or deter stockholders from suing directors or officers for breaches of their duties to the Company, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company or its stockholders. In addition, to the extent that we expend funds to indemnify directors and officers, funds will be unavailable for operational purposes.\nA number of companies are seeking to make acquisitions in our industry, which may make our acquisition strategy more difficult or expensive to pursue.\nThe emergence and growth of OTC consumer healthcare products, dietary supplements and related products has brought increased media attention, and a number of companies and investors have begun making acquisitions of businesses or announced their intention to do so. We compete with many of these companies, and certain of them have greater financial resources than we do for pursuing and consummating acquisitions and to developing and integrating acquired businesses. Any acquisitions we undertake may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our Company, which may result in the diversion of our capital and our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, technology, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures. We cannot provide assurance that any acquisition we make will be successful and our operating results may be adversely impacted by the integration of a new business and its financial results.\nWe may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates which may negatively impact our competitive position and our growth strategy.\nWe may be unable to identify suitable targets for future acquisition or acquire businesses at favorable prices, which would negatively impact our growth strategy. In addition, in the course of negotiating potential acquisitions, we may enter into term sheets, letters of intent, purchase options or other similar agreements that provide the counterparties with advances and termination or break-up fees in the event that we do not ultimately consummate any such acquisition. In the aggregate, the payment of any such termination or break-up fees may negatively impact our financial condition. We may not be able to execute our growth strategy through organic expansion, and if we are unable to identify and successfully acquire new businesses or products complementary to ours, we may not be able to expand or achieve profitability.", "PERMNO": 85205, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRPH"}
