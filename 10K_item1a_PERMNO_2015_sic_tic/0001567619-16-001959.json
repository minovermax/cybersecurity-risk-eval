RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves risks, including (among others) the following factors:\nGeneral political, economic or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be less favorable than expected.\nLocal, domestic, and international economic, political and industry-specific conditions affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as or related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts and other factors outside of our control, such as real estate values, energy costs, fuel prices, state and local municipal budget deficits, and government spending and the U.S. national debt, may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect us. As has been the case with the impact of recent economic conditions, economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans, which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings.\nGovernmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry, and therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S., and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments. Changes in such policies, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the value of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies.\nVolatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal capital and credit markets are sometimes subject to periods of extreme volatility and disruption. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit our ability to access capital and manage liquidity, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led, and may further lead, to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect us and possibly be material in nature.\nChanges in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Michigan DIFS, the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which we may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, investigations and limitations related to our securities, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)\nIn particular, Congress and other regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry in recent years. The effects on us of recent legislation and regulatory actions cannot reliably be fully determined at this time. Moreover, as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire, the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown. Any delay in the economic recovery or a worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect us. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on our businesses or operations cannot be determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect us.\nWe have credit risk inherent in our loan portfolios, and our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to their respective terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to cover any losses we may incur. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. Non-performing loans amounted to $10.7 million and $15.2 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Our allowance coverage ratio of non-performing loans was 210.5% and 170.6% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. In determining the size of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our experience and our evaluation of current economic conditions. If our assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, our current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover certain loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio, and adjustments may be necessary to account for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to our allowance would adversely impact our operating results.\nAlthough we perform periodic internal testing of our loan portfolio to help ensure the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, if the assumptions or judgments used in these analyses prove to be incorrect, our current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Material additions to our allowance would adversely impact our operating results. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize additional loan charge-offs, notwithstanding any internal analysis that has been performed. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have credit risk in our securities portfolio.\nWe maintain diversified securities portfolios, which include obligations of the Treasury and government-sponsored agencies as well as securities issued by states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, corporate securities and asset-backed securities. We seek to limit credit losses in our securities portfolios by generally purchasing only highly rated securities (rated \"AA\" or higher by a major debt rating agency) and by conducting due diligence on the issuer. However, gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale in our portfolio totaled approximately $3.5 million as of December 31, 2015 (compared to approximately $3.1 million as of December 31, 2014). We believe these unrealized losses are temporary in nature and are expected to be recovered within a reasonable time period as we believe we have the ability to hold the securities to maturity or until such time as the unrealized losses reverse. However, we evaluate securities available for sale for other than temporary impairment (OTTI) at least quarterly and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Those evaluations may result in OTTI charges to our earnings. In addition to these impairment charges, we may, in the future, experience additional losses in our securities portfolio which may result in charges that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe assumptions we make in calculating estimated potential losses on vehicle service contract counterparty receivables for Mepco may be inaccurate, which could lead to vehicle service contract counterparty contingencies expense that is materially greater than the charges we have taken to date.\nOne of our subsidiaries, Mepco, is engaged in the business of acquiring and servicing payment plans for consumers who purchase vehicle service contracts and similar products. The receivables generated in this business involve a different, and generally higher, level of risk of delinquency or collection than generally associated with the loan portfolios of our bank. Upon cancellation of the payment plans acquired by Mepco (whether due to voluntary cancellation by the consumer or non-payment), the third party entities that provide the service contracts or other products to consumers (which we refer to as Mepco's \"counterparties\") become obligated to refund Mepco the unearned portion of the sales price previously funded by Mepco. These obligations of Mepco's counterparties are shown as \"vehicle service contract counterparty receivables\" in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of such obligations owing to Mepco by counterparties, net of write-downs and reserves made through the recognition of \"vehicle service contract counterparty contingencies expense,\" totaled $7.2 million. This compares to a balance of $7.2 million and $7.7 million at December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)\nIn most cases, there is no collateral to secure the counterparties\u2019 refund obligations to Mepco, but Mepco has the contractual right to offset unpaid refund obligations against amounts Mepco would otherwise be obligated to fund to the counterparties. In addition, even when other collateral is involved, the refund obligations of these counterparties are not fully secured. Mepco incurs losses when it is unable to fully recover funds owing to it by counterparties upon cancellation of the underlying service contracts.\nPrior to 2009, Mepco's counterparties generally fulfilled their obligations to Mepco to refund Mepco the amounts owed upon cancellation of the service contracts. However, events in the vehicle service contract industry starting in approximately 2009 significantly increased the size of these counterparty obligations. These events, which included allegations that several service contract providers violated telemarketing and other consumer protection laws, contributed to significantly higher cancellation rates for outstanding service contracts and significantly lower sales of new service contract products which, in turn, contributed to several of Mepco's counterparties either going out of business or defaulting on their obligations to Mepco. Although Mepco generally has recourse against more than one counterparty upon the cancellation of a service contract, Mepco did not historically have to enforce its rights against one counterparty (e.g., the administrator of a particular service contract that cancelled) based upon the default of a second counterparty (e.g., the seller of the service contract). As Mepco has worked to enforce these rights in recent years, certain of its counterparties challenged their payment obligations to Mepco. Mepco is currently involved in litigation with certain of its counterparties to enforce Mepco's rights to collect refunds owing from those counterparties. We may need to initiate additional lawsuits against other counterparties that do not pay their obligations to Mepco.\nIn evaluating the collectability of these receivables, Mepco estimates probable incurred losses that Mepco expects to incur as a result of being unable to fully collect all amounts owing to Mepco. The aggregate amount of these probable incurred losses (shown as \"vehicle service contract counterparty contingencies expense\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations) was $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $4.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe determination of these losses requires a significant amount of judgment because a number of factors can influence the amount of loss that we may ultimately incur. These factors include our estimate of future cancellations of vehicle service contracts (including cancellations that may result from a counterparty discontinuing its business operations), our evaluation of collateral that may be available to recover funds due from our counterparties, and the amount collected from counterparties in connection with their contractual obligations. We apply a rigorous process, based upon observable contract activity and past experience, to estimate probable incurred losses for our vehicle service contract counterparty contingencies, but there can be no assurance that our modeling process will successfully identify all such losses. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the numerous and complex assumptions made, actual losses could exceed the charges we have taken to date, and the additional losses we incur could be material.\nEven though the size of Mepco's business has been significantly reduced in recent years, it still presents unique market, operational, and internal control challenges and risks.\nMepco faces unique operational and internal control challenges due to the relatively rapid turnover of its portfolio and high volume of new payment plans. Mepco's business is highly specialized, and its results of operation depend largely on the continued services of its executives and other key employees familiar with its business. In addition, because activity in this market is conducted primarily through relationships with unaffiliated vehicle service contract direct marketers and administrators and because the customers are located nationwide, risk management and general supervisory oversight are generally more difficult than in our bank. The risk of third party fraud is also higher as a result of these factors. Acts of fraud are difficult to detect and deter, and we cannot assure investors that the risk management procedures and controls will prevent losses from fraudulent activity. Although we have an internal control system at Mepco, we may be exposed to the risk of material loss in this business. As of December 31, 2015, Mepco had total assets of $57.2 million, which amounts to 2.4 percent of our consolidated assets.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)\nOur mortgage-banking revenues are susceptible to substantial variations, due in part to factors we do not control, such as market interest rates.\nA portion of our revenues are derived from gains on mortgage loans. These net gains primarily depend on the volume of loans we sell, which in turn depends on our ability to originate real estate mortgage loans and the demand for fixed-rate obligations and other loans that are outside of our established interest-rate risk parameters. Net gains on mortgage loans are also dependent upon economic and competitive factors as well as our ability to effectively manage exposure to changes in interest rates. Consequently, they can often be a volatile part of our overall revenues. We realized net gains of $7.4 million on mortgage loans during 2015 compared to $5.6 million during 2014 and $10.0 million during 2013.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely impact our ability to fund various obligations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur parent company must rely on dividends or returns of capital from our bank for most of its cash flow.\nOur parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank. Generally, our parent company receives substantially all of its cash flow from dividends or returns of capital from our subsidiary bank. These dividends or returns of capital are the principal source of funds to pay our parent company\u2019s operating expenses and for cash dividends on our common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to the parent company. For example, at the present time, because our bank has negative retained earnings, it is not permitted to pay any dividends to our parent company. Therefore, we have made requests for returns of capital from the bank to our parent company. A return of capital request requires approval by our state bank regulators. While we have received approval for the four requests made to date, there is no assurance that we will obtain any further approval in the future. In the event our bank cannot obtain approval for a return of capital or is unable to pay future dividends to our parent company, we may not be able to pay future cash dividends on our common stock.\nAny future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to our business and operations.\nDifficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent us from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition, or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected. Further, the assimilation of the acquired entity's customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption of our businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. These matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period. We will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change our business mix.\nCompliance with new capital requirements may adversely affect us.\nThe capital requirements applicable to us as a bank holding company as well as to our subsidiary bank have been substantially revised in connection with Basel III and the requirements of the Financial Reform Act. These more stringent capital requirements, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends in the future, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and/or existing shareholders. The ultimate impact of the new capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including treatment and implementation by the U.S. bank regulators. However, maintaining higher levels of capital may reduce our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)\nDeclines in the businesses or industries of our customers could cause increased credit losses, which could adversely affect us.\nOur business customer base consists, in part, of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive production industry and the real estate business. These industries are sensitive to global economic conditions and supply chain factors. Any decline in one of those customers' businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses, which in turn could adversely affect us.\nThe introduction, implementation, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe make certain projections and develop plans and strategies for our banking and financial products. If we do not accurately determine demand for or changes in our banking and financial product needs, it could result in us incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market, and deliver new products and services to our customers.\nThe financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands, meet regulatory requirements, and create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to our customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational difficulties, failure of technology infrastructure or information security incidents could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, failure of our controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Given the high volume of transactions we process, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved. In particular, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our technology systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to our dependency on third party vendors for components of our business infrastructure, including our core data processing systems which are largely outsourced. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their operations. As such, any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, cyber attacks, spikes in transaction volume and/or customer activity, electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters. Although we have programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems, business applications and customer information, such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to us.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)\nThe occurrence of any failure or interruption in our operations or information systems, or any security breach, could cause reputational damage, jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory intervention or expose us to civil litigation and financial loss or liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in the financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing, could adversely affect our net interest income and financial condition.\nThe operations of financial institutions such as us are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions, the trade, fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which in turn significantly affect financial institutions' net interest income. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions. Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions.\nCompetitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within our markets may change.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing. If we are unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in our markets, business could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in customer behavior may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use a variety of methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of our strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of our control, such as fuel prices, energy costs, real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect our ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements.\nFurther, difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels. A decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us, our customers and others in the financial institutions industry.\nOur ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations.\nThe financial services industry is very competitive. We not only vie for business opportunities with new customers, but also compete to maintain and expand the relationships we have with our existing customers. While we believe that we can continue to grow many of these relationships, we will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as our competitors attempt to capture our customers. Failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact our earnings.\nOur ability to retain key officers and employees may change.\nOur future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our executive officers and key personnel. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)\nFurther, our ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any key employees, or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry, including those directly involving us, could adversely affect us or the financial services industry in general.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of our efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by our regulators that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMethods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective.\nInstruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market and liquidity, operational, compliance, business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTerrorist activities or other hostilities may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and us.\nTerrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt our operations or those of our customers. In addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economies in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm our operations. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers. This could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nCatastrophic events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires and floods, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and us.\nWe have significant operations and a significant customer base in Michigan where natural and other disasters may occur, such as tornadoes and floods. These types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy, our business, and our customers and have posed physical risks to our property. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on our customers and in turn, on us. A significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, changes are made to the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings.\nOur failure to appropriately apply certain critical accounting policies could result in our misstatement of our financial results and condition.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. We must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with U.S. GAAP. In some cases, we must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)\nWe have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding management's judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements. See note #1, \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our annual report, to be delivered to shareholders in connection with the April 26, 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (filed as exhibit 13 to this report on Form 10-K).\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to, among other things:\n\u00b7 variations in quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u00b7 changes in dividends per share;\n\u00b7 deterioration in asset quality, including declining real estate values;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates;\n\u00b7 significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 regulatory actions, including changes to regulatory capital levels, the components of regulatory capital and how regulatory capital is calculated;\n\u00b7 new regulations that limit or significantly change our ability to continue to offer products or services;\n\u00b7 volatility of stock market prices and volumes;\n\u00b7 issuance of additional shares of common stock or other debt or equity securities;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 changes in securities analysts' estimates of financial performance or recommendations;\n\u00b7 perceptions in the marketplace regarding the financial services industry, us and/or our competitors; and/or\n\u00b7 the occurrence of any one or more of the risk factors described above.", "PERMNO": 88912, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "IBCP"}
