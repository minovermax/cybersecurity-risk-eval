{"cik": "1192448", "company": "GLAUKOS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe reduced reimbursement rates established by CMS for 2022 have, and may continue to, materially and adversely impact our business operations and financial results.\nAs described in Item 1, Business, \u201cRecent Developments - 2022 reimbursement rates,\u201d the United States (U.S.) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS\u2019) Final Rules for 2022 impose a new, significantly lower physician fee and a slightly reduced facility fee related to the implantation of trabecular bypass stents, such as our iStent family of products, in conjunction with cataract surgery, furnished in the ambulatory surgery center setting. We believe these CMS physician fee and facility fee rate decreases disrupted traditional customer ordering patterns and have resulted in our customers\u2019 trialing of competitive products, causing reduced glaucoma sales volumes in the U.S. during our third and fourth quarter of 2021. The reduction of the physician fee may continue to have an adverse impact on procedural iStent family product volumes, in conjunction with cataract surgery, in 2022, as well as on our U.S. combo-cataract glaucoma revenues, gross profit, and net income, the full extent of which is not known at this time.\nAdditionally, the Final Rules established facility fee payment rates for the procedure that hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers will use with Glaukos\u2019 iStent infinite product, which is not yet approved by the FDA, that were lower than anticipated. The physician fee payment rate for this procedure will be set by the multi-state, regional contractors, or Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), responsible for administering Medicare claims, and is unknown at this time. This physician fee payment rate, alone or in combination with the standalone facility fee payment rate, may result in inadequate reimbursement and impact the use of this product, if and when approved.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to materially and adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nWhile COVID-19 and its resulting variant viruses have had, and we expect them to continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nTo protect our employees and adhere to the guidance and orders of various governmental authorities, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through December 31, 2021, we shifted the majority of our workforce to remote operations and implemented changes to our manufacturing and distribution operations to include the use of personal protective equipment and ensure social distancing. Further, in an effort to identify, and avoid further infection from, asymptomatic cases, we have required that any onsite individuals adhere to our social distancing and masking requirements. As our employees begin to return to onsite work, a process that began in January 2022, the return-to-work strategies we have adopted or may adopt, including masking, testing, vaccination or other requirements, may have an unanticipated impact on our employees that could be disruptive to our business and adversely impact our financial and operational results.\nAdditionally, we have experienced a number of COVID-19 cases among our workforce, and we could experience a wider-spread outbreak of COVID-19 in our manufacturing facilities, which could require us to temporarily shut down manufacturing operations and/or cause a disruption to, or shortage in, our workforce. If a widespread outbreak were to occur, we may experience delays in our responses to our customers and possible delays in shipments of our products, which could harm our customer relations and adversely impact our competitive positioning and sales. We have also experienced restrictions on the ability of our personnel to travel and access customers and clinical sites for training and support. Other potential disruptions include delays in approvals by regulatory bodies; delays in product development efforts; and further challenges to our capacity to manufacture, sell and support the use of our products.\nWe continue to carefully manage our discretionary spending in response to COVID, which may slow the growth trajectory of the Company or require us to delay projects that could have benefitted the Company. In addition to the cost saving measures, we issued $287.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% convertible notes due 2027 (the Convertible Notes) in June 2020, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As described in Item 1, Business, \u201cImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Current Economic Environment,\u201d some of our supply chain and development partners have experienced delays and unfulfilled deliveries of product due to COVID, both in raw material acquisition and due to lack of headcount resources. If these delays and partial or unfilled deliveries persist, they could impact our ability to ship some of our products to our customers, or bring some of our pipeline products to market, in a timely manner.\nWe cannot predict the timing and full impact of the pandemic on our future financial and operating results given the continued uncertainties associated with the pandemic, including the possibility of future surges of COVID-19, uncertainties about the severity and transmission rates of new more contagious and/or vaccine-resistant variants of COVID-19, the availability, distribution, public acceptance rate and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19 and patient reluctance to seek primary care from optometrists and ophthalmologists or undergo medical procedures during or following the pandemic. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread staffing shortages, including in ambulatory surgery centers, which may also impact elective procedures. Restrictions on elective procedures and therapies and the closures of ophthalmic practices in an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19 have also impacted the progress of our pipeline products. For example, new patient enrollment in our iDose clinical trial slowed significantly but was completed in June 2021, which delayed the iDose approval timeline. Any further prolonged economic slowdown or reinstitution of stay-at-home or similar orders may cause additional delays in the progress of our pipeline products, including those in clinical trials. While we cannot predict the full impact of COVID-19 on the timing of completion of our clinical trials and the expected regulatory approvals of our pipeline products, our disclosed targeted approval dates anticipate, to our best estimate, such impact.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and our business requires substantial capital and operating expenditures to operate and grow. There can be no guarantee that we reach sustained profitability.\nSince the Company\u2019s inception in 1998, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $365.2 million, principally from costs incurred in our clinical trial, R&D programs and from our general and administrative expenses. We have funded our operations to date from the sale of equity securities, including our June 2015 initial public offering (IPO), the issuance of notes payable, cash exercises of stock options and warrants to purchase equity securities, cash generated from commercial operations and the issuance of the Convertible Notes. To implement our global business strategies we need to, among other things, fund ongoing R&D activities, expand our manufacturing capabilities, grow our sales and marketing organization, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, acquire companies or in-license products or intellectual property, and obtain regulatory clearance or approval to commercialize our existing products in international markets or to commercialize those currently under development in the U.S. and internationally. As a result, we expect our expenses to continue to increase as we pursue these objectives. While we believe we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 are made publicly available, our ability to reach sustained profitability is highly uncertain, especially given our increasingly competitive landscape, which makes forecasting our sales more difficult.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to generate sales of our commercialized products and develop and commercialize additional products, which we may not be able to accomplish.\nOur primary sales-generating commercial products have been the iStent, which we began selling in the U.S. in 2012, the iStent inject, which we began selling in the U.S. in the second half of 2018, and its successor, the iStent inject W, launched in the second half of 2020, as well as our Photrexa therapies, which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Avedro, Inc. (Avedro) in November 2019. We expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net sales from the iStent, the iStent inject models and the Photrexa therapies.\nIt is important that we continue to build a more complete product offering. Developing additional products is expensive and time-consuming. Even if we are successful in developing our additional pipeline products, including those\ncurrently in development, the success of our new product offerings is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that our products will produce net sales in excess of the costs of development. Any current or new products could also quickly be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying superior technologies, features or better product safety, quality or efficacy. Our competitors include large publicly traded companies or divisions of publicly traded companies and have more resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors, broader products lines, more established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks, and greater experience in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval. Additionally, our research programs, which are expensive and time-intensive, may fail to yield product candidates for clinical development despite showing initial promise. If we are unable to successfully commercialize additional products, our business prospects would be materially affected.\nAs our growth strategy turns increasingly global, we are, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of risks associated with our international operations, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur existing foreign operations, as well as our planned international growth, expose us to additional uncertainty and risks beyond regulatory authorization and reimbursement levels. Internationally, we sell our products through direct sales organizations in seventeen countries and a network of third-party distribution partners in other markets. These international operations expose us and our subsidiaries and third-party distributors to a variety of risks including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf different, and in some cases more exacting and lengthy, regulatory approval processes, regulations and laws, and pricing and reimbursement systems;\n\u25cf reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights or difficulties enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending against third-party threats and intellectual property enforcement actions against us, our distributors, or any of our third-party suppliers;\n\u25cf pricing pressure or longer sales and payment cycles;\n\u25cf different competitive dynamics, including smaller market sizes, which we may not be able to fully appreciate before entering certain foreign markets;\n\u25cf a shortage of high-quality regional sales managers, direct sales representatives and distributors, and the difficulties of managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf relative disadvantages compared to competitors with more recognizable names, longer operating histories and better established distribution networks and customer relationships;\n\u25cf political and economic instability, international terrorism and anti-U.S. sentiment, or the imposition of U.S. or international sanctions that could restrict or prohibit continued business;\n\u25cf changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u25cf scrutiny of foreign tax authorities that could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes;\n\u25cf different cultural norms which may impact how business is conducted;\n\u25cf laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;\n\u25cf difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf money laundering, bribery and corruption practices and breach of sanction regulations by third parties in our distribution network, which may be difficult for us to discover or prevent;\n\u25cf failures by our third-party partners to properly assist us with local guidance on operations, financial and other reporting, accounting, tax, payroll, legal and regulatory matters; and\n\u25cf the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements and restrictions, particularly relating to technology.\nIf we experience any of these risks, our sales in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be harmed, our results of operations would suffer, and our reputation and business prospects would be negatively impacted.\nIf the supply and/or manufacture of our principal revenue-producing products, the iStent, the iStent inject models and our Photrexa therapies, is materially disrupted, it may adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur sole manufacturing location for our iStent products is an approximately 98,000 square foot campus located in San Clemente, California, where we manufacture, inspect, package, release and ship nearly all of our iStent and iStent inject products. This is also the location where we conducted substantially all of our research and development (R&D) activities, customer and technical support, and management and administrative functions in 2021. In January 2022, we began to relocate our corporate administrative headquarters, along with certain laboratory, R&D and warehouse space, to a new facility in Aliso Viejo, California (Aliso Facility), as described in Item 1, Business, \u201cFacilities, Manufacturing and Distribution.\u201d If either of our San Clemente or Aliso Facility suffers a crippling event, or a force majeure event such as an earthquake, fire or flood, this could materially impact our ability to operate.\nAdditionally, we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers, in some cases sole suppliers, to supply components for the iStent, the iStent inject models and our other pipeline products. If any one or more of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of components or drugs in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, we would have to seek alternative sources of supply. Because of factors such as the proprietary nature of our products, our domestic and international quality control standards and regulatory requirements including the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation and Current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations, we may be unable to obtain components if our component suppliers are found to be in violation of such standards and we may have difficulty quickly engaging additional or replacement suppliers for some of our critical components, which could delay or impact our business, including the regulatory approval timelines as has happened with iLink Epioxa. If our manufacturing facilities or those of any of our component suppliers or contract facilities are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations or fail to adequately remediate any issues discovered during an audit, the FDA or other notified bodies could take enforcement action. Even if we are able to identify and qualify a suitable second source to replace one of our key suppliers, if necessary, that replacement supplier would not have access to our previous supplier\u2019s proprietary processes and would therefore be required to develop its own, which could result in further delay. Despite our efforts to maintain an adequate supply of inventory, the loss of these suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of components or products, could cause delay in the manufacture of our products, thereby impairing our ability to meet the demand of our customers and causing significant harm to our business. Any disruption of this nature or increased expense could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur corneal health Photrexa therapies are produced by a small number of contract manufacturing organizations. The systems that bio-activate our Photrexa therapies are primarily manufactured in Burlington, Massachusetts. Any material disruption to the manufacture of our corneal health products, either our pharmaceuticals or their bio-activation systems, could also adversely affect our operating results and clinical efforts.\nIf the quality or delivery of our products does not meet our customers\u2019 expectations, our reputation could suffer and ultimately our sales and operating earnings could be negatively impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we have had to and must continue to adequately address quality issues associated with our products, including in our engineering, design, manufacturing and delivery processes, as well as issues in third-party components included in our products. Because our products are highly complex, the occurrence of performance issues may increase as we continue to introduce new products and as we rapidly scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. In addition, identifying the root cause of performance or quality issues, particularly those affecting third-party components, may be difficult, which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with, for example, shipment holds, product recalls and warranty or other service obligations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers or result in product liability suits against us, which may be expensive to defend or resolve and could impact the reimbursement coverage of our products, our product liability insurance rates and/or our cash reserves in the event our existing insurance coverage is insufficient. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our reputation as a\nproducer of high quality products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOphthalmic surgeons may not use our products if they do not believe they are safe, efficient, effective and preferable alternatives to other treatment solutions in the market or may use our products without being adequately trained, which could result in inferior clinical outcomes.\nWe believe that ophthalmic surgeons will not use our products unless they conclude that our products provide a safe, efficient, effective and preferable alternative to currently available treatment options. If ophthalmic surgeons determine that any of our products are not sufficiently effective, efficient or safe, whether based on longer-term patient studies or clinical experience or unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury, our sales would be harmed. Surgeons may base such determination on patient outcomes that are the result of untrained or unqualified surgeons performing procedures for which they haven\u2019t been trained. It is also possible that as our products become more widely used, latent defects could be identified, creating negative publicity and liability problems for us and adversely affecting demand for our products. If an increasing number of ophthalmic surgeons do not continue to adopt the use of our products, our operating and financial results will be negatively impacted.\nOperating results could be unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our net sales may experience volatility due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among other things, fluctuating demand, pricing pressures applicable to our products, Medicare payment rates established by CMS, commercialization of our new and existing products and the marketing of competitive products, results of clinical research and trials, regulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting our products, variances in the sales terms, supply chain and inventory management, shortage of raw materials, timing or volume of customer orders and the length of our sales cycle, which varies and may be unpredictable. As a result, you should not rely on our results in any past period as an indication of future results and you should anticipate that fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results may continue and could generate volatility in the price of our common stock. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nIf we fail to manage our anticipated growth effectively, we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nSince the commercial launch of the iStent in 2012, we have seen significant period-to-period growth in our business, both organically and through transactions, and we must continue to grow in order to meet our business and financial objectives. However, continued growth may create numerous challenges, including, among others, new and increased responsibilities for our management team; increased competition; increased product demand which could strain our manufacturing capacity; the management of an increasing number of customer, supplier and other relationships; increased pressure on our operating, financial and reporting systems; entry into new international territories with unfamiliar regulations and business approaches; and the need to hire, train and manage additional qualified personnel. If we fail to manage any of these challenges effectively, our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to retain or recruit qualified personnel for growth, our business results could suffer.\nWe have benefited substantially from the leadership and performance of our senior management and other key employees. For example, our chief executive officer, as well as other key members of our senior management, has experience successfully developing novel technologies and scaling early-stage medical device and pharmaceutical companies to achieve profitability. We also rely on our qualified sales representatives and on consultants and advisors in our research, operations, clinical and commercial efforts to grow our business, develop and commercialize new products and implement our business strategies. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management, key employees and consultants and advisors, and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including by providing competitive compensation and benefit programs, career advancement prospects and sufficient opportunities to develop leadership, managerial and other valuable skills. The loss of services of these personnel, which could occur without notice and without cause or good reason, could prevent or delay our growth plans and the implementation and\ncompletion of our strategic objectives, or divert management\u2019s attention to seeking qualified replacements. Our employees, including our senior management, are not subject to non-competition agreements. Accordingly, the adverse effect of losing key personnel could be compounded by our inability to prevent them from competing with us.\nWe have and may continue to enter into acquisitions, collaborations, in-licensing agreements, joint ventures, alliances or partnerships with third parties that could fail.\nWe have and may continue to enter into acquisitions, collaborations, in-licensing agreements, joint ventures, partnerships or undertake one or more of these transactions in order to retain our competitive position within the marketplace or to expand into new markets. Examples include our acquisitions of DOSE and Avedro, as well as our licensing of Santen\u2019s Preserflo MicroShunt, the Intratus drug delivery platform and the Attillaps pharmaceutical compounds. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete any future acquisition we may pursue, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner. Our future successes will depend, in part, on our ability to manage an expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for our management, such as the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing such expanded business or that we will realize the expected economies of scale, synergies and other benefits currently anticipated from recent or future acquisitions or strategic transactions. Additionally, these collaborations, joint ventures, and partnerships may fail to result in any commercialized product, including due to delays in or failures to obtain regulatory approvals, such as the approval delays with respect to the PreserFlo MicroShunt, and could require us to invest a substantial amount of resources only to ultimately fail. In addition, these arrangements may be terminated before we are able to realize net sales to sufficiently cover the costs associated therewith, which could materially impact our business. We cannot assure you that any such transaction would result in the benefits expected from the transaction, including revenue growth, increased profitability or an enhancement in our business prospects. Further, pursuing acquisitions, collaborations, in licensing agreements, joint ventures, alliances or partnerships with third parties, whether or not completed, is costly and time-consuming and could distract Company management from the operation of the business, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber incidents, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, operating results, or the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe efficient operation of our global business depends on our information technology systems, including telecommunications, the internet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage sales and marketing data, accounting and financial functions, inventory management, product development tasks, clinical data, customer service and technical support functions. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power losses, computer system or data network failures, data corruption and security breaches or other cyber-based incidents, which we have experienced and which we continue to monitor. Cyber incidents can include ransomware, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, and other malicious software programs introduced to our computers and networks, including intrusions that are disguised and evade detection for an extended period of time, phishing attacks, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage. While none of the cyber incidents or service interruptions that we have experienced to date have had a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operations, we cannot assure that future incidents will not materially and adversely impact us. In addition, a variety of our software systems are cloud-based data management applications, hosted by third-party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks. The failure to protect either our or our service providers\u2019 information technology infrastructure could disrupt our entire operation or result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, product shortages, loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, intellectual property or sensitive or personal information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, which was implemented in 2020, is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, record transactions, and prepare our financial statements. Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our ERP system (whether in connection with the regular operation, periodic enhancements or upgrades of such systems, or due to cyber incidents) could adversely affect our ability to provide services, fulfill contractual obligations, file reports with the SEC in a timely manner, operate our business or otherwise affect our controls environment. If our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with data privacy and security laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to state, federal and foreign laws relating to data privacy and security in the conduct of our business, including state breach notification laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the UK Data Protection Act and the UK GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), among others. These laws affect how we collect and use data of our employees, consultants, customers and other parties. These laws, as well as similar laws being enacted by other states and countries, impose substantial requirements that involve the expenditure of significant resources and the investment of significant time and effort to comply. We also rely on third parties to host or otherwise process some of this data. In some instances, these third parties have experienced failures to protect data privacy. Any failure by a third party to prevent security breaches could have adverse consequences for us. Our failure to comply with these laws or prevent security breaches of such data could result in significant liability under applicable laws, cause disruption to our business, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our net operating loss tax carryforwards will be available to offset future taxable income.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had approximately $491.4 million, $328.4 million and $12.3 million of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for federal, state and foreign purposes, respectively. Federal NOL carryforwards incurred prior to 2018 begin to expire in 2024, while federal NOL carryforwards of $239.2 million will not expire but can only be used to offset 80 percent of future taxable income. The state and foreign NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2022.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had federal and state R&D credit carryforwards of approximately $35.6 million and $18.4 million, respectively. Federal credits begin to expire in 2022, state credits of $4.1 million begin to expire in 2023, and state credits of $14.3 million carry over indefinitely. We continue to provide a valuation allowance against a portion of these tax attributes because we believe that uncertainty exists with respect to their future realization.\nUtilization of these tax attributes may be subject to annual limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC) Section 382 and Section 383 if the Company experiences an ownership change. To the extent available, we intend to use these NOL and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income and/or income tax liabilities associated with our operations. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period to utilize the remaining tax attributes before they expire.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness\nThe requirement that we service our indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for our operations and have other consequences that could adversely affect our business, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $287.5 million in principal amount of indebtedness as a result of the issuance of the Convertible Notes. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Interest payments, fees, covenants and restrictions under agreements governing our current or future indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, could have significant consequences, including the following: impairing our ability to\nsuccessfully continue to commercialize our current or future products; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms; increasing our vulnerability to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness; inhibiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; and diluting the interests of our existing stockholders if we issue shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. The occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows and ability to satisfy our obligations under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and any other indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance the amounts payable under our current or future indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, will depend on our operating and financial performance, which may be subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary investments in our business, and our cash needs may increase in the future. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or secure desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes.\nNoteholders may require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the occurrence of the fundamental change itself may lead to a default under any future credit facility or other agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of the Convertible Notes do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) and offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap.\nWe have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, which are expected to occur during the 40 trading day period beginning on the 41st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe option counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price subject to the cap and in the volatility of our common stock.\nIn addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nOur business, products and processes are subject to extensive regulation both in the U.S. and abroad and it can be costly to comply with these regulations. Any failure to adhere to applicable regulations could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur medical devices, drugs, drug/device combination products and other products are subject to extensive government regulation in the U.S. by the FDA, state regulatory authorities and foreign regulatory authorities in the countries in which we conduct business. These regulations relate to, among other things, R&D, labeling, advertising, promotion, pricing, and discounts, recordkeeping, reporting, import and export, post-approval studies and the sale and distribution of our products. See Item 1, Business, \u201cGovernment Regulation - U.S. Regulation & Reimbursement\u201d and \u201cInternational Regulation & Reimbursement\u201d for additional information.\nThe process of obtaining clearances or approvals to market our products can be expensive and lengthy, and we cannot guarantee that our current products will receive approval for additional indications or that our future products will receive clearance or approval on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, based upon a recent FDA determination, our pipeline products that are considered drug-device combination products will require review and coordination by each of\nFDA\u2019s drug and device centers prior to approval, which may delay approval. Before we can obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate, we may be required to undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory agencies, including internationally. We have experienced in the past, and could experience in the future, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials or testing that could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients in a timely manner or be completed on schedule, if at all. Conducting clinical trials is a complex and expensive process, can take many years, and outcomes are inherently uncertain. We incur substantial expense for, and devote significant time to, clinical trials but cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in commercial sales, even if we believe the results from such trials are positive. We may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results, and failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Any of our medical device products may malfunction and any of our products may produce undesirable adverse effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials. We, the clinical trial investigators, the independent review board responsible for overseeing the trial, the FDA, or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or trial protocols, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the product, lack of sufficient funding, or to avoid exposing trial participants to unacceptable health risks. Any delay or failure in clinical trials would delay or prevent our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIn some instances we or our partners have pursued, and may in the future pursue, a regulatory clearance or approval that has proven or proves unsuccessful, such as the delays experienced by the PreserFlo Microshunt and the change in regulatory pathway undertaken with respect to the iStent infinite, which in the past has, and in the future may, substantially increase the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval or could result in new competitive products reaching the market faster than our product candidate, which could materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite or timely approvals for commercialization of our product candidates.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations and applicable foreign laws and regulations. We may also be required to seek additional regulatory approvals to modify our approved products or their manufacturing processes, which may entail significant time and expense. We and our suppliers are subject to extensive post-marketing regulatory requirements and failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to enforcement actions, including product approval withdrawals. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. Other post-market requirements that may regulate our products include establishment registration and device listing, quality system and good manufacturing requirements, reporting of adverse events and device malfunctions, reporting of corrections and removals (recalls), labeling requirements, and promotional restrictions. Under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to the quality system and good manufacturing requirements applicable to both drugs and medical devices. Our products could malfunction, cause unexpected adverse events, or experience performance problems that require review and possible corrective action by us or a component supplier, including a recall or market withdrawal. Failure to conduct any required post-marketing studies for our approved products in a timely manner could result in the revocation of the approval for the product that is subject to such a requirement and could also result in the recall or withdrawal of the product. Any recall or product withdrawal, whether required by the FDA or another regulatory authority or initiated by us, could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales.\nThe FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities, which may include, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, recalls, refusals to grant or delays in granting requests, civil fines and penalties, operating restrictions, withdrawal of approvals and even criminal prosecution.\nIn addition, our promotional materials, sales techniques, pricing programs and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of a drug or medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA, also known as an \u201coff-label\u201d use. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may limit the indications for use of our products, thereby restricting our ability to promote the drug or device. Physicians may use our products, particularly newly-approved products just being commercialized, off-label,\nas the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician's choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. Moreover, surgeons may choose to use certain products or combinations of products in order to gain more favorable reimbursement treatment. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials, sales techniques, pricing programs or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use or encourages over-utilization of our products or use of our products in combinations that are not indicated or appropriate, it could request that we modify our materials, techniques, programs or training or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and transparency laws and regulations, among others, which are enforced by federal and state governments with respect to our marketing, training, customer arrangements, discount, rebate and pricing programs, product bundling, financial arrangements with physicians, patient assistance programs, reimbursement support services, and other practices. See Item 1, Business, \u201cGovernment Regulation - U.S. Regulation & Reimbursement\u201d and \u201cInternational Regulation & Reimbursement\u201d for additional information about the laws and regulations which apply to us. The U.S. Department of Justice has increased its scrutiny of interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as various patient and product support programs, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Although we try to structure our arrangements within available safe harbors whenever possible, we may nevertheless become subject to government scrutiny or investigation. Violations may result in civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business. In the foreign markets in which we operate, different pricing and reimbursement systems, which could result in lower reimbursement, could harm our ability to operate our business.\nWe are also subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their agents from making bribes or other improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries. Our exposure to international markets increases the inherent risks of encountering such issues. While our employees, distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that our training and internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws. Any actual or alleged violations of these laws and regulations could subject us to government investigations, criminal sanctions, severe fines and penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of the laws applicable to our business and products is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Responding to a government investigation is time and resource intensive, and may cause harm to our business and reputation even if we are able to successfully defend against it. Additionally, resolution of any such investigation may require agreement to onerous corporate integrity agreements or other compliance or reporting requirements, which may negatively affect our business.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system could hinder or prevent our products\u2019 commercial success.\nIn the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare systems in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably, if at all. In the U.S. in recent years, new legislation has been proposed and adopted at the federal and state levels that is effecting major changes in the healthcare system. In addition, new regulations and interpretations of existing healthcare statutes and regulations are frequently adopted and we may not be able to comply with the changed laws, they could increase the cost of manufacturing, marketing or selling our product, could make approvals of pipeline products more difficult or prevent us from selling at all. We expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the U.S. health care system that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof and may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of planned or future products. It is also difficult to predict whether and how the policies and priorities of a new administration could materially impact the regulation governing our products.\nWe may from time to time increase the prices of our products, as we have recently done with our Photrexa therapies. Drug pricing by pharmaceutical manufacturers is currently, and is expected to continue to be, under close scrutiny, including with respect to manufacturers that increase the price of products after acquiring those products from other companies. In some cases, such scrutiny has resulted in congressional inquiries and federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturers\u2019 patient support programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Although our price increases have been based upon third party studies of the projected economic value of our products to the healthcare system, we cannot guarantee they would not be subject to such scrutiny.\nIn May 2017, the EU adopted Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745 (MDR), which repealed and replaced the Medical Device Directive (MDD). MDR went into effect in May 2021. Although MDR does not set out a substantially different regulatory system than MDD, it provides for stricter controls of medical devices. Under provisions that govern the transition from MDD to MDR, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 2021 may continue to be marketed and sold as long as those certificates are valid (up to a maximum of five years from the date of issue) or until May 2024 at the latest. After the expiration of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under MDR may be placed on the market in the EU. Our failure to obtain CE marks for all of our products under MDR on a timely basis, or to comply with MDR, could restrict our ability to sell our products in the EU, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nBroader legislative changes may also impact our operations. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit) and the transition period ended on December 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU reached agreement regarding their future relationship on December 24, 2020. As a result of Brexit, there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports into and out of the U.K. and EU countries and regulatory complexities that could adversely impact the Company.\nIf, as a result of legislative or regulatory healthcare reform, we cannot sell our products profitably, whether due to our own inability to comply with, or the inability of other economic operators in our supply chain to qualify under, any legislative reform, our business would be harmed. In addition, any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.\nChanges to the reimbursement rates for our products may adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our products depends in significant part on adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.), managed care organizations and private health insurers. See Item 1, Business, \u201cGovernment Regulation - U.S. Regulation & Reimbursement\u201d and \u201cInternational Regulation & Reimbursement\u201d for additional information. Payors continually review the clinical evidence for new technologies and can change their coverage policies without notice or deny payment if the product was not used in accordance with the payor\u2019s coverage policy. Therefore, coverage for our products can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these products and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly and requires us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage will be obtained or will be maintained once it is obtained.\nIn addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement levels. Without sufficient reimbursement from governmental programs or third party commercial payors, patients may not be able to access our products. The demand for, and the profitability of, our products could be materially harmed if the Medicaid program, Medicare program, other healthcare programs in the U.S. or elsewhere, or third party commercial payors in the U.S. or elsewhere deny reimbursement for our products, limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed, or provide reimbursement only on unfavorable terms. Also, when procedures associated with our products transition from temporary CPT Category III codes to permanent CPT Category I codes, the physician and facility reimbursement levels associated with the procedures using these products could be decreased, such as the decreased payment rates for procedures using our iStent-related products, in conjunction with cataract surgery,\nestablished by CMS for 2022, as discussed earlier in these Risk Factors under the heading \u201cRisks Related to Our Business.\u201d Even when a permanent billing code has been assigned to a product, there is no guarantee that coverage will be provided. MACs have in the past, and may in the future, change coverage terms, which could result in inadequate reimbursement and impact the use of our products. If we are unable to maintain our existing codes or obtain new permanent codes for procedures using our products, or obtain new reimbursement codes for our other products in development, we may be subject to significant pricing pressure, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe cannot predict to what extent the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt global healthcare systems and access to our products or result in a widespread loss of individual health insurance coverage due to unemployment, a shift from commercial payor coverage to government payor coverage, or an increase in demand for patient assistance and/or free drug programs, any of which could adversely affect our net revenue. In addition, payers consistently engage in cost containment efforts, which could include efforts to decrease reimbursement levels for prescription drugs and the imposition of prior authorization for the use of our products. We cannot predict actions that third party payors may take, or whether they will limit the access to and level of reimbursement for our products or refuse to provide any approvals or coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors and other third parties could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, which would substantially impair our ability to compete.\nOur success and ability to compete depends significantly upon our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our proprietary rights and licensed intellectual property rights to the technologies and inventions used in or embodied by our products. We rely on a combination of patents and trademark rights, and to a lesser extent on trade secrets and copyrights, together with licenses and nondisclosure agreements to protect our technologies. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our business. We also have not pursued or maintained, and may not pursue or maintain in the future, patent protection for our products in every country or territory in which we sell or will in the future sell our products. In addition, we cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications or pending trademark applications will issue or that, if issued, they will issue in a form that will be advantageous to us.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately protect these rights, which could substantially impair our ability to compete. Our patents may be challenged and held invalid or we may be unable to extend the protection on products with expiring patents. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Further, although it is our policy to require each of our employees, consultants and any other parties who may be involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf to execute proprietary information and inventions agreements, we may be unsuccessful in doing so with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The relevant assignment provisions may not be self-executing or may be breached, resulting in ownership disputes and/or litigation.\nWe have several foreign patents and patent applications, and expect to pursue patent protection in the most significant markets in which we do business. The laws of other countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our product offerings and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. Many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining, protecting and defending such rights in international markets. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against other parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, and certain countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to other parties. We also may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries. If we encounter such difficulties or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in these countries, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate or control our future operating expenses in relation to obtaining, enforcing and/or defending intellectual property, which could lead to cash shortfalls. Our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation or costs associated with administrative proceedings and the results of such proceedings.\nWe have been and may in the future become involved in patent and other intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights, which could be costly, time consuming and unsuccessful and could interfere with our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nIntellectual property rights are essential to our business. We have asserted and may in the future need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our rights, or to invalidate or challenge the intellectual property rights of a third party, including those rights owned by our competitors. Additionally, third parties could assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our current or future commercial products and seek to invalidate one or more of our patents or trademarks. Intellectual property disputes often involve complex legal and factual questions, and could result in significant costs, substantial damages and our inability to manufacture, market or sell our existing or future products that are found to infringe. Even if we were to prevail in any such action, the litigation or administrative proceeding could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources that could materially and adversely affect our business. Such claims could arise in situations where certain employees, consultants or contractors were previous, or are currently, employed by other medical device, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, misappropriated the intellectual property or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information, of these former employers.\nThere is no guarantee that we would be successful enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights in court. A court could hold that some or all of our asserted intellectual property rights are not infringed, or could invalidate our rights, hold our rights unenforceable, or substantially narrow the scope of protection. Further, we could be prohibited from selling our products or a court could order us to pay compensatory damages as well as other penalties and fines. Any such adverse result would undermine our competitive position. Regardless of the final outcome, any litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company and Our Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Glaukos Charter) and amended and restated bylaws (Bylaws) may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u25cf require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u25cf specify that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the president;\n\u25cf establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf divide our board of directors into three classes, with each class serving staggered three year terms;\n\u25cf provide that our directors may be removed only for cause by a supermajority vote of our stockholders;\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u25cf specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u25cf require a supermajority vote of the stockholders and a majority vote of the board to amend certain of the above-mentioned provisions and our bylaws.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.\nThe exclusive forum provisions in our organizational documents could limit our stockholders' ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Glaukos Charter and Bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Glaukos Charter or our Bylaws, or (iv) any action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision). Further, our Bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act (the Federal Forum Provision). Our decision to adopt the Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law and means that suits brought by stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created under the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.\nThe Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the Federal Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Act and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act. The exclusive forum provisions in the Glaukos Charter and our Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and, accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal courts. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThe exclusive forum provisions in the Glaukos Charter and our Bylaws may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The court in the designated forum under our exclusive forum provisions may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to the Company than to our stockholders. Further, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies\u2019 organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find any of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find all or any part of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 15454, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "GKOS"}
