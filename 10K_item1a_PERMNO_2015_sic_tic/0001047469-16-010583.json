{"cik": "1411158", "company": "Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the adverse developments described in the following risk factors could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOur ability to curtail our losses and reach profitability is unproven, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe recorded a net loss of $61.2 million in 2015. With the exception of 2013, which was positively impacted by a significant legal settlement with Valeant, we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $278.8 million. Historically, we have allocated most of our financial resources to research and development, including our preclinical development activities and clinical studies. While Sandoz is responsible for all of its selling, marketing, distribution, general and administrative costs related to the commercialization of KERYDIN under the Sandoz Agreement (except for the Anacor Contribution in 2015), we expect that, as a general matter, our research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses for our product development candidates and approved products, respectively, will increase in the future as we continue our early-stage research, advance our discovery research projects into the preclinical stage and progress our product development candidates, including crisaborole, through clinical development and into the commercialization stage. For example, while we do not currently have an internal or contract commercial sales force or commercial infrastructure sufficient to support the potential launch of our product development candidates, we currently expect to establish such capabilities in preparation for the potential approval and launch of crisaborole in the United States. Such activities will be expensive and time-consuming. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to experience net losses and negative cash flows in 2016, and we cannot guarantee that payments under the Sandoz Agreement and any revenue generated from crisaborole, if approved, will be sufficient to offset losses in future years. These losses and negative cash flows have had, and unless we become profitable, will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of our expenses or when, or if, we will be able to attain or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase if we are required by the FDA to perform additional studies for crisaborole, or studies in addition to, or that are larger than, those that we currently expect for our other product development candidates. Whether we continue to incur future net losses will depend, in part, on our future expenses and our ability to generate revenues. Revenues from the Sandoz Agreement will depend in large part on the successful commercialization of KERYDIN. Prior to our entry into the Sandoz Agreement, we financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, debt arrangements, government contracts and grants and payments under our collaborations and research agreements with GSK, Lilly, the Gates Foundation and the United States Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (\"DTRA\") and our legal settlement with Valeant. Revenues from such collaborations and research agreements are uncertain because milestones or other contingent payments under them may not be achieved or received. In addition, we may not be able to enter into other collaborations that will generate significant cash. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product development candidates, including crisaborole, or if revenues from our approved product, KERYDIN, and, if\napproved, crisaborole, are insufficient, we will not achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur operations to date have been primarily limited to our early-stage research and undertaking preclinical and clinical studies of our product development candidates and we are reliant on collaborators with respect to certain of our product development candidates and our approved product, KERYDIN. In particular, under the Sandoz Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States. Consequently, any predictions regarding our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or greater control. Our financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u2022 the successful commercialization of KERYDIN pursuant to the Sandoz Agreement;\n\u2022 any issues, delays or failures arising as a result of our studies relating to our product development candidates, including crisaborole;\n\u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals, and content of approved labeling for our product development candidates, including any delay or failure by the FDA to approve crisaborole;\n\u2022 our ability to timely and successfully launch, either alone or with a partner, crisaborole, if approved;\n\u2022 competition from existing products or new products, including Jublia, Valeant's efinaconazole product approved by the FDA for the treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails in the United States in June 2014;\n\u2022 our dependency on third-party manufacturers to supply or manufacture our products, including KERYDIN and, if approved, crisaborole;\n\u2022 our ability to establish effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in a timely manner;\n\u2022 market acceptance of KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, and our other product development candidates;\n\u2022 delays in the commencement, enrollment and timing of clinical testing for our product development candidates;\n\u2022 potential side effects that could delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product development candidates or cause our approved drugs to be taken off the market;\n\u2022 the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from federal, state and private healthcare payors for our approved products;\n\u2022 our ability to generate or obtain additional funding to develop our product development candidates;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize KERYDIN, crisaborole and our other product development candidates outside of the United States;\n\u2022 our ability to establish or maintain collaboration, licensing or other arrangements;\n\u2022 our ability, and the ability of third parties, to protect and defend intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 costs related to, and outcomes from, potential litigation or other proceedings;\n\u2022 our ability to adequately support future growth;\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain our accounting systems and controls;\n\u2022 potential product liability claims;\n\u2022 potential liabilities associated with hazardous materials; and\n\u2022 our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage.\nDue to, among others, the various factors mentioned above, our results during any quarterly or annual period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance.\nWe may continue to require substantial additional capital and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs.\nThe development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products is expensive. The costs include those associated with conducting preclinical and clinical studies, interactions with regulatory authorities and the expenses associated with product commercialization. If, for example, the FDA requires that we perform additional studies beyond those that we currently expect, our expenses could increase materially beyond what we currently anticipate and the timing of any potential product approval may be delayed. Although we believe that our existing capital resources, together with the payments we expect to receive based on sales of KERYDIN pursuant to the Sandoz Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operating requirements beyond that period, including our commercialization activities relating to crisaborole, if approved, and our research and development activities. Furthermore, any delays in, or unanticipated costs associated with, our development, regulatory or commercialization efforts could significantly increase the amount of additional capital required for us to conduct such activities and meet our operating requirements beyond the next twelve months. Our forecast regarding the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results, including the costs to maintain our currently planned operations, could vary materially.\nUnless and until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our products, including KERYDIN under the Sandoz Agreement and crisaborole (if approved), we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or licensing, collaboration or other similar arrangements, or a combination of these sources. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts and may not be able to make scheduled debt payments on a timely basis or at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock (such as the Convertible Senior Notes), our stockholders may experience additional dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and the granting of security interests over our assets. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products or product development candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time.\nOur forecasts regarding the period of time that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements and the timing of our future capital resource requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the successful commercialization of KERYDIN pursuant to the Sandoz Agreement;\n\u2022 any issues, delays or failures arising as a result of our studies relating to our product development candidates, including crisaborole;\n\u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals, and content of approved labeling for our product development candidates, including any delay or failure by the FDA to approve crisaborole;\n\u2022 our ability to timely and successfully launch, either alone or with a partner, crisaborole, if approved;\n\u2022 the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from federal, state and private healthcare payors for KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, and our other future approved products, if any;\n\u2022 the effects of competing technological and market developments, including Jublia, Valeant's efinaconazole product approved by the FDA for the treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails in the United States in June 2014;\n\u2022 the cost and timing of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities;\n\u2022 the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product development candidates, including crisaborole;\n\u2022 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical and clinical studies for our product development candidates and potential product development candidates;\n\u2022 the timing and cost of our activities relating to our regulatory filings for our product development candidates, including crisaborole;\n\u2022 the success of our collaborations and research agreements, including the attainment of milestones and royalty payments, if any, under those agreements;\n\u2022 the number and characteristics of the product development candidates that we pursue;\n\u2022 the terms and timing of any future collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights, and the outcome of litigation or other proceedings relating to our patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies; and\n\u2022 the impact of general economic, industry, market or political conditions.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our indebtedness. In addition, we could incur additional indebtedness that could have adverse effects on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total indebtedness of $90.2 million, which was comprised of the Convertible Senior Notes issued in October 2014. Our ability to pay interest on, repay or refinance our indebtedness, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the\nfuture sufficient to service our indebtedness, fund our research and development activities and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, refinancing indebtedness, restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or to engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn the future, we may incur additional indebtedness in connection with financing acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. Any increase in our indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate enough cash to satisfy our debt obligations and could have other important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness or greater cash flow; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, commercialization activities, product development programs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, the agreements that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests and may require the granting of security interests over our assets. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, potential foreclosure on our assets and other adverse results.\nRisks Relating to the Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Our Product and Product Development Candidates\nIf KERYDIN fails to timely achieve and sustain commercial success, our business will suffer, our future prospects may be harmed and our stock price would likely decline.\nKERYDIN is our first product approved by the FDA and is our first commercialized product. Unless and until we successfully commercialize another product development candidate or obtain approval to market KERYDIN, directly or through a collaboration, in jurisdictions outside of the United States, the payments that we receive under the Sandoz Agreement will constitute the entirety of our revenues from product sales. The amount of such payments will depend largely on the commercial success of KERYDIN, which will determine the level of gross profit sharing payments, if any, in excess of any minimum amounts that we are entitled to under the Sandoz Agreement. In addition, Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales, marketing and other commercialization matters under the Sandoz Agreement, including pricing and reimbursement matters. We have limited ability to control such decisions, which may affect the\ncommercial success of KERYDIN. The commercial success of KERYDIN will depend on, and may be limited by, a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 acceptance of and ongoing satisfaction with KERYDIN by the medical community, patients receiving treatment and third-party payors in the United States, and eventually in foreign markets to the extent we seek and receive marketing approvals abroad;\n\u2022 KERYDIN's market share;\n\u2022 the extent and effectiveness of the development, sales and marketing and distribution support KERYDIN receives from Sandoz;\n\u2022 the amount of resources utilized and efforts made by Sandoz in relation to the commercialization of KERYDIN;\n\u2022 the success of competing products, including whether Jublia, Valeant's efinaconazole product approved by the FDA for the treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails in the United States in June 2014, or other competing products or therapies, are prescribed instead of KERYDIN for certain patients or are perceived as superior to, or more cost-effective than, KERYDIN by physicians or patients;\n\u2022 the extent of coverage or reimbursement for KERYDIN by government healthcare programs and third-party payors, including private health coverage insurers and health maintenance organizations; and\n\u2022 the ability of patients to afford any required co-payments for KERYDIN.\nAs discussed above, we have limited ability under the Sandoz Agreement to control decisions that may affect the commercial success of KERYDIN. If Sandoz is unable to successfully commercialize KERYDIN, our revenues would be impacted and our business would be seriously harmed.\nWe cannot be certain that crisaborole or any of our other wholly-owned or partnered product development candidates will receive regulatory approval, and without regulatory approval our product development candidates will not be able to be marketed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of crisaborole and our other product development candidates, and our ability to generate significant revenue related to product sales will depend on the successful development and regulatory approval of crisaborole and our other product development candidates. The development and regulatory review process typically takes years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. Drug candidates can and do fail at many stages of the process, including as a result of unfavorable clinical study results. The development of a product development candidate, including preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, quality systems, labeling, approval, record-keeping, selling, promotion, marketing and distribution of products, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities in other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product development candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA.\nCurrently, our lead product development candidate is crisaborole, a novel non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. In July 2015, we announced top-line results from our two Phase 3 pivotal studies of crisaborole in patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis and, in October 2015, we announced top-line results from our long-term safety study of crisaborole in patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. In January 2016, we submitted to the FDA an NDA seeking approval of crisaborole for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a complex, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process that involves a high degree of risk. Only a small percentage of drugs in\ndevelopment in the United States successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product development candidate's safety and effectiveness for each indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or additional clinical studies. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.\nIf a product is approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the product may be used, include extensive warnings on the product labeling or require costly ongoing requirements for post-marketing clinical studies and surveillance or other risk management measures to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Markets outside of the United States also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing. Obtaining regulatory approval for the marketing of a product development candidate in one country does not ensure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries. Any regulatory approval of any of our products or product development candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. If crisaborole or any of our other wholly-owned or partnered product development candidates do not receive regulatory approval, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or to continue our operations. Moreover, our submission of an NDA or our receipt of regulatory approval with respect to any product does not assure the commercial success of such product.\nAll of our product development candidates require regulatory review and approval prior to commercialization. Any delay in the regulatory review or approval of any of our product development candidates, including crisaborole, will harm our business.\nAll of our product development candidates, including crisaborole, require regulatory review and approval prior to commercialization. Our NDA for crisaborole was submitted to the FDA in January 2016. Any delays in the regulatory review or approval of crisaborole or our future product development candidates may delay market launch, increase our cash requirements and result in additional operating losses.\nRegulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. The process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals, including foreign approvals, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. Furthermore, this approval process is extremely complex, expensive and uncertain. We or our current or potential future partners may be unable to successfully submit NDAs in the United States or marketing approval applications or other foreign applications for any of our products. Upon submitting an NDA, including any amendments or supplements to the NDA, to the FDA seeking marketing approval for any of our product development candidates, the FDA must decide whether to either accept or reject the submission for filing. We cannot be certain that these submissions, including the submission of our NDA for crisaborole, will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA, or that any marketing approval application submissions to any other regulatory authorities will be accepted for filing and review by those authorities. We cannot be certain that we or our partners will be able to respond to any regulatory requests during the review period in a timely manner without delaying potential regulatory action. We also cannot be certain that any of our product development candidates, including crisaborole, will receive favorable recommendations from any FDA advisory committee or foreign regulatory bodies or be approved for marketing by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Delays in approvals or rejections of marketing applications may be based upon many factors, including regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data and studies, regulatory\nquestions regarding data and results, recommendations made in regulatory advice letters, changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the emergence of new information regarding our product development candidates or other products. Delays and uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval processes in other countries may result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. In addition, decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products.\nData obtained from preclinical and clinical studies are subject to different interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory review or approval of any of our product development candidates. For example, if preclinical results suggest a potential for drug-drug interactions (\"DDI\"), clinical studies are generally conducted to assess the likelihood of DDI and their potential impact on product safety. Although, to date, we have not been requested to perform DDI studies for crisaborole by the FDA, we nevertheless completed a healthy-volunteer DDI clinical study in February 2014 demonstrating that crisaborole and its metabolites do not interact with cytochrome P450 subtype 2C9. However, if any DDI studies are required, it may delay any potential product approval and may increase the expenses associated with clinical programs. Furthermore, regulatory attitudes towards the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, policy changes and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We do not know whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects.\nIn addition, the environment in which our regulatory submissions may be reviewed changes over time. For example, average review times at the FDA for NDAs have fluctuated over the last ten years, and we cannot predict the review time for any of our submissions with any regulatory authorities. Review times can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. While under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has twelve months from submission in which to complete its review of a standard application, and eight months for a priority application, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates and in certain circumstances the PDUFA goal dates may be extended. Moreover, in light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Government Accounting Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and establishment of REMS that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical studies. Data from clinical studies may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical studies before completion, or require longer or additional clinical studies that may result in substantial additional expense, a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nWe have never marketed a drug before, have only recently begun building an infrastructure to support a commercial organization and do not currently have a commercial organization sufficient to support the commercial launch of crisaborole, if approved, or any other approved product. If we are unable to establish such capabilities on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we may not be able to commercialize crisaborole, if approved, or any other approved products successfully.\nThe marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products in U.S. specialty markets require a commercial infrastructure and the implementation of such infrastructure requires substantial resources and time. Under the Sandoz Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales, marketing and other commercialization matters, including pricing and reimbursement matters. While we do not currently\nhave an internal or contract commercial sales force or commercial infrastructure sufficient to support the potential launch of our product development candidates, we currently expect to establish such capabilities in preparation for the potential approval and launch of crisaborole in the United States. In order to commercialize crisaborole, if approved, we must build our marketing, sales, distribution, management and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If crisaborole receives FDA approval, we expect to establish a commercial organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize crisaborole, which will be expensive and time-consuming. We have only recently begun building such an infrastructure and have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. There are significant risks involved in building and managing a commercial organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals with expertise in the markets we expect to serve, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. We intend to continue to evaluate how best to commercialize our product development candidates, if approved, in the United States and internationally, and may choose to collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing capabilities and established distribution systems, either to augment our own capabilities or in lieu thereof. If we are unable to timely establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities alone or in collaboration with third parties, we may not be able to commercialize crisaborole or any other approved products successfully and our revenues, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf our approved products do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that are generated from their sales will be limited.\nThe commercial success of KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, and our other future approved products, if any, depends upon the acceptance of these products among physicians, patients and healthcare payors. The degree of market acceptance of our approved products may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 limitations, warnings or precautions contained in the FDA-approved labeling for our products, whether based on \"class labelling\" concerns or otherwise;\n\u2022 changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for any of our products;\n\u2022 limitations in the approved indications for our products;\n\u2022 lower demonstrated clinical safety or efficacy compared to other products;\n\u2022 occurrence of significant adverse side effects;\n\u2022 ineffective sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022 lack of coverage or reimbursement from government healthcare programs and third-party payors, including private health coverage insurers and health maintenance organizations;\n\u2022 timing of market introduction and perceived safety and effectiveness of competitive products, taking into account information provided in competitor product package inserts;\n\u2022 lack of cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022 availability of attractive alternative therapies, or other products with similar results at similar or lower cost, including generics and over-the-counter products;\n\u2022 adverse publicity about our products or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022 relative lack of convenience and ease of administration of our products; and\n\u2022 potential product liability claims.\nIf KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, and our other future approved products, if any, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors and patients, sufficient revenue may not be generated from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, efforts to educate the medical community and healthcare payors on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful. We cannot be certain that KERYDIN or crisaborole, if approved, will achieve an adequate level of acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors and patients. Additionally, our product development candidates intended for use against neglected diseases, such as AN5568 for HAT and our product development candidate for TB, are not expected to generate significant revenues, if any.\nUndesirable side effects may delay or prevent marketing approval of our product development candidates, require that our approved products be taken off the market or otherwise limit the sales of our approved products.\nUnforeseen side effects may arise during clinical development or after an approved product has been marketed. For example, during our Phase 3 pivotal studies of crisaborole, a small number of patients being treated for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis experienced application site pain and upper respiratory tract infections. While the range and potential severity of possible side effects from systemic therapies is generally greater than for topically administered drugs, the results of future clinical studies may show that KERYDIN or our product development candidates, including crisaborole, cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies or result in the delay of, failure to obtain or failure to maintain marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nIf undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by our product are identified after such product receives marketing approval:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require changes to the label, including the inclusion of specific warnings or contraindications, and may issue field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022 we or contractual partners may be subject to limitations on how the product may be promoted;\n\u2022 sales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require us to take our product off the market;\n\u2022 we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our current or potential future partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of the product.\nKERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, and our other future approved products, if any, will face competition and most of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. KERYDIN competes, and crisaborole, if approved, and our other future approved products, if any, will compete, with products marketed by numerous other pharmaceutical companies, including large fully-integrated companies, with financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and distribution, legal, regulatory and product development resources substantially greater than ours. As a result, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval\nof their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain regulatory- or intellectual property-based exclusivity that limits our ability to develop or commercialize our product development candidates. Our competitors also may develop drugs that have superior safety profiles or are more effective, widely used or less costly than our products and also may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. The ability of KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, and our other future approved products, if any, to compete with products sold by our competitors will depend on a number of factors, including product efficacy, safety, price and convenience. For example, KERYDIN competes with Jublia, Valeant's efinaconazole product approved by the FDA for the treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails in the United States in June 2014, and we cannot be certain that KERYDIN will achieve or maintain a high level of acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors and patients as compared to Jublia.\nThe specialty markets in which we operate or intend to operate are competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nKERYDIN has faced, and we believe will continue to face, competition from Jublia, as well as other currently marketed nail fungal therapeutics, including Penlac, Lamisil, Sporanox, Onmel and generic versions of those compounds. KERYDIN also competes with lasers, which have received clearance from the FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis, over-the-counter products and debridement. There are also several potential treatments for onychomycosis in development by other companies. For example, Topica Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed a Phase 2b/3 clinical study of 10% Luliconazole Solution to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different dosing regimens in the third quarter of 2014 and is currently seeking a partner for Phase 3 development and commercialization of its product development candidate. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Viamet Pharmaceuticals, Inc. commenced a Phase 2b clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral VT-1161, with top-line data expected during the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, several companies are pursuing various devices for onychomycosis, including laser technology. Similarly, if crisaborole is approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, we anticipate that it would compete against a number of approved treatments, including topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone acetonide, Locoid (hydrocortisone butyrate) and Clobex (clobetasol propionate), and topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as Elidel (pimecrolimus) and Protopic (tacrolimus), antibiotics and antihistamines. Crisaborole may one day also compete against: (i) current systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis, which include corticosteroids (primarily prednisone), cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil, and (ii) potential treatments for atopic dermatitis in development by other companies, which include dupilumab, ixekizumab, Toctino (oral alitretinoin), Otezla (apremilast), Welichem Biotech Inc.'s compound WBI-1001/GSK2894512, licensed to GSK, Eisai Co., Ltd.'s E6005, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.'s OPA-15406 and Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s VTP-38543. In addition, each of our product development candidates may compete against other product development candidates currently under development by other companies.\nEven if a generic product or an over-the-counter product is less effective than our product, a less effective generic or over-the-counter product may be more quickly adopted by health insurers and patients than our product based upon cost or convenience.\nReimbursement decisions by healthcare payors may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance. If there is not sufficient reimbursement for KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, and our other future approved products, if any, it is less likely that our products will be widely used.\nSuccessful commercialization of pharmaceutical products usually depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors at the federal, state and private levels. Patients or healthcare providers who purchase drugs generally rely on healthcare payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with such products. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from\ngovernmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors, such as HMOs and insurance companies, can be essential to new product acceptance.\nReimbursement decisions by healthcare payors may have an effect on pricing and market acceptance. Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales, marketing and other commercialization matters under the Sandoz Agreement, including pricing and reimbursement matters. Consequently, we have limited ability to influence such decisions with respect to KERYDIN. We can give no assurance as to the extent to which KERYDIN will be reimbursed in any future periods. If approved, our product development candidates, such as crisaborole, also will be subject to uncertain reimbursement decisions by healthcare payors. Our products are less likely to be used if they do not receive adequate reimbursement.\nThe market for our products and product development candidates may depend on access to healthcare payors' drug formularies, or lists of prescription drugs for which healthcare payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Industry competition to be included in such formularies results in downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Healthcare payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies when a competing generic product is available.\nIn the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for prescription drugs exists among all payors. Therefore, coverage of, and reimbursement for, drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor and can be difficult and costly to obtain. In addition, healthcare payors, whether governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. For example, private health insurers often employ formulary tier co-pay differentials, and private health insurers and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceutical products. This cost shifting has given patients greater control over product choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription drug costs and may cause patients to favor lower cost branded or generic alternatives to our products. Payors are also increasingly employing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded product. Additionally, some healthcare payors are requiring preapproval of coverage for new or innovative branded drug therapies before they will reimburse such therapies. As the payor market consolidates further and as more branded products become available at a lower cost, whether in generic form or otherwise, we may face greater pricing pressure from healthcare payors.\nVirtually all countries regulate or set the prices of pharmaceutical products, which is a separate determination from whether a particular product will be subject to reimbursement under that government's health plans. There are systems for reimbursement and pricing approval in each country and moving a product through those systems is time consuming and expensive.\nOur failure to obtain timely or adequate formulary placement for our products or any cost-containment measures adopted by healthcare payors, including those listed above, could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical studies could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product development candidates.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical studies could increase our product development costs or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval of our product development candidates. Clinical studies for our product development candidates may not begin when\nexpected or, if commenced, be completed on schedule or at all. The commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022 our inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\"CROs\") and study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and study sites;\n\u2022 regulatory objections to commencing a clinical study;\n\u2022 our inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of study sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical study programs, including some that may be for the same indication as our product development candidates;\n\u2022 the withdrawal of clinical study sites from our clinical studies as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical studies;\n\u2022 our inability to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical study at prospective sites;\n\u2022 difficulty recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical studies for a variety of reasons, including meeting the enrollment criteria for our study and competition from other clinical study programs for the same indication as our product development candidates; and\n\u2022 our inability to retain patients in clinical studies due to the treatment protocol, personal issues, side effects from the therapy or lack of efficacy, particularly for those patients receiving either a vehicle without the active ingredient or a placebo.\nIn addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, our current or any future partners, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 our failure to conduct the clinical study in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022 a failed inspection of the clinical study operations or study sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 unforeseen safety or efficacy issues or any determination that a clinical study presents unacceptable health risks; or\n\u2022 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study due to unforeseen costs resulting from enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional studies, increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties or other reasons.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical studies or other testing of our product development candidates, including crisaborole, beyond those currently contemplated, we may be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, marketing approval for such product development candidates.\nIn addition, if our current or any future partners assume development of our product development candidates, they may suspend or terminate their development and commercialization efforts, including clinical studies for our product development candidates, at any time. For example, in September 2013, Lilly notified us that it was ceasing further development of a compound it licensed in August 2011 for an animal health indication and has granted us a fully paid, sublicenseable, perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive license to the related technology and patents. Similarly, GSK discontinued clinical development of AN3365 in October 2012 and all rights to AN3365 have reverted to us.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we or our partners may be required by appropriate regulatory authorities to amend clinical study protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us or our partners to resubmit clinical study protocols to IRBs for\nreexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical study. If we or our partners experience delays in the completion of, or if we or our partners terminate clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product development candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate revenue from sales of our products will be prevented or delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies ultimately may lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product development candidate.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Because the results of earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product development candidate that we or our current or potential future partners advance through clinical studies may not have favorable results in later clinical studies or receive regulatory approval.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or our partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. In addition, data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product development candidate. Frequently, product development candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical studies have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical studies, including, for example, failures to demonstrate statistically significant results supporting the efficacy of such product development candidates. Clinical studies of product development candidates often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. In addition, the design of a clinical study can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical study may not become apparent until the clinical study is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical studies and may be unable to design and execute a clinical study to support regulatory approval. If any of our product development candidates are found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we or our collaborators may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for them and our business could be harmed. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 pivotal studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical studies.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different studies of the same product development candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in study protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen, particularly for self-administered topical drugs, and the rate of dropout among clinical study participants. We do not know whether any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical studies we or any of our partners may conduct will demonstrate consistent and/or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product development candidates.\nWe have limited experience in conducting Phase 3 clinical studies and submitting NDAs for product development candidates.\nThe proper conduct of Phase 3 pivotal studies is essential in obtaining regulatory approval and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process. Although our NDA for KERYDIN was accepted for filing by the FDA in September 2013 and approved by the FDA in July 2014, and our NDA for crisaborole was submitted in January 2016, we have limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings. We did not file an SPA with the FDA with respect to our crisaborole Phase 3 pivotal studies in mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. Consequently, we may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval of crisaborole.\nOur use of boron chemistry to develop pharmaceutical product development candidates is novel and may not prove successful in producing additional approved products. Undesirable side effects arising with respect to any of our product development candidates, or of boron-based drugs developed by others, may extend the time period required to obtain regulatory approval or harm market acceptance of our product development candidates, if approved.\nAll of our product development activities are centered on compounds containing boron. The use of boron chemistry to develop new drugs is largely unproven. If boron-based compounds developed by us or others have significant adverse side effects, regulatory authorities could require additional studies of our boron-based compounds, which could delay the timing of and increase the cost for regulatory approvals of our product development candidates. Additionally, adverse side effects for other boron-based compounds could affect the willingness of healthcare payors and medical providers to provide reimbursement for or use our boron-based drugs and could impact market acceptance of our products.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that boron-based products will be free of significant adverse side effects. During clinical studies, a small number of patients who received KERYDIN experienced some skin irritation around their toenails. In addition, during our Phase 3 pivotal studies of crisaborole, a small number of patients who received crisaborole experienced application site pain and upper respiratory tract infections. If boron-based drug treatments result in significant adverse side effects, they may not be useful as therapeutic agents. If we are unable to develop products that are safe and effective using our boron chemistry platform, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nHealthcare policy changes, including the Healthcare Reform Act, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. We anticipate that a portion of our KERYDIN and, if approved, crisaborole revenue will be derived from United States government healthcare programs, including Medicare. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act imposes a non-deductible excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \"branded prescription drugs,\" which includes innovator drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs or generics), to U.S. government programs. The Healthcare Reform Act and other healthcare reform measures adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry, significantly impact the profitability of our approved products and cause us to limit or terminate our spending on product development candidates.\nIn addition, we expect that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and healthcare payors intended to lower healthcare costs and potentially expand individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available from public and private healthcare payors for our approved products, or may increase the tax requirements for life sciences companies such as us. While we are unable to predict what impact the Healthcare Reform Act or any additional legislation, regulation or policy reforms may have on us, such reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently expect that a portion of the market for our products will be outside the United States. Our products approved in the United States and product development candidates may never receive approval or be commercialized outside of the United States.\nWe may enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties for international sales of our approved products. To market and commercialize products outside of the United States, we or any third parties that are marketing or selling our products must comply with numerous and varying foreign regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and may involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The regulatory approval process in foreign countries may involve risks and uncertainties similar to those present in the United States, as well as other risks and uncertainties such as those relating to drug pricing, which may require negotiations with foreign governments or agencies of foreign governments prior to commercialization. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have adverse effects similar to those seen in the United States regulatory approval process. In addition, regulatory approval in foreign countries may require further efforts to obtain adequate pricing or reimbursement from foreign regulatory authorities. As a result, regulatory risks include the possibility that our product development candidates may not be approved for all indications requested, or at all, which could limit the uses of our approved products and have an adverse effect on our product sales or potential royalties.\nEven if our product development candidates receive regulatory approval, we may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for our product development candidates, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions with respect to the indicated uses or marketing of our approved products or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. Given the number of high profile adverse safety events with certain drug products, regulatory authorities may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, expedited reporting of certain AEs, pre-approval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising. For example, any labeling approved for any of our products may include a restriction on the term of its use, or it may not include one or more of our intended indications. Furthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development, clinical studies and regulatory review and approval, as well as increased costs to assure compliance with any new post-approval regulatory requirements. Any of these restrictions or requirements could force us or our partners to conduct additional costly studies.\nEach of our approved products will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements relating to product labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Furthermore, any post-approval changes to an approved NDA, including KERYDIN's NDA, such as a change in the manufacturing site, manufacturing process, drug specifications, drug container, drug packaging or labeling, are subject to varying degrees of FDA review depending on the categorization of the change as a \"major change,\" \"moderate change\" or \"minor change.\" Any such proposed change may not be accepted or approved by the FDA, and failure to obtain such acceptance or approval may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, manufacturers of approved products are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including those requiring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities assessing compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work\nmust continue to expend time, money and effort in many areas of regulatory compliance with respect to our approved products, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We also will be required to report certain AEs and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion of our approved products. The timing of our obligation to report AEs with respect to our approved products is triggered by the date we become aware of the AE as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable AE, especially if it is not reported to us as an AE or if it is an AE that is unexpected or separated in time from the use of our product.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, it may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If any of our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022 issue warning letters;\n\u2022 mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022 require us or our partners to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022 impose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022 suspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u2022 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, our partners or our potential future partners;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIn addition, the occurrence of any of the foregoing, even if promptly remedied, could negatively impact the perception of us or the relevant product among the medical community, patients or third-party payors.\nPharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical studies of limited duration. After approval, such products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients. We and others (including regulatory agencies and private payors) collect extensive information, and may conduct post-marketing clinical studies, on the efficacy and safety of our products following approval. New safety or efficacy data from these sources may result in product label changes that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in reduced sales. Serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market, as well as product liability claims.\nWe currently are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting \"kickbacks\" and false or fraudulent claims, and federal and state physician payment disclosure laws that, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by regional, national, state and local agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies, as well as governmental authorities in those foreign countries in which we may commercialize our products. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern to varying degrees the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including preclinical testing, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information and promotion. These statutes and regulations include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes.\nThe federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting identified common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.\nSeveral pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company's marketing of the product for unapproved and, thus, non-reimbursable, uses. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have also been prosecuted on other legal theories of Medicare fraud. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback statute and federal false claims laws that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a company's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. Federal \"sunshine\" laws require transparency regarding financial arrangements with healthcare providers, including requiring applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure requirements regarding payments and any other \"transfer of value\" made or distributed to prescribers, physicians, teaching hospitals and other healthcare providers. Several states have similar healthcare professional aggregate spend reporting obligations that require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and prohibit or require reporting of the provision of gifts, meals and entertainment to individual healthcare providers. Other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies. In addition, California requires pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals. We have adopted a comprehensive compliance program that we believe satisfies the California law. Additional states may in the future implement similar requirements. Compliance with these laws is\ndifficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPromotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product's approved label. The FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (\"OPDP\"), formerly the Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communications, is responsible for reviewing prescription drug advertising and promotional labeling to ensure that the information contained in these materials is not false or misleading. There are specific disclosure requirements and the applicable regulations mandate that advertisements cannot be false or misleading or omit material facts about the product. Prescription drug promotional materials must present a fair balance between the drug's effectiveness and the risks associated with its use. Most warning letters from OPDP cite inadequate disclosure of risk information. In addition, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. If a regulatory agency disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, it may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market.\nIn addition to the federal anti-kickback statute and federal false claims laws, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") created federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. State and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nWhile we do not currently have an internal or contract commercial sales force or commercial infrastructure sufficient to support the potential launch of our product development candidates, we currently expect to establish such capabilities in preparation for the potential approval and launch of crisaborole in the United States. We intend to continue to evaluate how best to commercialize our product development candidates, if approved, in the United States and internationally, and may choose to collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing capabilities and established distribution systems, either to augment our own capabilities or in lieu thereof. We expect that government and regulatory agencies will hold us responsible for any actions by our sales representatives or sales organizations. If we or our contract sales organization, if any, fails to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable United States and foreign regulatory authorities or if previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we and our partners could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions.\nIf we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under United States federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly.\nCurrent healthcare laws and regulations and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the healthcare system may affect our ability to profitably sell any products that we may develop.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nIn 2010, the Healthcare Reform Act became law in the United States. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and includes, among others, the following measures of importance to the pharmaceutical industry:\n\u2022 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022 an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022 a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022 extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022 requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Healthcare Reform Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \"transfer of value\" made or distributed to teaching hospitals, prescribers and other healthcare providers, and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;\n\u2022 a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022 expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal false claims laws and the federal anti-kickback statute, additional government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022 a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u2022 a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and\n\u2022 a Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board empowered to recommend cost reduction policies under certain circumstances.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created, among others, measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe anticipate that the Healthcare Reform Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our approved products, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Insurers may also refuse to provide coverage with respect to uses of approved products for indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse for any newly-approved products, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of such products.\nWe also cannot be certain that KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, or our other future approved products, if any, will successfully be placed on the list of drugs covered by particular health plan formularies, nor can we predict the negotiated price for such products, which will be determined by market factors. Many states have also created preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. If KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, or our other future approved products, if any, are not included on these preferred drug lists, physicians may not be inclined to prescribe them to their patients, thereby diminishing the potential market for such products. Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales, marketing and other commercialization matters under the Sandoz Agreement, including pricing and reimbursement matters. Consequently, we have limited ability to influence such decisions with respect to KERYDIN.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may affect the use of our products.\nGovernment agencies may issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us, our partners, our potential future partners and our products and product development candidates. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the healthcare and patient communities. These guidelines and recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related or competing therapies. Changes to these guidelines and recommendations advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of our products, including KERYDIN and, if approved, crisaborole, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe are dependent on Sandoz for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States, and our ability to generate revenues from KERYDIN will depend on sales of this product by Sandoz in the United States.\nUnless and until we obtain approval to market KERYDIN, directly or through a collaboration, in jurisdictions outside of the United States, our ability to generate revenue from KERYDIN will depend on payments that we receive from Sandoz under the Sandoz Agreement. Under the Sandoz Agreement, we are entitled to 50% of the gross profits (defined as net sales less cost of goods sold) accrued by Sandoz on sales of KERYDIN, except that, in 2015, we were entitled to start receiving gross profit sharing payments only after the first $50.0 million of gross profits had been accrued by Sandoz. The gross profit sharing arrangement entitles us to cumulative minimum gross profit sharing payments of $65.0 million for each of 2016 and 2017. We are not entitled to cumulative minimum gross profit sharing payments under the Sandoz Agreement for any years other than 2016 and 2017. The level of gross profit sharing payments, if any, in excess of any minimum amounts that we are entitled to under the Sandoz Agreement will depend on the level of commercial success that KERYDIN achieves. Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales (including setting the price for KERYDIN), marketing and other commercialization matters under the Sandoz Agreement, including pricing and reimbursement matters. We have limited ability to control such decisions, which may affect the commercial success of KERYDIN. If Sandoz does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of KERYDIN, is ineffective in doing so or is otherwise unable to successfully commercialize KERYDIN, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, Sandoz may terminate the Sandoz Agreement for convenience upon 180 days' prior written notice, subject to the payment to us (to the extent then unpaid) of any minimum gross profit sharing amounts. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Sandoz will continue to distribute and commercialize KERYDIN through the full initial term of the Sandoz Agreement (or any renewal term thereof).\nWe have limited experience manufacturing API, product development candidates or approved products on a large clinical or commercial scale, and have no manufacturing facility. As a result, we are dependent on third parties for the manufacture of our requirements and management of our supply chain. If we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the manufacturing of our products, including KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, or our other product development candidates, could be delayed.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of KERYDIN or crisaborole. We have only a small number of personnel with experience in drug product manufacturing. Pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with Hovione, we are obligated during the term of the agreement to purchase from Hovione a portion of our API requirements for KERYDIN intended for distribution in the United States. In addition, pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with DPT, we outsource to DPT the manufacturing and packaging of KERYDIN finished drug product. Any inability by our third-party manufacturers to supply sufficient quantities of KERYDIN API or finished drug product could adversely affect product commercialization and delay certain payments under the Sandoz Agreement. In addition, we currently outsource all API and finished drug product manufacturing and packaging for our product development candidates such as crisaborole to third parties and intend to continue to do so. We may be unable to enter into agreements for commercial supply with third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. We currently rely on Hovione and DPT for our requirements of API and finished drug product for KERYDIN, respectively. In the event that we and our suppliers are unable to agree to terms and conditions for the supply of some or all of our clinical and commercial supply needs of API and finished drug product, our suppliers terminate our agreements or we are unable to renew or continue on terms acceptable to us, or at all, existing agreements with such suppliers following the expiration of their terms, we would not be able to\nmanufacture API and finished drug product until alternative suppliers are identified and qualified. This inability to manufacture could delay the further development of, and impair our ability to commercialize, KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, and our other product development candidates. In addition, in the case of KERYDIN, it could delay certain payments under the Sandoz Agreement. For example, the initial term of our manufacturing agreement with Hovione expires on December 31, 2020, subject to customary early termination rights. Similarly, the initial term of our manufacturing agreement with DPT currently expires on December 31, 2019, subject to customary early termination rights. We may not be able to establish additional sources of supply for our products. Our suppliers are subject to regulatory requirements covering manufacturing, testing, quality control, distribution and record keeping relating to our products and product development candidates, as well as for products and product development candidates owned by other companies. These suppliers are also subject to ongoing inspections by various regulatory agencies, including the FDA. Failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in long delays and interruptions to our product or product development candidate supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our API, product development candidate and product requirements ourselves, including:\n\u2022 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by such third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022 the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by such third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities;\n\u2022 the potential that such third parties will encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control and quality assurance, which could result in their inability to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet our commercial or clinical API, product development candidate or product requirements;\n\u2022 the potential failure by such third parties to establish and follow FDA-mandated cGMP or the failure to document their adherence to cGMP, either of which could require costly recalls of approved products, lead to significant delays in the availability of material for commercial or clinical study needs or delay or prevent marketing approval for our product development candidates;\n\u2022 the potential failure by such third parties to consistently produce quality batches in accordance with the current manufacturing process. If modifications are required to the manufacturing processes or facilities, approval of a new or supplemental NDA may be required; and\n\u2022 the potential that such third parties may encounter financial difficulties that would interfere with their obligations to supply our API, product development candidate or product requirements.\nIn addition, the manufacturing facilities of certain of our suppliers, including Hovione, are located outside of the United States. This may give rise to difficulties in importing our products or product development candidates or their components into the United States or other countries as a result of, among other things, regulatory agency import inspections, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging.\nAny of these factors could result in significant delays or higher costs in connection with our clinical studies, regulatory submissions, regulatory approvals or the commercialization of our products, or loss of market share due to inability to meet demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party collaborations and research agreements to fund all or a portion of certain of our development opportunities and expect to continue to expend resources in our current collaborations and/or research agreements. These research collaborations may fail to successfully identify product development candidates, may result in disputes or our partners may elect not to license, develop or commercialize any of the resulting compounds. In the event that any collaborator of ours does not elect to exercise its option or elects not to develop or commercialize our collaboration product development candidates, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrently, we have one significant ongoing collaboration and research agreement: a research collaboration with the Gates Foundation to discover drug candidates intended to treat two filarial worm diseases (onchocerciasis, or river blindness, and lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis), TB and a parasitic disease (cryptosporidiosis). In addition, while the research period under the GSK Agreement has expired, GSK selected a compound that resulted from the TB program in September 2013, subsequently selected a number of back-up compounds and is responsible for all further development and commercialization with respect thereto. Similarly, while the research term under the Lilly Agreement ended in April 2014, Lilly licensed a development compound for an animal health indication from us in December 2012 and will be responsible for all further development and commercialization of this compound.\nDuring the research terms of the collaborations and research agreements, we and, in some cases, our partner are committed to use diligent efforts to discover and develop compounds and to provide specified resources, on a project-by-project basis. We are either reimbursed for our research costs, or each party is responsible for its own research costs, but in all cases we expect to continue to expend resources on the collaborations and research agreements. If we fail to successfully identify product development candidates or, in some cases, demonstrate proof-of-concept for those product development candidates we identify, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, we may mutually agree with our collaboration partner not to pursue all of the research activities contemplated under the applicable agreement, or our partner may decide not to fund additional research once the term of the applicable agreement ends. For example, in November 2015, DTRA informed us that it would not exercise its remaining option to fund research under our DTRA research agreement for a subsequent extension period. Certain collaboration partners have the option, but are not required, to exclusively license or select for further development certain product development candidates under the agreement once the product development candidate meets specified criteria, subject to continuing obligations to make milestone payments and royalty payments on commercial sales, if any, of such licensed compounds. Certain collaboration partners are obligated to make payments to us upon the achievement of certain initial discovery and developmental milestones, but further, more significant milestone payments are payable only on compounds that the partner chooses to license or develop. If we devote significant resources to a research project and our collaboration partner elects not to exercise its option with respect to any resulting product development candidates or elects not to develop such candidates, our financial condition could be adversely affected. In certain cases, if our partner does not exercise a given option or terminates development, we may request a license to develop and commercialize products containing the relevant compounds. If we make such a request, we may be obligated to make certain milestone and royalty payments to the partner upon development and commercialization of such products.\nIf our collaboration partner elects to license or develop a compound, like GSK and Lilly have, the partner assumes sole responsibility for further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of such compound. Thus, with respect to compounds that our partner chooses to develop, the timing of development and future payments to us, including milestone and royalty payments, will depend on the extent to which such licensed compounds advance through development, regulatory approval and commercialization by our partner. Additionally, our partner can choose to terminate the agreement with a specified notice period or its license to any compounds at any time with no further obligation to\ndevelop and commercialize such compounds. In such event, we would not be eligible to receive further payments for the affected compounds. We would retain rights to develop and market any such product development candidates. However, we would be required to fund further development and commercialization ourselves or with other partners if we continue to pursue these product development candidates and, in some cases, would owe our previous partner royalties if we succeeded in commercializing any such product development candidates. For example, in September 2013, Lilly notified us that it was ceasing further development of the compound licensed in August 2011 for an animal health indication. There can be no assurance that our partners will not terminate product development candidates remaining under license in our existing collaboration agreements.\nIf our partner does not devote sufficient resources to the research, development and commercialization of compounds identified through our research collaboration, or is ineffective in doing so, our operating results could be adversely affected. If our partner independently develops products that compete with our compounds, it could elect to advance such products and not develop or commercialize our product development candidates, even while complying with applicable exclusivity provisions. Our collaboration partners may not fulfill their obligations under the agreements or develop and commercialize compounds identified by the research collaborations. If our partners fail to fulfill their obligations under the agreements or terminate the agreements, we may need to obtain the capital necessary to fund the development and commercialization of the returned compounds, enter into alternative arrangements with a third party or halt our development efforts in these areas. We also could become involved in disputes with our partners, which could lead to delays in or termination of the research collaborations or the development and commercialization of identified product development candidates and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. For example, we settled in October 2013 our breach of contract dispute and all related existing and future claims with Valeant who paid us $142.5 million following an expensive and time-consuming litigation process. We may have other disputes in the future with our current or future partners with respect to our collaboration agreements. If our partners terminate or breach their agreements with us or otherwise do not advance the compounds identified by our research collaborations, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing such compounds could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, which could adversely affect our ability to develop certain of our product development candidates and our financial condition and operating results.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products is expensive. Consequently, we routinely evaluate the establishment of collaborations for development and commercialization of product development candidates and research programs. For example, in July 2014, we entered into the Sandoz Agreement, pursuant to which PharmaDerm, the branded dermatology division of Sandoz, distributes and commercializes KERYDIN in the United States. We also intend to continue to evaluate how best to commercialize crisaborole, if approved, and our other future approved products, if any, in the United States and internationally, and may choose to collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing capabilities and established distribution systems, either to augment our own capabilities or in lieu thereof. If we are unable to enter into any such arrangements with third parties on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to market and sell our products. We expect to face competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements such as our arrangement with Sandoz are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement and they may require substantial resources to maintain. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements for the development of our product development candidates. When we partner with a third party for development and commercialization of a product or product development candidate, we can expect to relinquish to the third party some or all of the control over the future success of that product or product development candidate. Our\ncollaboration partner may not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our products or product development candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization. The terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not be favorable to us. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may be unsuccessful in the commercialization and development of our products or product development candidates. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing preclinical and initial clinical development of a partnered product development candidate or research program, and the payment we receive from our collaboration partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators for our products or product development candidates, we may incur increased costs, we may be forced to limit the number of products or product development candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize them and we might fail to commercialize products or programs or territories for which a suitable collaborator cannot be found. If we fail to achieve successful collaborations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on third-party contractors for a substantial portion of our operations and may not be able to control their work as effectively as if we performed these functions ourselves.\nWe outsource substantial portions of our operations to third-party service providers, including chemical synthesis, biological screening and manufacturing and the conduct of our clinical and preclinical studies, as well as certain medical affairs activities. In addition, under the Sandoz Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States, as well as certain governmental reporting obligations associated therewith. While we do not currently have an internal or contract commercial sales force or commercial infrastructure sufficient to support the potential launch of our product development candidates, we currently expect to establish such capabilities in preparation for the potential approval and launch of crisaborole in the United States. As a result, we may outsource substantial portions of our commercialization activities to third parties, including contract sales organizations, advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services.\nBecause we have relied on third parties, unless and until we establish our own internal infrastructure, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner, may become troubled financially or may fail to perform at all. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to provide us with timely and accurate information or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, it could impact our ability to comply with applicable state and federal laws, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business. In addition, our agreements with third parties with which we do business often contain indemnification provisions pursuant to which we may agree to indemnify the party against certain types of third-party claims. To the extent that we are subject to a claim under such an indemnification provision, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. There are a limited number of third-party service providers that have the expertise required to achieve our business objectives. Identifying, qualifying and managing the performance of third-party service providers can be difficult and time consuming and could cause delays in our development programs. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party service providers. To the extent we are unable to identify, retain and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we lose our relationships with contract research organizations, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe are substantially dependent on third-party vendors and contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies related to our drug discovery and development efforts. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with any one or more of these providers, we could experience a significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its services, which could adversely affect our development efforts. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we locate an alternative provider, it is likely that such a provider will need additional time to respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. In addition, any contract research organization that we retain will be subject to the FDA's regulatory requirements and similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers, the commercialization and development of our products or product development candidates could be delayed, which could severely harm our business and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trademark and trade secret protection covering our products and product development candidates, as well as our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products is dependent upon the extent to which we have regulatory exclusivity or intellectual property based exclusivity rights under valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property that cover our products. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our products, using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions, and the legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of pharmaceutical patents are evolving. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be enforced in the patents that we currently own or that may be issued from the applications we have filed or may file in the future or that we may license from third parties. Additionally, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any term extensions that we seek may not be granted. Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology or prevent third parties from marketing products that are similar or identical to ours.\nThere have been numerous changes to the patent laws that may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. In September 2011, the America Invents Act was signed into law. The final substantive provisions of the America Invents Act became effective in March 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law that affect the way patent applications are filed, prosecuted and litigated, including, among other things, changing from a \"first to invent\" to a \"first inventor to file\" system and creating processes, such as IPR and other post-grant review processes, that permit third parties to challenge the patentability of granted patents before the PTAB. The IPR process, for example, permits any person to\nchallenge the validity of a patent on the grounds that it was anticipated or made obvious by prior art. For a discussion of the IPR proceedings related to our KERYDIN Orange Book Patents, see Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022 others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our products or product development candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022 we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our patents or pending patent applications;\n\u2022 we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022 others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022 any patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or exclusivity in a particular product area;\n\u2022 we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022 the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were the owner of record, either solely or with a collaborator, of numerous issued U.S. patents and non-U.S. patents with claims to composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use or methods of manufacture in various indications. In addition, we regularly pursue, either solely or with a collaborator, additional U.S. patent applications, international (PCT) patent applications and non-U.S. patent applications in various jurisdictions.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Our patent applications would not prevent others from taking advantage of the chemical properties of boron to discover and develop new therapies, including therapies for the indications we are targeting. If others seek to develop boron-based therapies, their research and development efforts may inhibit our ability to conduct research in certain areas and to expand our intellectual property portfolio.\nWe currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in the United States and other countries, which may be subject to government or third-party objections that could prevent the issuance or maintenance of the applications or registrations. In addition, from time to time, parties may assert trademark or other intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters, lawsuits and other forms of communication. If there is a determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future.\nFurthermore, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation, IPR or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to enforce or protect our rights to, or use, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop another party from using the inventions claimed in any of our current or future patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced against that third party. Under the America Invents Act, a third party may also challenge the validity of our patents with the PTAB, whether or not they are accused of infringing our patents, and certain hedge funds have announced their intention to challenge pharmaceutical patents through the IPR process. These lawsuits and administrative proceedings are expensive, consume time and resources and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel even if we are successful. In addition, there is a risk that the court, or the PTAB, as applicable, will decide that such patents are not valid and that we will not have the right to stop third parties from using the inventions. There is also the risk in the context of a lawsuit that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that such other party's activities do not infringe our rights to such patents.\nFor example, in August 2015, CFAD filed a total of three petitions with the PTAB seeking to institute IPR proceedings to invalidate the KERYDIN Orange Book Patents. In February 2016, the PTAB instituted IPR proceedings on these three petitions. In the IPR proceedings, CFAD will have the opportunity to challenge the validity of the claims in the KERYDIN Orange Book Patents before the PTAB. We expect that the PTAB will issue final decisions concerning the patentability of the claims in the KERYDIN Orange Book Patents within one year after the institution of the IPR proceedings, and either party may file an appeal of such decisions with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We intend to vigorously defend the KERYDIN Orange Book Patents in the IPR proceedings. However, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of such matters. We can offer no assurance as to whether we will be successful in our defense of some or all of the claims of the KERYDIN Orange Book Patents, or will be able to maintain exclusivity following the expiration of the expected U.S. regulatory exclusivity for KERYDIN. If CFAD is successful in the IPR proceedings, our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThird parties may in the future seek FDA approval to market generic versions of our products, including KERYDIN and, if approved, crisaborole, through an ANDA and challenge the patents protecting our products. If we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuits, some or all of our claims in the patents may be held invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed, and generic versions of our products could be launched prior to the expiration of our patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by such third party's patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in such activities, including making our products and product development candidates or selling our products. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. There is a risk that a court could decide that we or our partners are infringing such third party's patents and order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by those patents. In that event, we or our partners may need to halt commercialization of the relevant product. In addition, there is a risk that a court could order us or our partners to pay the third party damages for having violated its patents and we may have indemnification obligations to our commercial partners in such circumstances.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is generally difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity in federal court requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology or first to file an application covering the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications, which could require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in litigation, interference, or other proceedings to determine our rights. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our patent position with respect to such inventions.\nPatents covering the composition of matter of KERYDIN and AN2718 that were owned by others have expired. Our patent applications and patents include or support claims on other aspects of KERYDIN or AN2718, such as pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing. Without composition of matter patent protection, our ability to assert our patents to stop others from using or selling our products may be limited.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. For example, in our legal proceedings with Valeant, we spent considerable resources, including management time, in the proceedings before reaching a settlement agreement with Valeant in October 2013 pursuant to which Valeant paid us $142.5 million to settle all existing and related future claims against Valeant, including claims for damages previously awarded to us pursuant to a prior arbitration ruling, and we agreed to provide Valeant a paid-up, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to all patents that contain claims covering efinaconazole.\nWe do not have exclusive rights to intellectual property we developed under U.S. federally funded research grants and contracts in connection with certain of our neglected diseases initiatives, including our research agreement with the Gates Foundation, and, in the case of those funded research activities, we could ultimately share or lose the rights we do have under certain circumstances.\nSome of our intellectual property rights related to compounds that are not currently in clinical development were initially developed in the course of research funded by the U.S. government. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future products pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. Government rights in certain inventions developed under a government-funded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if they determine that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to\nmeet requirements for public use under federal regulations. The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. In addition, the U.S. government may acquire title in any country in which a patent application is not filed within specified time limits.\nSome of our intellectual property rights related to boron-containing compounds that are currently in clinical development, although not funded by the U.S. government, were developed through collaborations. For example, we receive research funding from DNDi, which requires that we share rights with DNDi. We have a co-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license with DNDi to make, use, import and manufacture products for treatment of HAT, Chagas disease and cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in humans in all countries of the world, specifically excluding Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, China and all countries of North America and Europe (\"DNDi Territory\"). We also grant to DNDi an exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to distribute, including uses by, or on behalf of, a public sector agency, products containing molecules synthesized under the research plan for treatment of HAT, Chagas disease and cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in humans in the DNDi Territory. As a result of these licenses, we are unlikely to realize any revenue in the DNDi Territory for any human therapeutics that we discover for these diseases. In March 2012, DNDi commenced Phase 1 human clinical studies of AN5568 in HAT. The AN5568 Phase 1 clinical study was completed in 2015 and a Phase 2/3 registration study is planned for 2016. The boron-containing compounds being studied in our DNDi collaboration are structurally distinct from our other clinical-stage product development candidates. Currently, none of our existing product development candidates are being considered for use in the DNDi collaboration. Likewise, some of our intellectual property rights related to boron-containing compounds that are not currently in clinical development were developed through a collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture (\"MMV\"). We accept research and development funding from MMV, and we provide MMV with a worldwide, royalty-free non-exclusive license (without the right to sublicense, except with our prior written approval) to intellectual property rights arising under the collaboration to develop human therapeutics for the treatment of malaria under our research and development agreements with MMV. The boron-containing compounds being researched under our MMV collaboration are currently structurally distinct from our clinical-stage product development candidates and none of our existing clinical-stage product development candidates are being considered for use in the MMV collaboration.\nUnder our Gates Foundation research agreement, our research efforts with respect to project compounds in neglected diseases and Gates Foundation priority areas in identified developing countries are subject to the co-ownership or exclusive exploitation rights of the Gates Foundation. While we have a first right to develop and commercialize those project compounds, we are required to implement a global access program for such compounds and we may not be able to further develop or exploit project compounds identified in the collaboration.\nWe do not have exclusive rights to certain intellectual property as our rights to certain patents and molecules in our collaborations are jointly owned with our collaborators.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we jointly owned a small number of U.S. patents and patent applications and non-U.S. patent applications with certain of our collaborators. The rights of our collaborators to these patents, patent applications and other compounds under the collaborations may in the future restrict our ability to further develop or generate revenues from those compounds except through the collaborations.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe may need to expand certain of our operations and increase the size of our company, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs we advance our product development candidates to the commercialization stage and increase the number of product development programs we have underway, we may need to increase our marketing, sales, product development, scientific, regulatory and administrative headcount to support these efforts. For example, while we do not currently have an internal or contract commercial sales force or commercial infrastructure sufficient to support the potential launch of our product development candidates, we currently expect to establish such capabilities in preparation for the potential approval and launch of crisaborole in the United States. In order to commercialize crisaborole, if approved, we must build our marketing, sales, distribution, management and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support our future growth. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects may require that we:\n\u2022 successfully attract and recruit new employees with the expertise and experience we will require;\n\u2022 develop a marketing, sales and distribution capability;\n\u2022 manage our clinical programs effectively, which we anticipate being conducted at numerous clinical sites; and\n\u2022 continue to develop our compliance, operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage this growth, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management, sales and marketing, finance, scientific, clinical, legal, regulatory and administrative personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We are highly dependent on the development, regulatory, commercialization and business development expertise of our executive officers and key employees. If we lose one or more of our executive officers or key employees, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed. We have entered into change of control and severance agreements with each of our executive officers as part of our retention efforts. Replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, motivate or retain these additional key personnel. Our failure to retain key personnel could materially harm our business.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which may adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nWe operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with, among others, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will have been detected. If we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth.\nOther Risks Relating to Our Business\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability with respect to our approved products and product development candidates and may have to limit or terminate the commercialization or development of such products.\nThe sale of our approved products, including KERYDIN, and the use of our product development candidates, including crisaborole, in clinical studies expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against us or our partners by patients, participants enrolled in our clinical studies, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 recall of products;\n\u2022 decreased demand for our products or product development candidates and loss of revenues;\n\u2022 our inability to commercialize our products;\n\u2022 substantial litigation costs;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u2022 termination of clinical study sites or entire study programs;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022 impairment of our business reputation; and\n\u2022 diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for the commercial sale of our products, including KERYDIN and, if approved, crisaborole. In addition, we have obtained limited\nproduct liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies domestically and in selected foreign countries where we have conducted clinical studies. Our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on the unanticipated side effects of drug products. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially adversely affect our business.\nOur operations involve hazardous materials, which could subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals. While we rely on our third-party manufacturers for our clinical and commercial product requirements, our operations, including our research and development operations, may produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to civil damages in the event of exposure of individuals to hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use of these materials and our liability may exceed our total assets. We maintain general liability insurance in the normal course of our business based on our consultation with our insurance consultants, and in light of current market conditions, including cost and availability. However, such coverage may not be adequate to cover claims related to our biological or hazardous materials. Furthermore, if we were to be held liable for a claim involving our biological or hazardous materials, this liability could exceed our insurance coverage, if any, and our other financial resources. Compliance with environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations may be expensive and current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. For example, we do not carry earthquake insurance. In the event of a major earthquake in our region, our business could suffer significant and uninsured damage and loss. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, auto, workers' compensation, products liability and directors' and officers' insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could materially adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and\ncomplexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, and the volume of data we retain, make such systems potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, security breaches and other cyber-attacks. From time to time, our systems have been subject to cyber-attacks. A security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to personally identifiable information or other protected information could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. If we are unable to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of data security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile and could decline significantly.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 the successful commercialization of KERYDIN pursuant to the Sandoz Agreement;\n\u2022 problems in our manufacturing or supply chain that limit or exhaust the quantity of supplies of KERYDIN, crisaborole, if approved, or other future approved products, if any, that are available to patients;\n\u2022 announcement of FDA approval or non-approval of crisaborole or our other product development candidates, the content of approved labeling for our product development candidates and the timing of the FDA review process;\n\u2022 the timely and successful launch of crisaborole, if approved;\n\u2022 actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to products or drug classes related to KERYDIN, crisaborole or our other product development candidates;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 any issues, delays or failures arising as a result of our clinical studies relating to our product development candidates, including crisaborole;\n\u2022 results of clinical studies conducted by our competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors' products;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our or our competitors' operating results or changes in our or their product sales growth rates;\n\u2022 competition from existing products or new products;\n\u2022 announcements by us, our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022 issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 litigation or other proceedings, such as the IPR proceedings related to our KERYDIN Orange Book Patents, and our ability to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for our intellectual property;\n\u2022 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u2022 market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general; and\n\u2022 general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. You may not realize any return on an investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nOwnership in our common stock is concentrated. Our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock together beneficially own a significant percentage of our common stock based on reports filed with the SEC. If these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combination or reorganization, as well as our management and affairs. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other stockholders may desire. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nFuture issuances of our common stock, or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, may cause dilution to existing stockholders and may cause our share price to decline.\nWe may raise additional funds through the issuance and sale of additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. For example, in October 2014, we issued and sold $90.5 million of Convertible Senior Notes. Pursuant to the indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at their option during any fiscal quarter commencing after December 31, 2014, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is\ngreater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day. During the year ended December 31, 2015, $0.3 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes was converted at the election of the holders thereof, and we elected to settle such conversions by delivery of shares of our common stock and issued an aggregate of 11,239 shares in connection therewith. Conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders to the extent that we elect to deliver shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock) in connection therewith. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes could depress the price of our common stock. We may also issue shares of common stock, stock options, RSUs or other stock-based awards under our existing or future equity incentive plans, employee stock purchase plans or other employee or director compensation plans. The issuance of additional shares of common stock (including pursuant to conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes) or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, or the perception that such issuances may occur, may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention from other business concerns, which could materially harm our business.\nCertain holders of the Convertible Senior Notes have demand registration rights, which could require us to register such securities for public sale at the holders' option.\nIn connection with the sale of $8.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes (the \"Venrock Notes\") in October 2014 to certain funds affiliated with Venrock Associates (the \"Venrock Funds\"), an affiliate of ours, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the Venrock Funds. Pursuant to such registration rights agreement, the Venrock Funds may require us, from and after the one-year anniversary of the last date of original issuance of the Venrock Notes, to register the resale by the Venrock Funds of the Venrock Notes, any shares of our common stock issuable to the Venrock Funds upon conversion of the Venrock Notes or any other securities that may be issued or distributed in respect of such Venrock Notes or shares by way of conversion, dividend, stock split or other distribution or specified corporate transactions.\nAs a public company, we are subject to additional expenses and administrative burden.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses and our administrative staff is required to perform additional tasks, such as adopting additional internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, retaining a transfer agent and bearing all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, may create uncertainty for public companies, increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. We evaluate and monitor these rules and proposed changes to rules on an on- going basis, but cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and such investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and may divert management's time and attention from other activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. In the future, it may be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law, and certain provisions of the Convertible Senior Notes, could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us, with some exceptions, from engaging in mergers, asset or stock sales or other business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Finally, our charter documents establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nIn addition, certain provisions of the Convertible Senior Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if an acquisition event constitutes a \"fundamental change\" under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Convertible Senior Notes for cash. Similarly, if an acquisition event constitutes a \"make-whole fundamental change\" under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change.", "PERMNO": 12392, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ANAC"}
