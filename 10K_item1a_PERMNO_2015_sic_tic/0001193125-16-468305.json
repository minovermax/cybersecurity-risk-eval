{"cik": "1320695", "company": "TreeHouse Foods, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company also may impair the Company\u2019s business operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to fund acquisitions or to renew our outstanding credit agreements upon expiration on commercially reasonable terms.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $1,244.5 million of outstanding indebtedness, excluding $7.9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, which included $353.0 million outstanding under our $900 million Revolving Credit Facility that matures May 6, 2019, a $295.5 million senior unsecured term loan (\u201cTerm Loan A\u201d) maturing on May 6, 2021, a $190.0 million senior unsecured term loan (\u201cTerm Loan A-1\u201d) that matures on May 6, 2019, $400.0 million of 4.875% notes due March 15, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Notes\u201d), and $6.0 million of tax increment financing, capital lease obligations, and other debt. The inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the inability to access additional borrowing at commercially reasonable terms could affect our ability to pursue additional acquisitions. United States capital credit markets have experienced volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions that caused tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding. Capital and credit markets and the U.S. and global economies could be affected by additional volatility or economic downturns in the future. Events affecting the credit markets could have an adverse effect on other financial markets in the United States, which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities. There can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets, or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business and could possibly increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the aggregate principal amount of our debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $838.5 million, based on the outstanding debt balance of our Credit Agreement. As a result, higher interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk, and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. In December 2015, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it would gradually raise short-term interest rates over the next three years. As of December 31, 2015, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $8.4 million change in the annual cash interest expense, before any principal payment, on our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk.\nFluctuations in foreign currencies may adversely affect earnings.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company\u2019s Canadian subsidiaries purchase various inputs that are based in U.S. dollars, accordingly, the profitability of the Canadian subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses that affect earnings. We manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to raw material purchases using foreign currency contracts. We are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of our foreign currency investment in our Canadian subsidiaries, which includes Canadian dollar denominated intercompany notes. We translate the Canadian assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Accordingly, we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings due to fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nAs we are dependent upon a limited number of customers, the loss of a significant customer, or consolidation of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results.\nA limited number of customers represent a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. Our operating results are contingent on our ability to maintain our sales to these customers. The competition to supply products to these high volume customers is very strong. We expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to arise from a small number of customers, consisting primarily of traditional grocery retailers, mass merchandisers, and foodservice operators. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 55.2% of our consolidated net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20.7%, 18.8%, and 19.0%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales. These customers typically do not enter into written contracts, and the contracts that they do enter into generally are terminable at will. Our customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, and customer service performance. If our product sales to one or more of these customers decline, this reduction may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, over the past several years, the retail grocery and foodservice industries have experienced a consolidation trend, which has resulted in mass merchandisers and non-traditional grocers gaining market share. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer large customers. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing or increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, product innovation, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if the surviving entity of a consolidation or similar transaction is not a current customer of the Company, we may lose significant business once held with the acquired retailer.\nIncreases in input costs, such as ingredients, packaging materials, and fuel costs, could adversely affect earnings.\nThe costs of raw materials, packaging materials, and fuel have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly. While individual input cost changes varied throughout the year, with certain costs increasing and others decreasing, input costs were slightly favorable in 2015 compared to 2014. We expect the volatile nature of these costs to continue with an overall long-term upward trend.\nWe manage the impact of increases in the costs of raw materials, wherever possible, by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our production requirements. The price of oil has been particularly volatile recently and there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will result in the optimal price. In addition, we attempt to offset the effect of such increases by raising prices to our customers. However, changes in the prices of our products may lag behind changes in the costs of our materials. Competitive pressures may also limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to increased raw materials, packaging, and fuel costs. Accordingly, if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increasing raw material, packaging, and fuel costs, our operating profits and margins could be materially affected. In addition, in instances of declining input costs, customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs.\nOur private label and regionally branded products may not be able to compete successfully with nationally branded products.\nFor sales of private label products to retailers, the principal competitive factors are price, product quality, and quality of service. For sales of private label products to consumers, the principal competitive factors are price and product quality. In many cases, competitors with nationally branded products have a competitive advantage over\nprivate label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label producers becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant.\nCompetition to obtain shelf space for our branded products with retailers is primarily based on the expected or historical performance of our product sales relative to our competitors. The principal competitive factors for sales of our branded products to consumers are brand recognition and loyalty, product quality, promotion, and price. Most of our branded competitors have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do.\nCompetitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose sales, which may require us to lower prices, increase the use of discounting or promotional programs, or increase marketing expenditures, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability.\nWe operate in the highly competitive food industry.\nWe face competition across our product lines from other companies that have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions. Some of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and competition with them in our various business segments and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Category sales and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products.\nSome customer buying decisions are based on a periodic bidding process in which the successful bidder is assured the selling of its selected product to the food retailer, super center, mass merchandiser, or foodservice distributors, until the next bidding process. Our sales volume may decrease significantly if our offer is too high and we lose the ability to sell products through these channels, even temporarily. Alternatively, we risk reducing our margins if our offer is successful but below our desired price point. Either of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, competition can impact our ability to pass on increased costs or otherwise increase prices.\nOur indebtedness and our ability to pay could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Private Brands Business, we incurred a significant amount of debt and may incur additional debt in the future. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments\u201d and Note 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described herein would increase. The degree to which we are leveraged could have adverse consequences to us, limiting management\u2019s choices in responding to business, economic, regulatory and other competitive conditions. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy\nour debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nConsistent with our stated strategy, our future growth depends, in large part, on our acquisition of additional food manufacturing businesses, products or processes. We may be unable to identify suitable targets, opportunistic or otherwise, for acquisition or make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms.\nAcquisitions involve risks, including those associated with integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate technologies, and personnel of acquired companies; managing geographically dispersed operations; the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; unknown risks; and the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies. We may not successfully integrate businesses or technologies we acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations due to, among other things, the incurrence of debt, onetime write-offs of goodwill, and amortization expenses of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.\nWe may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, which may result in decreased demand for our products.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and overall purchasing trends of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. Consumer preferences change from time to time, and our failure to anticipate, identify, or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which would adversely affect our operating results and profitability.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims for misbranded, adulterated, contaminated or spoiled food products.\nWe sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, misbranding, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of a misbranded, adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury. We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverage. Even if product liability claims against us are not successful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly and time consuming, and may require management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business. A product that has been actually or allegedly misbranded or becomes adulterated could result in product withdrawals, product recalls, destruction of product inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Any of these events, including a significant product liability judgment against us, could result in a loss of confidence in our food products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNew laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe food industry is subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to food safety, food labeling, and environmental matters. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, healthcare costs, energy usage, international trade, immigration, and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers. Changes in these laws or regulations, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, could increase the costs of doing business for the\nCompany, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nIncreased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience, and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, system failures, security breaches, cyber security attacks, and viruses. If we are unable to prevent security breaches, we may suffer business disruption, theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel, customer, or otherwise confidential information. Such unauthorized disclosure of information may lead to financial or reputational damage or penalties, which could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, or lead to claims against the Company or governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability and ultimately harm our business. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed, or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business or cause us to incur additional legal fees and costs. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nChanges in weather conditions, natural disasters, and other events beyond our control could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in weather conditions, climate changes, and natural disasters such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, or pestilence, may affect the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials. Additionally, these events could result in reduced supplies of raw materials. Our competitors may be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their suppliers and operations. Further, changes in weather could impact consumer demand and our earnings may be affected by seasonal factors including the seasonality of our supplies and such changes in consumer demand. Damage or disruption to our production or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nDisruption of our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to manufacture, move, and sell products is critical to our success. We are subject to damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities (in particular, to the extent\nthat our raw materials are sourced globally) due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, adverse changes in political conditions or political unrest, pandemic, strikes, import restrictions, or other factors that could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nOur business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages by our employees.\nCurrently, collective bargaining agreements cover a significant number of our full-time distribution, production, and maintenance employees. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could result in production interruptions caused by work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our results of operations could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 90775, "SIC": 2030, "TIC": "THS"}
