{"cik": "24491", "company": "COOPER TIRE & RUBBER CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSome of the more significant risk factors related to the Company and its subsidiaries follow:\nPricing volatility for raw materials or commodities or an inadequate supply of key raw materials could result in increased costs and may significantly affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe pricing volatility for natural rubber, petroleum-based materials and other raw materials contributes to the difficulty in managing the costs of raw materials. Costs for certain raw materials used in the Company\u2019s operations, including natural rubber, chemicals, carbon black, steel reinforcements and synthetic rubber remain highly volatile. Increasing costs for raw material supplies will increase the Company\u2019s production costs and affect its margins if the Company is unable to pass the higher production costs on to its customers in the form of price increases. Decreasing costs for raw materials could also affect margins if the Company is unable to maintain its pricing structure by offering price reductions to remain competitive. Further, if the Company is unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner for any reason, its operations could be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected.\n- 5 -\nThe Company is facing heightened risks due to the current business environment.\nCurrent global economic conditions may affect demand for the Company\u2019s products, create volatility in raw material costs and affect the availability and cost of credit. These conditions also affect the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers as well as the ultimate consumer.\nDeterioration in the global macroeconomic environment or in specific regions could impact the Company and, depending upon the severity and duration of these factors, the Company\u2019s profitability and liquidity position could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may also change their actions as a result of changes to the business environment, which could result in increased price competition and discounts, resulting in lower margins for the business.\nThe Company\u2019s results could be impacted by changes in tariffs imposed by the U.S. or other governments on imported tires.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to competitively source and sell tires can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs imposed by various governments. Other effects, including impacts on the price of tires, responsive actions from other governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where the Company participates, could also have significant impacts on the Company\u2019s results.\nAntidumping and countervailing duty investigations into certain passenger car and light truck tires imported from the PRC into the United States were initiated on July 14, 2014. The preliminary determinations announced in both investigations were affirmative and resulted in the imposition of additional duties from each. It is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of these investigations and what impact they will have on the Company. Final determinations in these investigations are expected during the third quarter of 2015.\nThe Company is facing supply risks related to certain tires it purchases from CCT.\nIn 2014, the Company sold its ownership interest in CCT and entered into off-take agreements with CCT to provide the continuous supply of certain CCT-produced tires for the Company. If there are any disruptions in or quality issues with the supply of Cooper-branded products, it could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Company could be required to find an alternative source for CCT-produced tires and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in a timely manner. CCT is currently the sole supplier of medium truck tires for the Company\nThe Company may fail to successfully develop or implement information technologies or related systems, resulting in a significant competitive disadvantage.\nSuccessfully competing in the highly competitive tire industry can be impacted by the successful development of information technology. If the Company fails to successfully implement information technology systems, it may be at a disadvantage to its competitors resulting in lost sales and negative impacts on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company has implemented an Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system in the United States and is continuing to implement the system globally, which will require significant amounts of capital and human resources to deploy. These requirements may exceed the Company\u2019s projections. If for any reason this implementation is not successful, the Company could be required to expense rather than capitalize related amounts. Throughout implementation of the system there are also risks created to the Company\u2019s ability to successfully and efficiently operate.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive, and the Company may not be able to compete effectively with lower-cost producers and larger competitors.\nThe replacement tire industry is a highly competitive, global industry. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources. Most of the Company\u2019s competitors have operations in lower-cost countries. Intense competitive activity in the replacement tire industry has caused, and will continue to cause, pressures on the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend in part on its ability to balance capacity with demand, leverage global purchasing of raw materials, make required investments to improve productivity, eliminate redundancies and increase production at low-cost, high-quality supply sources. If the Company is unable to offset continued pressures with improved operating efficiencies, its sales, margins, operating results and market share would decline and the impact could become material on the Company\u2019s earnings.\n- 6 -\nThe Company may be adversely affected by legal actions, including products liability claims which, if successful, could have a negative impact on its financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations expose it to legal actions, including potential liability for personal injury or death as an alleged result of the failure of or conditions in the products that it designs, manufactures and sells. Specifically, the Company is a party to a number of products liability cases in which individuals involved in motor vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires that it manufactured. Products liability claims and lawsuits, including possible class action, may result in material losses in the future and cause the Company to incur significant litigation defense costs. The Company is largely self-insured against these claims. These claims could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company is also subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal proceedings relating to its business, including purported class action lawsuits, derivative lawsuits and other litigation related to the now terminated merger agreement with the Apollo entities. Due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. An unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s expenditures for pension and other postretirement obligations could be materially higher than it has predicted if its underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nThe Company provides defined benefit and hybrid pension plan coverage to union and non-union U.S. employees and a contributory defined benefit plan in the U.K. The Company\u2019s pension expense and its required contributions to its pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions the Company uses to measure its defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value and the inflation rate. The Company could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of its pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate, changes in its assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets and updates to mortality tables. The Company could also experience increased other postretirement expense due to decreases in the discount rate, increases in the health care trend rate and changes in the health care environment.\nIn the event of declines in the market value of the Company\u2019s pension assets or lower discount rates to measure the present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, the Company could experience changes to its Consolidated Balance Sheet or significant cash requirements.\nCompliance with regulatory initiatives could increase the cost of operating the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Compliance with those laws now in effect, or that may be enacted, could require significant capital expenditures, increase the Company\u2019s production costs and affect its earnings and results of operations.\nSeveral countries have or may implement labeling requirements for tires. This legislation could cause the Company\u2019s products to be at a disadvantage in the marketplace resulting in a loss of market share or could otherwise impact the Company\u2019s ability to distribute and sell its tires.\nIn addition, while the Company believes that its tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of the Company\u2019s tires could occur in the future. A recall could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, operating results and financial position.\nThe Company is also subject to legislation governing labor occupational safety and health both in the U.S. and other countries. The related legislation can change over time making it more expensive for the Company to produce its products. The Company could also, despite its best efforts to comply with these laws, be found liable and be subject to additional costs because of this legislation.\nThe Company has a risk due to volatility of the capital and financial markets.\nThe Company periodically requires access to the capital and financial markets as a significant source of liquidity for maturing debt payments or working capital needs that it cannot satisfy by cash on hand or operating cash flows. Substantial volatility in world capital markets and the banking industry may make it difficult for the Company to access credit markets and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, various additional factors, including a deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit ratings or its business or financial condition, could further impair its access to the capital markets. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets, including the ability to refinance existing debt when due, could require the Company to defer critical capital expenditures, reduce or not pay dividends, reduce spending in areas of strategic importance, sell important assets or, in extreme cases, seek protection from creditors. See also related comments under \u201cThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s global strategy which includes using joint ventures and partially-owned subsidiaries.\u201d\n- 7 -\nThe Company\u2019s operations in the PRC have been financed in part using multiple loans from several lenders to finance facility construction, expansions and working capital needs. These loans are generally for terms of three years or less. Therefore, debt maturities occur frequently and access to the capital markets is crucial to their ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to support their operations.\nThe Company conducts its manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and is subject to risks associated with doing business outside the U.S.\nThe Company has affiliate, subsidiary and joint venture operations worldwide, including in the U.S., the U.K., Europe, Mexico and the PRC. The Company has one manufacturing entity, Cooper Kunshan, in the PRC. The Company also is the majority owner of COOCSA, a manufacturing entity in Mexico, and has established an operation in Serbia. In 2014, the Company sold its ownership interest in CCT and entered into off-take agreements with CCT to continue supplying tires to the Company. CCT is currently the sole supplier of medium truck tires for the Company. There are a number of risks in doing business abroad, including political and economic uncertainty, social unrest, sudden changes in laws and regulations, shortages of trained labor and the uncertainties associated with entering into joint ventures or similar arrangements in foreign countries. These risks may impact the Company\u2019s ability to expand its operations in different regions and otherwise achieve its objectives relating to its foreign operations, including utilizing these locations as suppliers to other markets. In addition, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, import and export limitations and exchange controls is burdensome and expensive. The Company\u2019s foreign operations also subject it to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities and to foreign currency risks, including exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the repatriation of funds.\nIf the Company fails to develop technologies, processes or products needed to support consumer demand it may lose significant market share or be unable to recover associated costs.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to sell tires may be significantly impacted if it does not develop or have available technologies, processes, or products that competitors may be developing and consumers demanding. This includes but is not limited to changes in the design of and materials used to manufacture tires.\nTechnologies may also be developed by competitors that better distribute tires to consumers, which could affect the Company\u2019s customers.\nAdditionally, developing new products and technologies requires significant investment and capital expenditures, is technologically challenging and requires extensive testing and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. If the Company fails to develop new products that are appealing to its customers, or fails to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, the Company may be unable to recover its product development and testing costs. If the Company cannot successfully use new production or equipment methodologies it invests in, it may also not be able to recover those costs.\nA disruption in, or failure of, the Company\u2019s information technology systems, including those related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations and financial performance.\nThe Company relies on the accuracy, capacity and security of its information technology systems across all of its major business functions, including its research and development, manufacturing, sales, financial and administrative functions. Despite the security measures that the Company has implemented, including those related to cybersecurity, its systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. A system failure, accident or security breach could result in business disruption, theft of its intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions to its operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, its data or confidential information, the Company\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the Company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against and, if required, remediate the damage caused by such disruptions or system failures in the future.\nAny interruption in the Company\u2019s skilled workforce, or that of its suppliers or customers, including labor disruptions, could impair its operations and harm its earnings and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce and any interruption of its workforce due to shortages of skilled technical, production or professional workers, work disruptions, or other events could interrupt the Company\u2019s operations and affect its operating results. Further, a significant number of the Company\u2019s employees are currently represented by unions. If the Company is unable to resolve any labor disputes or if there are work stoppages or other work disruptions at the Company or any of its suppliers or customers, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could suffer. See also related comments under \u201cThe Company is facing supply risks related to certain tires it purchases from CCT.\u201d\n- 8 -\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain key personnel, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the continued service of key members of its management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of its management team could have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company\u2019s future success will also depend on its ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, especially in the PRC, and the Company could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support its business. If the Company does not succeed in retaining its current employees and attracting new high-quality employees, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf assumptions used in developing the Company\u2019s strategic plan are inaccurate or the Company is unable to execute its strategic plan effectively, its profitability and financial position could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company faces both general industry and company-specific challenges. These include volatile raw material costs, increasing product complexity and pressure from competitors with greater resources or manufacturing in lower-cost regions. To address these challenges and position the Company for future success, the Company continues to execute towards strategic imperatives outlined in its Strategic Plan. The three strategic imperatives are building a sustainable cost competitive position, driving top-line profitable growth and building organizational capabilities and enablers to support strategic goals.\nThe Company continually reviews and updates its business plans to achieve these imperatives. If the assumptions used in developing the Company\u2019s business plans vary significantly from actual conditions, the Company\u2019s sales, margins and profitability could be harmed. If the Company is unsuccessful in implementing the tactics necessary to execute its business plans it may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which could impair its ability to meet debt and other obligations and could otherwise negatively affect its operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company may not be successful in executing and integrating acquisitions into its operations, which could harm its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company routinely evaluates potential acquisitions and may pursue acquisition opportunities, some of which could be material to its business. The Company cannot provide assurance whether it will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. The Company may encounter various risks in any acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\nthe possible inability to integrate an acquired business into its operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nloss of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated problems or liabilities; and\n\u2022\nincreased labor and regulatory compliance costs of acquired businesses.\nSome or all of those risks could impair the Company\u2019s results of operations and impact its financial condition. The Company may finance any future acquisitions from internally generated funds, bank borrowings, public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities, or a combination of the foregoing. Acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.\nAcquisitions may also require the Company to increase its borrowings under its bank credit facilities or other debt instruments, or to seek new sources of liquidity. Increased borrowings would correspondingly increase the Company\u2019s financial leverage, and could result in lower credit ratings and increased future borrowing costs. These risks could also reduce the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changes in its industry or in general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s business plans call for growth, particularly in Asia. If the Company is unable to identify or execute on appropriate opportunities for acquisition, investment or growth, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s global strategy which includes using joint ventures and partially-owned subsidiaries.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy includes the use of joint ventures and other partially-owned subsidiaries. These entities operate in countries outside of the U.S., are generally less well capitalized than the Company and bear risks similar to the risks of the Company. In addition, there are specific risks applicable to these subsidiaries and these risks, in turn, add potential risks to the Company. Such risks include greater risk of joint venture partners or other investors failing to meet their obligations under related shareholders\u2019 agreements; conflicts with joint venture partners; the possibility of a joint venture partner taking valuable knowledge from the Company; and risk of being denied access to the capital markets, which could lead to resource demands on the Company in order to maintain or advance its strategy. The Company\u2019s outstanding notes and primary credit facility contain cross default provisions in the event of certain defaults by the Company under other agreements with third parties. For further discussion of access to the capital markets, see also related comments under \u201cThe Company has a risk due to volatility of the capital and financial markets.\u201d\n- 9 -\nIf the price of energy sources increases, the Company\u2019s operating expenses could increase significantly or the demand for the Company\u2019s products could be affected.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities rely principally on natural gas, as well as electrical power and other energy sources. High demand and limited availability of natural gas and other energy sources can result in significant increases in energy costs increasing the Company\u2019s operating expenses and transportation costs. Higher energy costs would increase the Company\u2019s production costs and adversely affect its margins and results of operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate sources of energy, its operations could be interrupted.\nIn addition, if the price of gasoline increases significantly for consumers, it can affect driving and purchasing habits and impact demand for tires.\nThe Company is required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause it to incur significant costs.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and the Company expects that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on it in the future. In addition, the Company has contractual indemnification obligations for environmental remediation costs and liabilities that may arise relating to certain divested operations. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change, if material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered, or if required remediation of known conditions becomes more extensive than expected. If the Company fails to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, it could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could harm its business or results of operations. Environmental laws could also restrict the Company\u2019s ability to expand its facilities or could require it to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with its manufacturing processes.\nThe Company has been and may continue to be impacted by currency fluctuations, which may reduce reported results for our international operations and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nBecause the Company conducts transactions in various non-U.S. currencies, including the Euro, Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Swiss franc, Swedish kronar, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our operating results are subject to the effects of fluctuations in the value of these currencies and fluctuations in the related currency exchange rates. As a result, the Company\u2019s sales have historically been affected by, and may continue to be affected by, these fluctuations. Exchange rate movements between currencies in which the Company sells its products have been affected by and may continue to result in exchange losses that could materially affect results. During times of strength of the U.S. dollar, the reported revenues of the Company\u2019s international operations will be reduced because local currencies will translate into fewer dollars. In addition, a strong U.S. dollar may increase the competitiveness of competitors based outside of the United States. As a result, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights adequately.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part upon its ability to use and protect its proprietary technology and other intellectual property, which generally covers various aspects in the design and manufacture of its products and processes. The Company owns and uses tradenames and trademarks worldwide. The Company relies upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect its intellectual property rights. The steps the Company takes in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter challenges, reverse engineering or infringement or other violations of its intellectual property, and the Company may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce its intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of some countries may not protect and enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Further, while the Company believes it has rights to use all intellectual property in the Company\u2019s use, if the Company is found to infringe on the rights of others it could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company is facing risks relating to enactment of healthcare legislation.\nThe Company is facing risks emanating from the enactment of legislation by the U.S. government including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, which are collectively referred to as healthcare legislation. This major legislation is being implemented over a period of several years and the ultimate cost and the potentially adverse impact to the Company and its employees cannot be quantified at this time.\n- 10 -\nThe impact of proposed new accounting standards may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering several projects which may result in the modification of accounting standards affecting the Company, including standards relating to revenue recognition, financial instruments, leasing, and others. Any such changes could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe realizability of deferred tax assets may affect the Company\u2019s profitability and cash flows.\nThe Company has significant net deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and determines at each reporting period whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary based upon the expected realizability of such deferred tax assets. In the U.S., the Company has recorded deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to products liability, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relates to accelerated depreciation. The Company\u2019s non-U.S. deferred tax assets relate to pension, accrued expenses and net operating losses, and are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities related to accelerated depreciation. Based upon the Company\u2019s assessment of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets, the Company maintains a small valuation allowance for the portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets primarily associated with a capital loss carryforward. In addition, the Company has recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with non-U.S. net operating losses. The Company\u2019s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions regarding future profitability, and potentially adverse business conditions that could have a negative impact on the realizability and therefore impact the Company\u2019s operating results or financial position.", "PERMNO": 27430, "SIC": 3011, "TIC": "CTB"}
