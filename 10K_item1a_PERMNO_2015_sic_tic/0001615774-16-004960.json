{"cik": "1641129", "company": "LookSmart Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the following events described as a company risk factor actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and our investors could lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur financial results are highly concentrated in the online search advertising business; if we are unable to grow online search advertising revenues and find alternative sources of revenue, our financial results will suffer.\nSearch advertising accounted for substantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our success depends upon search advertising customers choosing to use, and distribution network partners choosing to distribute, our search advertising networks products. Decisions by search advertising customers and distribution network partners not to adopt our products at projected rates, or changes in market conditions, may adversely affect the use or distribution of search advertisements. Because of our revenue concentration in the online search advertising business, such shortfalls or changes could have a negative impact on our financial results. Also, many of our products are offered to website publishers who use them to display or generate revenue from their online advertisements. If we are unable to generate significant revenue from our online advertising business or related business models under development, or if market conditions adversely affect the use or distribution of online advertisements generally, or for some of our larger customers specifically, our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity will suffer.\nOur largest category of customers have historically been Intermediaries, the majority of whom purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of large search engine providers. In 2014, we experienced a further decrease in revenues due to loss of Intermediary business.\nWe operate in a large online search advertising ecosystem serving ads that target user queries on partner sites. We operate in the middle of this ecosystem, acquiring search queries from a variety of sources and matching them with the keywords of our search advertising customers. Our largest category of customers has historically been Intermediaries, the majority of which purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of large search engine providers. The Intermediary business model experienced a significant change in the fourth quarter of 2011. Since then, we have seen our revenues from Intermediaries decreasing from prior levels, and have ceased business with a number of our Intermediary customers. We do not expect significant future revenue growth in this area. If we are unable to identify and exploit alternative sources of profitable revenue, our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity will suffer.\nOur future success depends on sales to, and the management of, international customers.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from sales to international customers who are headquartered internationally, however our business with them is primarily U.S. based and our transactions are primarily in U.S. dollars.\nManaging our growing group of customers outside the U.S. presents various challenges, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf economic and political conditions;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;\n\u25cf our ability to develop relationships with local accounts;\n\u25cf compliance with United States and international laws and regulations;\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u25cf our ability to secure and retain qualified people for the operation of our business.\nTo date, foreign exchange exposure from sales has not been material to our operations. Our activities with customers outside the United States may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, which increases the risk of unauthorized use of our technologies. Our business could be materially adversely affected if foreign markets do not continue to develop, if we do not receive additional traffic suitable for our foreign accounts or if regulations governing our international businesses change.\nWe rely primarily on our distribution network partners to generate quality search queries and display advertisements that generate paid clicks; if we are unable to maintain or expand the scope and quality of this network, our ability to generate revenue may be seriously harmed.\nThe success of our online search advertisement products depends in large part on the size and quality of our distribution network of search queries. We may be unable to maintain or add partners of satisfactory quality in our distribution network at reasonable revenue-sharing rates, if at all. If we lose any significant portion of our distribution network, we would need to find alternative sources of quality click traffic to replace the lost paid clicks. In the past, we have lost portions of our distribution network and chose to remove those with poor quality. Although alternate sources of click traffic are currently available in the market, they may not be available at reasonable prices or may be of unacceptable quality. There is significant competition among advertising networks to sign agreements with traffic providers. We may be unable to negotiate and sign agreements with quality traffic providers on favorable terms, if at all. In order to attract higher quality traffic, we may have to pay high traffic acquisition costs which may adversely affect our gross margin and other financial results. If we are unable to attract higher quality traffic, or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in maintaining and expanding our distribution network, then our ability to generate revenue may be seriously harmed.\nWe generated net losses in 2015 and 2014, have had losses in the past, and may have further losses in the future. Failure to maintain operating profitability could harm our business and result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe had a net loss of $3.2 million in 2015 and $6.4 million in 2014. We may be unable to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend on our ability to generate additional revenue and contain our expenses. In order to generate additional revenue, we will need to expand our network of distribution network partners, increase the amount our search advertising customers spend on our advertising network, expand our advertiser base, experience an increase in paid clicks across our network and publisher products and develop and implement successful new digital advertising revenue generating models. We may be unable to accomplish some or any of these goals because of the risks identified in this report or for unforeseen reasons. Also, we may be unable to contain our costs due to the need to make revenue sharing payments to our distribution network partners, to invest in product development and to market our products. Historically, our operating expenses have increased in proportion to our revenue. Operating expenses may increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that our revenue grows and as we increase headcount, particularly our sales and technology-related headcount, incur general and administrative expenses associated with being a public company and expand our facilities. Additionally, our acquisition-related costs may increase if we pursue additional acquisition opportunities. Although we expect to achieve operating efficiencies and greater leverage of resources as we grow, because of the foregoing factors, and others outlined in this report, we may be unable to achieve profitability in the future, which could result in a decline in our stock price.\nIf we experience decreases to our match rate and/or revenue-per-click, or we are unable to rebuild our match rate, and/or revenue-per-click, our financial results may suffer.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience in the future, decreases in our average revenue-per-click (\u201cRPC\u201d) and average match rate, which is the rate at which our paid listings are matched against search queries from distribution network partners. Future decreases in RPC or average match rate may occur for a variety of reasons, including a change in customer mix, the erosion of our advertiser base, a reduction in average advertiser spend, a reduction in the number of listings purchased by search advertising customers, a lower number of bids on keywords, changes in the composition of our distribution network or for other reasons. If our RPC or average match rate falls for any reason, or if we are unable to grow our RPC and average match rate, then we may be unable to achieve our financial projections and our stock price would likely suffer.\nOur growth depends on our ability to retain and grow our search advertising customer base; if our search advertising customer base and average search advertising customer spend falls, our financial results will suffer.\nOur growth depends on our ability to build a search advertising customer base that corresponds with the characteristics of our distribution network. Our distribution network, which currently consists of a diversified set of distribution sources, may change as new distribution sources are added and old distribution sources are removed. Search advertising customers may view these changes to the distribution network negatively, and existing or potential search advertising customers may elect to purchase fewer or no advertisements for display on our distribution network. If this occurs, it is likely that our average RPC and average match rate may decline and our stock price would likely suffer.\nWe have launched a solution that is dependent on our customers\u2019 use of search advertising. Any decrease in the use of search advertising or our inability to further penetrate mobile, social and display advertising channels would harm our business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe expect that search advertising will become a channel increasingly used by our customers in the foreseeable future. Should our customers lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of search advertising, the demand for our solutions may decline, which would harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we cannot increase the capacity of our advertising technology platform to meet advertiser demand, our business will be harmed.\nWe must be able to continue to increase the capacity of our technology platforms in order to support substantial increases in the number of advertisers, to support an increasing variety of advertising formats and to maintain a stable service infrastructure and reliable service delivery for advertising campaigns. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively increase the scale of our advertising platforms to support and manage a substantial increase in the number of advertisers, while also maintaining a high level of performance, the quality of our services could decline and our reputation and business could be seriously harmed. In addition, if we are not able to support emerging advertising formats or services preferred by advertisers, we may be unable to obtain new advertising clients or may lose existing advertising customers, and in either case our revenue could decline.\nThe market for digital advertising is relatively new and dependent on growth in various digital advertising channels. If this market develops more slowly or differently than we expect, our business, growth prospects and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe market for digital advertising products such as ours is relatively new and these products may not achieve or sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. While search and display advertising has been used successfully for several years, marketing via new digital advertising channels such as social media is not as well established. The future growth of our business could be constrained by the level of acceptance and expansion of emerging digital advertising channels, as well as the continued use and growth of existing channels, such as search and display advertising. Even if these channels become widely adopted, advertisers and agencies may not make significant investments in solutions such as ours that help them manage their digital advertising spend across publisher platforms and advertising channels. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates, customer demand for our platform, the future growth rate and size of the digital advertising market or the entry of competitive products. Any expansion of the market for digital advertising management solutions depends on a number of factors, including the growth of the digital advertising market, the growth of social as an advertising channel and the cost, performance and perceived value associated with digital advertising management solutions. If our digital advertising products, including those in the social media space, do not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand for digital advertising caused by weakening economic conditions, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, it could result in reduced usage, which could decrease revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain the quality of our advertiser and developer content.\nWe must be able to ensure that our customers\u2019 ads are not placed in publisher content that is unlawful or inappropriate. Likewise, publishers rely upon us not to distribute ads that are unlawful or inappropriate. If we are unable to ensure that the quality of our advertiser and publisher content does not decline as the number of advertisers and publishers we work with continues to grow, then our reputation and business may suffer.\nIf we are unable to attract new advertising customers and sell additional offerings to our existing customers, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nTo sustain or increase our revenue, we must add new advertisers and encourage existing advertisers (both of which are often represented by advertising agencies or other Intermediaries), to purchase additional offerings from us. As the digital advertising industry matures and as competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that compete with or are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell our solution to new and existing advertisers based on our offerings, pricing, technology platform and functionality could be impaired. Some advertisers that are repeat users of our solution tend to increase their spend over time. Conversely, some advertisers that are newer to our solution tend to spend less than, and may not return as frequently as, advertisers who have used our solution for longer periods of time. If we fail to retain or cultivate the spending of our newer, lower-spending advertisers, it will be difficult for us to sustain and grow our revenue from existing advertisers. Even with long-time advertisers, we may reach a point of saturation at which we cannot continue to grow our revenue from those advertisers because of internal limits that advertisers may place on the allocation of their advertising budgets to digital media, to particular campaigns, to a particular provider, or for other reasons not known to us. If we are unable to attract new advertisers or obtain new business from existing advertisers, our revenue growth and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not introduce new and upgraded products and services and successfully adapt to our rapidly changing industry, our financial condition may suffer.\nThe online search advertising industry continues to evolve and we will need to continue developing new and upgraded products and services, and adapt to new business environments and competition in order to maintain and grow revenue and reach our profitability goals. New search advertising technologies could emerge that make our services comparatively less useful or new business methods could emerge that divert web traffic away from our advertising network. In addition, competition from other web businesses may prevent us from attracting substantial traffic to our services. We may inaccurately predict trends in the online search advertising market, which could lead us to make investments in technologies and products that do not generate sufficient returns. We may face platform and resource constraints that prevent us from developing upgraded products and services. We may fail to successfully identify new products or services, or fail to bring new products or services to market in a timely and efficient manner. Rapid industry change makes it difficult for us to accurately anticipate customer needs for our products, particularly over longer periods.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors because competition in our industry is intense, and our competitors may offer solutions that are perceived by our customers to be more attractive than ours. These factors could result in declining revenue, or inability to grow our business.\nCompetition for our advertiser customers\u2019 advertising budgets is intense. We also expect competition to increase as the barriers to enter our market are low. Increased competition may force us to charge less for our solution, or offer pricing models that are less attractive to us and decrease our margins. Our principal competitors include companies that offer demand side and data management platforms that allow advertisers to purchase inventory directly from advertising exchanges or other third parties and manage and analyze their own consumer data, traditional advertising networks and advertising agencies themselves. We compete with large companies that provide paid placement products, paid inclusion products, and other forms of search marketing as well as contextually-targeted advertising products and other types of online advertisements. We compete for search advertising customers on the basis of the quality and composition of our network, the price-per-click (\u201cPPC\u201d) charged to search advertising customers, the volume of clicks that we can deliver to search advertising customers, tracking and reporting of campaign results, customer service, and other factors. We also compete for distribution network partners and for ad placement on those partners\u2019 sites on the basis of the relevance of our ads and the PPC charged to search advertising customers. We also experience competition in offering our publisher products to website publishers. Some of our competitors have larger distribution networks and proprietary traffic bases, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, higher RPC, better relevance and conversion rates, or better products and services than we have.\nWe compete with companies, such as Google, which are significantly larger than us and have more capital to invest in their advertising businesses. We also compete with in-house solutions used by companies who choose to coordinate advertising across their own properties, such as Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo! and Pandora. They, or other companies that offer competing advertising solutions, may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with their partners, brand advertisers, app developers or other parties, thereby limiting our ability to promote our services and generate revenue. Competitors could also seek to gain market share from us by reducing the prices they charge to advertisers or by introducing new technology tools for developers. Moreover, increased competition for online advertising space from developers could result in an increase in the portion of advertiser revenue that we must pay to developers to acquire that advertising space.\nOur business will suffer to the extent that our Intermediary and advertiser customers purchase and sell advertising directly from each other or through other companies that are able to become Intermediaries. For example, we are aware of companies that have substantial existing platforms for developers who had previously not heavily used those platforms for advertising campaigns. These companies could compete with us to the extent they expand into advertising. Other companies, such as large app developers with a substantial advertising business, may decide to directly monetize some or all of their advertising space without utilizing our services. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, exchange or other third party services may also become Intermediaries between advertisers and publishers and thereby compete with us. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our services and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share.\nWe have previously derived a portion of our revenues from display advertising. A decrease in the use of display advertising, or our inability to further penetrate display, search, and social advertising channels would harm our business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nHistorically, we have had customers use our solution for display advertising. We expect that display advertising will continue to be a significant channel used by our customers. Recently, the market for display advertising, excluding social, has been declining as overall display advertising growth has been driven by mobile, social and video advertising. Should our customers lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of display advertising, the demand for our display solution could decline. In addition, our failure to achieve market acceptance of our solution for social advertising would harm our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have long-term commitments from our advertisers, and we may not be able to retain advertisers or attract new advertisers that provide us with revenue that is comparable to the revenue generated by any advertisers we may lose.\nMost of our advertisers do business with us by placing insertion orders for particular advertising campaigns. If we perform well on a particular campaign, then the advertiser, or most often, the advertising agency representing the advertiser, may place new insertion orders with us for additional advertising campaigns. We rarely have any commitment from an advertiser beyond the campaign governed by a particular insertion order. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to outperform our competitors and win repeat business from existing advertisers, while continually expanding the number of advertisers for whom we provide services. In addition, it is relatively easy for advertisers and the advertising agencies that represent them to seek an alternative provider for their advertising campaigns because there are no significant switching costs. Agencies, with whom we do the majority of our business, often have relationships with many different providers, each of whom may be running portions of the same advertising campaign. Because we generally do not have long-term contracts, it may be difficult for us to accurately predict future revenue streams. We cannot provide assurance that our current advertisers will continue to use our solution, or that we will be able to replace departing advertisers with new advertisers that provide us with comparable revenue.\nIf we serve our advertisers\u2019 advertisements on undesirable websites, our reputation will suffer, which would harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on providing advertisers with a service that they trust. We take action in an effort to prevent advertisements from appearing on undesirable websites. We may distribute advertising to inventory that is objectionable to advertisers, and we may lose the trust of our advertiser customers, which would harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our access to quality advertising inventory is diminished or if we fail to have access to new advertising inventory, our revenue could decline and our growth could be impeded.\nWe must maintain a consistent supply of attractive advertising inventory, meaning the digital space on which we place advertising impressions, including websites, proprietary social networks, such as Facebook, and mobile applications. Our success depends on our ability to secure quality inventory on reasonable terms across a broad range of advertising networks and exchanges, including real time advertising exchanges, such as Google\u2019s DoubleClick Ad Exchange or AppNexus; suppliers of video and mobile inventory; and social media platforms, such as the Facebook Exchange, known as FBX.\nThe amount, quality and cost of inventory available to us can change at any time. Our suppliers are generally not bound by long-term contracts. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that we will have access to a consistent supply of quality inventory. Moreover, the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from real-time advertising exchanges continues to increase, which could put upward pressure on inventory costs. If we are unable to compete favorably for advertising inventory available on real-time advertising exchanges, or if real-time advertising exchanges decide not to make their advertising inventory available to us, we may not be able to place advertisements at competitive rates or find alternative sources of inventory with comparable traffic patterns and consumer demographics in a timely manner. Furthermore, the inventory that we can access through real-time advertising exchanges may be of low quality or misrepresented to us, despite attempts by us and our suppliers to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance checks.\nSuppliers control the bidding process for the inventory they supply, and their processes may not always work in our favor. For example, suppliers may place restrictions on the use of their inventory, including restrictions that prohibit the placement of advertisements on behalf of certain advertisers. Through the bidding process, we may not win the right to deliver advertising to the inventory that we select and may not be able to replace inventory that is no longer made available to us.\nIf we are unable to maintain a consistent supply of quality inventory for any reason, our business, advertiser retention and loyalty, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nIf our access to quality inventory in social media is diminished or if we fail to acquire new advertising inventory in social media, our growth could be impeded and our revenue could decline.\nIf we are unable to compete favorably for advertising inventory on Facebook\u2019s FBX, our social media offering may not be successful. Also, we cannot provide assurance that Facebook will continue to make its advertising inventory available to us upon reasonable terms or at all, and we may not be able to replace the FBX advertising inventory with inventory that meets our advertisers\u2019 specific goals with respect to social media. In addition, advertisers may prefer to work with companies that provide advertising on social media platforms other than FBX or that have a longer history of integration with social media platforms. If we are unable to run advertising campaigns on the FBX platform, integrate with social media platforms that may become available in the future or find alternative sources of quality social media inventory, our business could be harmed.\nIf mobile connected devices, their operating systems or content distribution channels, including those controlled by our competitors, develop in ways that prevent our advertising campaigns from being delivered to their users, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\nOur success in the mobile channel depends upon the ability of our technology platform to integrate with mobile inventory suppliers and provide advertising for most mobile connected devices, as well as the major operating systems that run on them and the thousands of applications that are downloaded onto them. The design of mobile devices and operating systems is controlled by third parties with whom we do not have any formal relationships. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices. If our solution were unable to work on these devices or operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because an operating system or app developer, device maker or carrier wished to impair our ability to purchase inventory and provide advertisements, our ability to generate revenue could be significantly harmed.\nIf we do not deliver quality traffic that delivers value for advertisers, then our advertisers and our advertising partners may pay us less for their listing or discontinue listing with us altogether.\nFor our services to be successful, we need to deliver consumers to advertisers\u2019 websites that are valuable to such advertiser. If we do not meet advertisers\u2019 expectations by delivering quality traffic, then our advertising partners may pay us less per click or cease doing business with us altogether, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. We compete with other web search services, online publishers and high-traffic websites, as well as traditional media such as television, radio and print, for a share of our advertisers\u2019 total advertising expenditures. Many potential advertisers and advertising agencies have only limited experience advertising on the Internet and have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to search advertising. Acceptance of our advertising offerings among our advertisers and advertising partners will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the continued growth of commercial usage of the Internet. If we experience downward pricing pressure for our services in the future, our financial results may suffer.\nWe depend on publishers for advertising space to deliver our advertiser customers\u2019 advertising campaigns, and any decline in the supply of advertising inventory from these publishers could hurt our business.\nWe depend on publishers, both search and social media, to provide us with space (advertising inventory) into which to distribute advertisements. There is no contractually bound obligation to make advertising inventory available to us or our customers, or to provide us with a consistent supply of advertising inventory. Furthermore, there are tools that exist that parties could use which could result in pressure to increase the prices paid to publishers for that inventory or to otherwise block access to this inventory, without which we would be unable to facilitate the distribution of ads on behalf of our advertiser customers.\nPublishers can change the amount of inventory they make available to us at any time. They may also change the price at which they offer inventory, or they may elect to make advertising space available to our competitors who offer ads to them on more favorable economic terms. In addition, publishers may place significant restrictions on use of their advertising inventory. These restrictions may prohibit ads from specific advertisers or specific industries, or they could restrict the use of specified creative content or format. Publishers may also use a fee-based or subscription-based business model to generate revenue from their content, in lieu of or to reduce their reliance on ads.\nIf publishers decide not to make advertising inventory available to us for any of these reasons, decide to increase the price of inventory, or place significant restrictions on our use of their advertising space, we may not be able to replace this with inventory from other publishers that satisfy our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. If this happens, our revenue could decline or our cost of acquiring inventory could increase.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with our advertiser customers, and we may be unable to retain key customers, attract new customers or replace departing customers with customers that can provide comparable revenue to us.\nOur success requires us to maintain and expand our current advertiser customer relationships and to develop new relationships. Our contracts with our advertiser customers generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our services and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. As a result, we may have limited visibility as to our future advertising revenue streams. We cannot assure you that our advertiser customers will continue to use our services or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenue. If a major advertising customer representing a significant portion of our business decides to materially reduce its use of our platform or to cease using our platform altogether, our revenue could be significantly reduced. Advertisers in general may shift their business to a competitor\u2019s platform because of new or more compelling offerings, strategic relationships, technological developments, pricing and other financial considerations, or a variety of other reasons, which could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and harm our business.\nOur acquisition of businesses and technologies may be costly and time-consuming; acquisitions may also dilute our existing stockholders.\nFrom time to time we evaluate strategic corporate development opportunities and when appropriate, may make acquisitions of or significant investments in complementary companies or technologies to increase our technological capabilities expand our service offerings, or extend the operating scale of our network businesses. The pursuit of acquisitions, whether or not completed, as well as the completion of any acquisitions and their integration may be expensive and may divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of the company. It may be difficult to retain key management and technical personnel of the acquired company during the transition period following an acquisition. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in dilution to our existing stockholders if we issue additional equity securities or increase our debt to pay for such acquisitions. We may also be required to amortize significant amounts of intangible assets, record impairment of goodwill in connection with future acquisitions, or divest non-performing assets at below-market prices, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. Integration of acquired companies and technologies into the company is likely to be expensive, time-consuming, and strain our managerial resources. We may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses or technologies and these transactions may not achieve anticipated business benefits.\nIf we fail to make the right investment decisions in our offerings and technology platform, we may not attract and retain advertisers and advertising agencies and our revenue and results of operations may decline.\nWe compete for advertisers, which are often represented by advertising agencies, who want to purchase digital media for advertising campaigns. Our industry is subject to rapid changes in standards, technologies, products and service offerings, as well as in advertiser demands and expectations. We continuously need to make decisions regarding which offerings and technology to invest in to meet advertiser demand and evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements. We may make wrong decisions regarding these investments. For example, we expect advertisers to award us credit, or attribution, for impressions that generate specific consumer purchases or responses using certain criteria such as last ad clicked or viewed. Our technology considers these attribution models and if new attribution models are introduced by advertisers, we may need to make changes in our technology. If new or existing competitors offer more attractive offerings, we may lose advertisers or advertisers may decrease their spending on our solution. New advertiser demands, superior competitive offerings or new industry standards could render our existing solution unattractive, unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial unanticipated changes to our technology platform or business model. Our failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or to anticipate advertiser demand could harm our business and our financial performance.\nOur acquisition of Syncapse and ShopWiki could have a negative impact on our business, or on our stock price.\nOn September 3, 2013, we purchased the assets of Syncapse, Inc. (\u201cSyncapse\u201d) and on December 17th, 2014, we acquired ShopWiki. This acquisition could disrupt our business in the following ways, any of which could negatively affect our stock price or could harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects:\n\u25cf our customers and other third party business partners may seek to terminate or renegotiate their relationships as a result of our acquisition of Syncapse, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements or otherwise;\n\u25cf the attention of our management may be directed toward the integration of our businesses and related matters and may be diverted from our current business operations, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us; and\n\u25cf current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with our company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel.\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated by the acquisition, including estimated cost savings and synergies, or it may take longer than we anticipate for us to achieve those benefits.\nOur realization of the benefits anticipated as a result of the acquisition of the assets of Syncapse will depend in part on the integration and development of Syncapse\u2019s assets with ours. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate a business using the Syncapse\u2019s assets profitably or integrate it successfully into our operations in a timely fashion, or at all. Following the acquisition, the size of the combined company\u2019s business is significantly larger than our business was prior to the acquisition. Our future success as a combined company depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for our management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. The dedication of management resources to this integration could detract attention from our current day-to-day business, and we cannot assure you that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or other negative consequences as a result of these integration efforts. These effects, including, but not limited to, incurring unexpected costs or delays in connection with integration of the two businesses, or the failure of the business created using Syncapse\u2019s assets to perform as expected, could harm our results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and attracting new customers. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as a result of our marketing and brand promotion activities. We may not generate customer awareness or increase revenues enough to offset the increased expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial marketing and sales expenses, which are not offset by increased revenues, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is essential for broad customer adoption of our solution.\nFailure to adequately manage our growth may seriously harm our business.\nWe have in the past experienced, and may again in the future experience, significant growth in our business. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our services may suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services. Our growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational and financial resources and our infrastructure. Our future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively. This will require us to, among other things:\n\u25cf implement additional management information systems;\n\u25cf further develop our operating, administrative, legal, financial and accounting systems and controls;\n\u25cf hire additional personnel;\n\u25cf develop additional levels of management within our company;\n\u25cf locate additional office space;\n\u25cf maintain close coordination among our engineering, operations, legal, finance, sales and marketing and client service and support organizations; and\n\u25cf manage our expanding international operations.\nMoreover, as our sales increase, we may be required to concurrently deploy our services infrastructure at multiple additional locations or provide increased levels of customization. As a result, we may lack the resources to deploy our services on a timely and cost-effective basis. Failure to accomplish any of these requirements could impair our ability to deliver our mobile advertising platform in a timely fashion, fulfill existing client commitments or attract and retain new clients.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel; if we were unable to attract and retain key personnel in the future, our business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate highly skilled development, technical, sales, and management personnel. We have a limited number of key development, technical, sales and management personnel performing critical company functions, and the loss of the services of any of our key employees, particularly any of our executive team members or key technical personnel, could adversely affect our business. The combination of stock volatility of Company stock and the Company\u2019s small market capitalization may not allow us to offer competitive equity based compensation to attract and retain key personnel.\nIf we do not attract additional sales and technology talent, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled managers and employees, particularly employees with technical skills that enable us to deliver effective mobile advertising solutions and sales, and client support representatives with experience in mobile and other digital advertising and strong relationships with brand advertisers and app developers. Competition for these employees in our industry is intense. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain these management, technical, sales and client support personnel that are critical to our success, resulting in harm to our key client relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals.\nWe face capacity constraints on our software and infrastructure systems that may be costly and time-consuming to resolve.\nWe use proprietary and licensed software and databases to receive and analyze advertisements, campaigns and budgets, match search queries to advertising, analyze webpage information to match advertising to relevant content, integrate third-party ads, detect invalid clicks, serve ads in high volume, and track, analyze and report on advertising responses and campaigns. Any of these software systems may contain undetected errors, defects or bugs, or may fail to operate with other software applications. The following developments may strain our capacity and result in technical difficulties with our service or the websites of our distribution network partners:\n\u25cf customization of our matching algorithms and ad serving technologies,\n\u25cf substantial increases in the number of queries to our database,\n\u25cf substantial increases in the number of searches in our advertising databases, or\n\u25cf the addition of new products or new features or changes to our products.\nIf we experience difficulties with our software and infrastructure systems or if we fail to address these difficulties in a timely manner, we may lose the confidence of search advertisers and distribution network partners, our revenue may decline and our business could suffer. In addition, as we expand our service offerings and enter into new business areas, we may be required to significantly modify and expand our software and infrastructure systems. If we fail to accomplish these tasks in a timely manner, our business will likely suffer.\nOur inability to use software licensed from third parties, or our use of open source software under license terms that interfere with our proprietary rights, could disrupt our business.\nOur technology platform incorporates software licensed from third parties, including some software, known as open source software, which we use without charge. Although we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our platform to our clients. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur. In the future, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platform, which licenses may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Alternatively, we may need to re-engineer our platform or discontinue use of portions of the functionality provided by our platform. In addition, the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using such software to others on unfavorable license terms. We may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts. Our inability to use third party software could result in disruptions to our business, or delays in the development of future offerings or enhancements of existing offerings, which could impair our business.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate security and supporting infrastructure as we scale our systems, we may experience outages and disruptions of our services which could harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.\nAs we grow our business, we expect to continue to further invest in technology services, hardware and software, including data centers, network services, storage and database technologies. Creating the appropriate support for our technology platform, including Big Data and our computational infrastructure, is expensive and complex, and our execution could result in inefficiencies or operational failures and increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks, which, in turn, could diminish the quality of our services and our performance for advertisers. The steps we take to increase the reliability, integrity and security of our systems as they scale may be expensive and may not prevent system failures or unintended vulnerabilities resulting from the increasing number of persons with access to our systems, complex interactions within our technology platform and the increasing number of connections with third party partners and vendors\u2019 technology. Operational errors or failures or successful cyber-attacks could result in damage to our reputation and loss of current and new advertisers and other business partners which could harm our business. In addition, we could be adversely impacted by outages and disruptions in the online platforms of our key business partners, such as the real-time advertising exchanges, who we rely upon for access to inventory.\nOur Data Center facility in Phoenix, Arizona is vulnerable to damage or service interruption resulting from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. Moreover, while we have a disaster recovery plan in place, we do not maintain a \u201chot failover\u201d instance of our software platform permitting us to immediately switch over in the event of damage or service interruption at our Data Center. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, any outages or vandalism or other misconduct, or a decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.\nAny changes in service levels at the facility or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems at or related to the facility that affect our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues, subject us to potential liability, or result in reduced usage of our platform. In addition, some of our customer contracts require us to issue credits for downtime in excess of certain levels and in some instances give our customers the ability to terminate their subscriptions.\nOur data and information systems and network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber security threats. If our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to our customer data or our proprietary business information, our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure, which could harm our business and reputation, and our proprietary business information could be misappropriated which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn our operations, we store and transmit our proprietary information and information related to our customers. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity of our facilities and operations. Despite our security measures, our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information which has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations. Breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance of such an attack on our systems. In addition, if we select a vendor that uses cyber or \u201ccloud\u201d storage of information as part of their service or product offerings, despite our attempts to validate the security of such services, our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties. In the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers. Additionally, misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business.\nErrors or failures in our software and systems could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted performance of our technology platform to operate over 1,000 campaigns at any given time; manage our inventory supply; bid on inventory for each campaign; serve or direct a third party to serve advertising; collect, process and interpret data to optimize campaign performance in real time; and provide billing information to our financial systems. If our technology platform cannot scale to meet demand, or if there are errors in our execution of any of these functions on our platform, then our business could be harmed. Because our software is complex, undetected errors and failures may occur, especially when new versions or updates are made. We do not have the capability to test new releases or updates to our code on a small subset of campaigns, which means that bugs or errors in code could impact all campaigns on our platform. Despite testing by us, errors or bugs in our software have in the past, and may in the future, not be found until the software is in our live operating environment. For example, we may experience failures in our bidding system to recognize or respond to budget restrictions for campaigns, resulting in overspending on media, and we may in the future have failures in our systems that cause us to buy more media than our advertisers are contractually obligated to pay for, which could be costly and harm our operating results. Errors or failures in our software could also result in negative publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solution, increased costs or loss of revenue, loss of competitive position or claims by advertisers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required or choose to expend additional resources to help mitigate any problems resulting from errors in our software. We may make errors in the measurement of our campaigns causing discrepancies with our advertisers\u2019 measurements leading to a lack in confidence with us or, on occasion, the need for advertiser \u201cmake-goods,\u201d the standard credits given to advertisers for campaigns that have not been delivered properly. Alleviating problems resulting from errors in our software could require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays or the cessation of our business, any of which would adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nSoftware and components that we incorporate into our advertising platform may contain errors or defects, which could harm our reputation and hurt our business.\nWe use a combination of custom and third party software, including open source software, in building our advertising platforms. Although we test software before incorporating it into our platforms, we cannot guarantee that all of the third party technology that we incorporate will not contain errors, bugs or other defects. We continue to launch enhancements to our mobile advertising platform, and we cannot guarantee any such enhancements will be free from these kinds of defects. If errors or other defects occur in technology that we utilize in our mobile advertising platform, it could result in damage to our reputation and losses in revenue, and we could be required to spend significant amounts of additional resources to fix any problems.\nThe recent global financial crisis, uncertainty in global economic conditions and out history of losses may have significant negative effects on our access to credit and our ability to raise capital.\nThe recent global financial crisis which has included, among other things, significant reductions in and heightened credit quality standards for available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit, substantial reductions and/or fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide, and concerns that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period, may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital or obtain additional credit, when needed, on acceptable terms or at all. We may need to enter into additional credit facilities in the future to operate the business. Our history of operating losses may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing for our operations, investing activities, or financing activities. This difficulty or inability could materially limit our business operations and adversely affect our business performance.\nIf we do not comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreements, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur credit facilities contain provisions that could limit our ability to, among other things, incur, create or assume additional debt, sell or otherwise dispose of our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets, or consolidate or merge with or into, or acquire the obligations or stock of, or any other interest in, another person. In addition, our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth and liquid assets. Our ability to meet those financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to satisfy these covenants. If we fail to comply with these covenants, we may be required to identify restricted cash equal to our outstanding capital lease balance, if any, plus our outstanding standby letter of credit (\u201cSBLC\u201d) or, in the event of default, we may be required to pay the lenders cash in an amount equal to the capital lease balance, if any is outstanding. Paying such cash balances could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nRisks Related to Operating in our Industry\nEconomic downturns and political and market conditions beyond our control could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for advertising and on the economic health of our current and prospective advertisers. Economic downturns or instability in political or market conditions may cause current or new advertisers to reduce their advertising budgets. Adverse economic conditions and general uncertainty about economic recovery are likely to affect our business prospects. In particular, uncertainty regarding the budget crisis in the United States may cause general business conditions in the United States and elsewhere to deteriorate or become volatile, which could cause advertisers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our solution, This could expose us to increased credit risk on advertiser orders, which, in turn, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, concerns over the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the EU as well as continued geopolitical turmoil in many parts of the world have, and may continue to, put pressure on global economic conditions, which could lead to reduced spending on advertising.\nCyclical and seasonal fluctuations in the economy, in internet usage and in traditional retail shopping may have an effect on our business.\nBoth cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality may affect our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nSeasonal fluctuations in advertising activity could adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur cash flows from operations could vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of our advertisers\u2019 spending. For example, many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. To date, these seasonal effects have been masked by our rapid revenue growth. However, if and to the extent that seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period as a result.\nIf we fail to prevent, detect and remove invalid search queries and clicks, we could lose the confidence of our search advertisers, thereby causing our business to suffer.\nInvalid clicks are an ongoing problem for the Internet search advertising industry, and we are exposed to the risk of invalid clicks on customers\u2019 text advertisements coming from within our distribution network. Invalid clicks occur when a person or robotic software causes a click on a paid listing to occur for some reason other than to view the underlying content. Invalid clicks are commonly referred to as \u201cclick fraud.\u201d We continue to invest significant time and resources in preventing, detecting and eliminating invalid traffic from our distribution network. However, the perpetrators of click fraud have developed sophisticated methods to evade detection, and we are unlikely to be able to completely detect and remove all invalid traffic from our search network.\nCurrently and in the past we have been subject to advertiser complaints and litigation regarding invalid clicks, and we may be subject to search advertising customer complaints, claims, litigation or inquiries in the future. We have from time to time credited invoices or refunded revenue to our customers due to invalid traffic, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. If our systems to detect invalid traffic are insufficient, or if we find new evidence of past invalid clicks, we may have to issue credits or refunds retroactively to our search advertisers, and we may still have to pay revenue share to our distribution network partners. This could negatively affect our profitability and hurt our brand. If traffic consisting of invalid clicks is not detected and removed from our advertising network, the affected search advertising customers may experience a reduced return on their investment in our online advertising because the invalid clicks will not lead to conversions for the search advertising customers. This could lead the search advertisers to become dissatisfied with our products, which could lead to loss of search advertising customers and revenue and could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe compete with many companies, some of whom are more established and better capitalized than us.\nWe compete with a variety of companies on a worldwide basis both through the Internet and in traditional markets. Many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than us. There are also few barriers to entry in our markets. Our competitors may develop services that are superior to, or have greater market acceptance than our services. For example, many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger client bases. In addition, current and potential competitors are making, and are expected to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative, and, in some cases, exclusive relationships with significant companies or competitors to expand their businesses or to offer more comprehensive products and services.\nSystem failures could significantly disrupt our operations and cause us to lose advertiser customers or advertising inventory.\nOur success depends on the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our own internal systems, which we utilize to distribute and place ads, monitor the performance of advertising campaigns and manage inventory of advertising space. Our revenue depends on the technological ability of our platforms to deliver ads and measure them on a per click basis. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide services to customers, including technological failures affecting our ability to deliver ads quickly and accurately and to process users\u2019 responses to ads, could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our services to advertisers and reduce our revenue. Our systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power outages, malicious human acts and natural disasters. In addition, any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive and may not ultimately be successful in preventing system failures.\nAny failure in the performance of our key production systems could materially and adversely affect our revenues.\nAny system failure that interrupts our hosted products or services, whether caused by computer viruses, software failure, power interruptions, intruders, hackers, or other causes, could harm our financial results. For example, our system for tracking and invoicing clicks is dependent upon a proprietary software platform. If we lose key personnel or experience a failure of software, this system may fail. In such event, we may be unable to track paid clicks and invoice our customers, which would materially and adversely affect our financial results and business reputation. Moreover, our services are governed by Service Level Agreements that, if not met, require the payment of credits to our customers depending upon the level of service interruption.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster or unanticipated problems at our principal headquarters or at a third-party data center could cause interruptions or delays in our business. A loss of data could render us unable to provide some services. Our California facilities exist on or near known earthquake fault zones and a significant earthquake could cause an interruption in our services. An interruption in our ability to serve advertisements, track paid clicks, bill and collect invoices, and provide customer support would materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business and operations depend on Internet service providers and third party technology providers, and any failure or system downtime experienced by these companies could materially and adversely affect our revenues.\nOur distribution network partners and search advertising customers depend on Internet service providers, online service providers and other third parties for access to our services. These service providers have experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages, delays and other operating difficulties in the future. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have agreements with third-party click tracking and ad-serving technology providers. We do not presently maintain fully redundant click tracking, customer account, and web serving systems at separate locations. Accordingly, our operations depend on the ability of our Data Center to protect the systems in their data centers from system failures, earthquake, fire, power loss, water damage, telecommunications failure, hacking, vandalism, and similar events. We cannot guarantee that our Internet access will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Although we maintain property insurance and business interruption insurance, such insurance may not protect against some risks and we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of a catastrophic system failure. Also, if our third-party click tracking or ad-serving technology providers experience service interruptions, errors or security breaches, our ability to track, realize, and record revenue would suffer.\nWe may face liability for claims related to our products and services, and these claims may be costly to resolve.\nInternet users, search advertisers, other customers, and companies in the Internet, technology and media industries frequently enter into litigation based on allegations related to defamation, negligence, personal injury, breach of contract, unfair advertising, unfair competition, invasion of privacy, patent infringement or other claims. Lawsuits are filed against us from time to time. As we enter foreign markets, our potential liability could increase. In addition, we are obligated in some cases to indemnify our customers or distribution network partners in the event that they are subject to claims that our services infringe on the rights of others.\nLitigating these claims could consume significant amounts of time and money, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause delays in integrating acquired technology or releasing new products, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our insurance may not adequately cover claims of this type, if at all. If a court were to determine that some aspect of our services infringed upon or violated the rights of others, we could be prevented from offering some or all of our services, which would negatively impact our revenue and business. For any of the foregoing reasons, litigation involving our listings business and technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our services, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and patent applications, as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our intellectual property and proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nWe seek patent protection for certain of our technologies and currently have 3 issued U.S. patents. We are also pursuing the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark, domain name and patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. We may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional patent filings that could be expensive and time-consuming.\nWe have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, some of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take unauthorized actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many countries, such as China and India, do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of European countries and the United States. Further, the laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property rights. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our mobile advertising services. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights.\nWe could be subject to infringement claims that may be costly to defend, result in the payment of settlements or damages or cause us to change the way we conduct our business.\nInternet, technology and media companies, as well as patent holding companies often possess a significant number of patents. Further, many of these companies and other parties are actively developing online advertising, search, indexing, electronic commerce and other Web-related technologies, as well as a variety of online business models and methods. We believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including, but not limited to, seeking patent protection. As a result, we may face claims of infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights held by others. Also, as we expand our business, acquire and maintain our customer base, and develop new technologies, products and services, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement claims. In the event that there is a claim or determination that we infringe third-party proprietary rights such as patents, copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other third party rights such as publicity and privacy rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements or be prevented from using the rights, which could require us to change our business practices in the future and limit our ability to compete effectively. We may also incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims regardless of the merit of such claims. The occurrence of any of these results could harm our brand and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, many of our agreements with our customers, partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims or determinations, which could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages.\nLitigation, regulation, legislation or enforcement actions directed at or materially affecting us may adversely affect the commercial use of our products and services and our financial results.\nNew lawsuits, laws, regulations and enforcement actions applicable to the online industry may limit the delivery, appearance and content of our advertising or our publisher customers\u2019 advertisers or otherwise adversely affect our business. If such laws are enacted, or if existing laws are interpreted to restrict the types and placements of advertisements we or our publishers\u2019 customers can carry, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results. For example, in 2002, the Federal Trade Commission, in response to a petition from a private organization, reviewed the way in which search engines disclose paid placement or paid inclusion practices to Internet consumers and issued guidance on what disclosures are necessary to avoid misleading consumers about the possible effects of paid placement or paid inclusion listings on the search results. In 2003, the United States Department of Justice issued statements indicating its belief that displaying advertisements for online gambling might be construed as aiding and abetting an illegal activity under federal law. In 2004, the United States Congress considered new laws regarding the sale of pharmaceutical products over the Internet and the use of adware to distribute advertisements on the Internet. In 2007, the Federal Trade Commission proposed new regulations relating to online behavioral targeting. Moreover, as we enter into foreign markets, we may become subject to additional regulation and legislation. If any new law or government agency were to require changes in the labeling, delivery or content of our advertisements, or if we are subject to legal proceedings regarding these issues, it may reduce the desirability of our services or the types of advertisements that we can run, and our business could be materially and adversely harmed. In addition, many of our agreements with our customers, partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain claims related to online advertising laws, regulations and enforcement actions, which could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages.\nIn addition, legislation or regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d), present ongoing compliance risks, and a failure to comply with these new laws and regulations could materially harm our business. As we continue our Section 404 compliance efforts we may identify significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses, in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. We may be unable to remediate any of these matters in a timely fashion, and/or our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our remediation efforts. Such failures could impact our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and could impact market perception of the quality of our financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nThe Company is involved, from time to time, in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect resolution of these matters to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position unless stated otherwise. However, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could, depending on its amount and timing, materially affect its results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a future period. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nActivities of our advertiser customers could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us.\nOur advertiser customers\u2019 promotion of their products and services may not comply with federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to mobile communications. Failure of our customers to comply with federal, state or local laws or our policies could damage our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws. We may also be liable to third parties for content in the ads we deliver if the artwork, text or other content involved violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws. Although we generally receive assurance from our advertisers that their ads are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property included in an ad, and although we are normally indemnified by the advertisers, a third party or regulatory authority may still file a claim against us. Any such claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could also hurt our reputation. Further, if we are exposed to legal liability as a result of the activities of our advertiser clients, we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, discontinue some of our services or otherwise expend significant resources.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\nIn the course of providing our services, we transmit and store information related to the ads we place. Federal, state and international laws and regulations can govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we collect across our advertising platform. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. We are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in our industry alleging various violations of privacy-related laws. Any such proceedings could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our services and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our clients from the costs or consequences of inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of providing our services.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is evolving, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. For example, in early 2012, the State of California entered into an agreement with several major mobile app platforms under which the platforms have agreed to require mobile apps to meet specified standards to ensure consumer privacy. Subsequently, in January 2013, the State of California released a series of recommendations for privacy best practices for the mobile industry. In January 2014, a California law also became effective amending the required disclosures for online privacy policies. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect our business.\nAs we expand our operations globally, compliance with regulations that differ from country to country may also impose substantial burdens on our business. In particular, the European Union has traditionally taken a broader view as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy regulations. In addition, individual EU member countries have had discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of the regulations, which has resulted in variation of privacy standards from country to country. In January 2012, the European Commission announced significant proposed reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, including changes in obligations of data controllers and processors, the rights of data subjects and data security and breach notification requirements. The EU proposals, if implemented, may result in a greater compliance burden if we deliver ads to mobile device users in Europe. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy.\nPrivacy-related regulation of the Internet could limit the ways we currently collect and use personal information, which could decrease our advertising revenues or increase our costs.\nInternet user privacy has become an issue both in the United States and abroad. The United States Congress and Federal Trade Commission are considering new legislation and regulations to regulate Internet privacy. The Federal Trade Commission and government agencies in some states and countries have investigated some Internet companies, and lawsuits have been filed against some Internet companies, regarding their handling or use of personal information. Any laws imposed to protect the privacy of Internet consumers may affect the way in which we collect and use personal information. We could incur additional expenses if new laws or court judgments, in the United States or abroad, regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if any agency chooses to investigate our privacy practices.\nWe, along with some of our distribution network partners or search advertising customers, retain information about our consumers. If others were able to penetrate the network security of these user databases and access or misappropriate this information, we and our distribution network partners or search advertising customers could be subject to liability. These claims may result in litigation, our involvement in which, regardless of the outcome, could require us to expend significant time and financial resources. In addition, many of our agreements with our customers, partners and affiliates require us to indemnify them for certain claims related to privacy laws, regulations and enforcement actions which could increase our costs in defending such claims and damages.\nLegislation and regulation of online businesses, including privacy and data protection regimes, could create unexpected costs, subject us to enforcement actions for compliance failures, or cause us to change our technology platform or business model, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment regulation could increase the costs of doing business online. U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering legislation related to online advertising and we expect to see an increase in legislation and regulation related to advertising online, the use of geo-location data to inform advertising, the collection and use of anonymous Internet user data and unique device identifiers, such as IP address or unique mobile device identifiers, and other data protection and privacy regulation. Recent revelations about bulk online data collection by the National Security Agency, and news articles suggesting that the National Security Agency may gather data from cookies placed by Internet advertisers to deliver interest based advertising, may further interest governments in legislation regulating data collection by commercial entities, such as advertisers and publishers and technology companies that serve the advertising industry. Such legislation could affect the costs of doing business online, and could reduce the demand for our solution or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. While we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data, such as name, email address, address, phone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial or health data, we may obtain information that are or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation. Evolving and changing definitions of personal data, within the EU, the United States and elsewhere, could cause us in the future, to change our business practices, or limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business. Data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and could result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. While we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use and disclose in the operation of our business, and to offer certain privacy protections with respect to such information, such measures may not always be effective. In addition, while we take steps to avoid collecting personally identifiable information about consumers, we may inadvertently receive this information from advertisers or advertising agencies or through the process of delivering advertising. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect personal data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of our officers and public censure, claims for damages by consumers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, could harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solution by current and future advertisers and advertising agencies.\nIf the use of \u201cthird party cookies\u201d is rejected by Internet users, restricted or otherwise subject to unfavorable regulation, our performance could decline and we could lose advertisers and revenue.\nAdvertisers and our partners use \u201ccookies\u201d (small text files) to gather important data in the delivery of advertisements. These cookies are placed through an Internet browser on an Internet user\u2019s computer and correspond to a data set. These cookies are known as \u201cthird party\u201d cookies because of a lack of a direct relationship with the Internet user. These cookies collect anonymous information, such as when an Internet user views an ad, clicks on an ad, or visits one of our advertiser customer\u2019s websites. On mobile devices, there may also be location based information about the user\u2019s device. These cookies are used to help achieve our advertiser customer\u2019s campaign goals, to help ensure that the same Internet user does not unintentionally see the same advertisement too frequently, to report aggregate information to advertisers regarding the performance of their advertising campaigns and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity throughout our network of inventory. Data from cookies are also used to help decide whether to bid on, and how much to bid on, an opportunity to place an advertisement in a certain location, at a given time, in front of a particular Internet user. A lack of data associated with cookies may detract from the ability to make decisions about which inventory to purchase for an advertiser\u2019s campaign, and undermine the effectiveness of our solution.\nCookies may easily be deleted or blocked by Internet users. All of the most commonly used Internet browsers (including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari) allow Internet users to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers. Internet users can also delete cookies from their computers at any time. Some Internet users also download \u201cad blocking\u201d software that prevents cookies from being stored on a user\u2019s computer. If more Internet users adopt these settings or delete their cookies more frequently than they currently do, our business could be harmed. In addition, the Safari browser blocks cookies by default, and other browsers may do so in the future. Unless such default settings in browsers were altered by Internet users, we would be able to set fewer of our cookies in browsers, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, companies such as Google have publicly disclosed their intention to move away from cookies to another form of persistent unique identifier, or ID, to indicate Internet users in the bidding process on advertising exchanges. If companies do not use shared IDs across the entire ecosystem, this could have a negative impact on our ability to find the same anonymous user across different web properties, and reduce the effectiveness of our solution.\nIn addition, in the European Union, or EU, Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the \u201cCookie Directive,\u201d directs EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet user\u2019s computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the Internet user has given his or her consent. We may not be able to develop or implement additional tools that compensate for the lack of data associated with cookies. Moreover, even if we are able to do so, such additional tools may be subject to further regulation, time consuming to develop or costly to obtain, and less effective than our current use of cookies.\nPotential \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standards or government regulation could negatively impact our business by limiting access to the anonymous user data that informs the advertising campaigns we facilitate, and as a result could degrade our performance for our customers.\nAs the use of cookies has received ongoing media attention over the past three years, some government regulators and privacy advocates have suggested creating a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standard that would allow Internet users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their web browser, not to have their website browsing recorded. All the major Internet browsers have implemented some version of a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d setting. Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer 10 includes a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d setting that is selected \u201con\u201d by default. However, there is no definition of \u201ctracking,\u201d no consensus regarding what message is conveyed by a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d setting and no industry standards regarding how to respond to a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d preference. It is possible that we could face competing policy standards, or standards that put our business model at a competitive disadvantage to other companies that collect data from Internet users, standards that reduce the effectiveness of our solution, or standards that require us to make costly changes to our solution. The Federal Trade Commission has stated that it will pursue a legislative solution if the industry cannot agree upon a standard. The \u201cDo-Not-Track Online Act of 2013\u201d was introduced in the United States Senate in February 2013. If a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d web browser setting is adopted by many Internet users, and the standard either imposed by state or federal legislation, or agreed upon by standard setting groups, requires us to recognize a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal and prohibits the use of non-personal data as currently done, then that could hinder growth of advertising and content production on the web generally, and limit the quality and amount of data we are able to store and use, which would cause us to change our business practices and adversely affect our business.\nOur business involves the use, transmission and storage of confidential information, and the failure to properly safeguard such information could result in significant reputational harm and monetary damages.\nWe may at times collect, store and transmit information of, or on behalf of, our clients that may include certain types of confidential information that may be considered personal or sensitive, and that are subject to laws that apply to data breaches. We believe that we take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts to protect this information. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed. Most states have enacted data breach notification laws and, in addition to federal laws that apply to certain types of information, such as financial information, federal legislation has been proposed that would establish broader federal obligations with respect to data breaches. We may also be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. The unauthorized disclosure of information may result in the termination of one or more of our commercial relationships or a reduction in client confidence and usage of our services. We may also be subject to litigation alleging the improper use, transmission or storage of confidential information, which could damage our reputation among our current and potential clients, require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and cause us to lose business and revenue.\nOnline commerce security risks, including security breaches, identity theft, service disrupting attacks and viruses, could harm our reputation and the conduct of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nA fundamental requirement for online commerce and communications is the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we have developed and use systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches, our security measures may not prevent security breaches or identity theft that could harm our reputation and business. Currently, a significant number of our customers provide credit card and other financial information and authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction data. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a user\u2019s password could access the user\u2019s transaction data. An increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security. Any compromise of our security could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of litigation and possible liability. The coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nAdditionally, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, and we have experienced \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Disruptions in our services and damage caused by viruses and other attacks could cause a loss of user confidence in our systems and services, which could lead to reduced usage of our products and services and materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur data and information systems and network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber security threats. If our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to our customer data or our proprietary business information, our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure, which could harm our business and reputation, and our proprietary business information could be misappropriated which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn our operations, we store and transmit our proprietary information and information related to our customers. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity of our facilities and operations. Despite our security measures, our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information which has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations. Breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance of such an attack on our systems. In addition, if we select a vendor that uses cyber or \u201ccloud\u201d storage of information as part of their service or product offerings, despite our attempts to validate the security of such services, our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties. In the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers. Additionally, misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business.\nNew tax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our search service and our financial results.\nTax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce. New or revised state tax regulations may subject us or our search advertising customers to additional state sales, income and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on commerce over the Internet. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over the Internet. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Capital Market\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate for many reasons, which may make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investors\u2019 and analysts; expectations, negatively affecting our stock price.\nOur revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past, and will likely fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Because our business is changing and evolving rapidly, our historical operating results may not be useful in predicting our future operating results. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include, without limitation:\n\u25cf changes in the composition and size of our Advertiser Network customer base;\n\u25cf changes in composition of our AdCenter customer base;\n\u25cf the seasonal nature of our customers\u2019 spending on digital advertising campaigns;\n\u25cf the pricing of advertising inventory or of other third-party services;\n\u25cf changes in our distribution network, particularly the gain or loss of key distribution network partners, or changes in the implementation of search results on partner websites;\n\u25cf changes in the intermediary business model which affect the entire online search advertising ecosystem;\n\u25cf changes in the number of search advertising customers who do business with us, or the amount of spending per customer;\n\u25cf the introduction of new technologies, product or service offerings by our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in our customers\u2019 advertising budget allocations, agency affiliations or marketing strategies;\n\u25cf the revenue-per-click we receive from search advertising customers, or other factors that affect the demand for, and prevailing prices of, Internet advertising and marketing services;\n\u25cf changes to our traffic acquisition costs related to our Advertiser Network, including changes to the economic prospects of our advertisers generally, which could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities and increase the time or costs required to complete sales with advertisers;\n\u25cf changes and uncertainty in the regulatory environment for us or our advertisers;\n\u25cf changes in the availability of advertising inventory through real-time advertising exchanges, or in the cost to reach end consumers through digital advertising;\n\u25cf changes in our capital expenditures as we acquire the hardware, equipment and other assets required to support our business;\n\u25cf costs related to the acquisition of people, business or technologies; and\n\u25cf systems downtime on our Advertiser Network, our website or the websites of our distribution network partners.\nDue to the above factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful, and you should not rely on past financial results as an indicator of our future performance. If our financial results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the market price of our securities would likely decline.\nOur stock price is extremely volatile, and such volatility may hinder investors\u2019 ability to resell their shares for a profit or avoid a loss.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years, and the stock prices of Internet companies have been extremely volatile. The low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect its liquidity and reduce the number of market makers and/or large investors willing to trade in our common stock, making wider fluctuations in the quoted price of our common stock more likely to occur. You should evaluate our business in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses, delays and difficulties associated with managing and growing a business in a relatively new industry, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur stock price may fluctuate, and you may not be able to sell your shares for a profit, as a result of a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents, by us or a competitor;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf introductions of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf enactment of new government regulations affecting our industry;\n\u25cf changes in the market valuations of Internet companies in general and comparable companies in particular;\n\u25cf quarterly fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf the termination or expiration of our distribution agreements;\n\u25cf our potential failure to meet our forecasts or analyst expectations on a quarterly basis;\n\u25cf the relatively thinly traded volume of our publicly traded shares, which means that small changes in the volume of trades may have a disproportionate impact on our stock price;\n\u25cf the loss of key personnel, or our inability to recruit experienced personnel to fill key positions;\n\u25cf changes in ratings or financial estimates by analysts or the inclusion/removal of our stock from certain stock market indices used to drive investment choices;\n\u25cf announcements of new distribution network partnerships, technological innovations, acquisitions or products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf the short selling of our stock;\n\u25cf the sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur; or\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the Internet that suggest a decline in rates of growth of advertising-based Internet companies.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted after periods of volatility in the market price of a Company\u2019s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, regardless of the merits or outcome of the case.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to support our operations and, if such additional financing is not available to us, on reasonable terms or at all, our liquidity and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted.\nAlthough we believe that our working capital will provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our other cash requirements for the foreseeable future, unanticipated developments in the short term, such as the entry into agreements which require large cash payments or the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows, may necessitate additional financing. We may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:\n\u25cf fund the additional operations and capital expenditures;\n\u25cf take advantage of favorable business opportunities, including geographic expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies;\n\u25cf develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure beyond current plans;\n\u25cf develop new product and service offerings;\n\u25cf take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets; or\n\u25cf respond to competitive pressures.\nThe capital markets, and in particular the public equity market for Internet companies, have historically been volatile. It is difficult to predict when, if at all, it will be possible for Internet companies to raise capital through these markets. We cannot assure you that the additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and our stock may not appreciate in value.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares will be able to be maintained.\nWe will incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the United States.\nAs a public company listed in the United States we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and stock exchanges, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts, which could result in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances (as described in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d), the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results could be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions. If, as a result, our operating results fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts, our stock price could decline. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, accounting for internal use software and income taxes.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 68% of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of deterring, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe depend on key persons and the loss of any key person could adversely affect our operations.\nThe future success of our business is dependent on our management team, including Michael Onghai, our Chief Executive Officer, and our professional team and employees. If one or more of our key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to easily replace them, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel. The loss of our key personnel could severely disrupt our business and its financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain key personnel in the future. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to attract or retain the key personnel needed to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we do not have in place \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of key members of our professional team or employees could negatively affect our financial performance.\nProvisions of Delaware corporate law and provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage a takeover attempt.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including an attempt that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, our charter and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors. These provisions, along with Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, prohibiting certain business combinations with an interested stockholder, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. This requires that we incur substantial professional fees and internal costs related to our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts.\nWe may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls in the future, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share", "PERMNO": 87173, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LKST"}
