{"cik": "16099", "company": "LUBYS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, and all other information included in this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.\nWe are exploring various strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, but this strategic review process may not result in the achievement of the desired goal of enhancing shareholder value.\nIn September 2019, we announced that our Board formed a new Special Committee with the purpose of establishing a strategic review process to identify, examine and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to the Company with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel. We may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating and preparing for any such strategic alternatives. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, regulatory limitations and the interest of third parties in us and our assets. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any specific action or transaction. Further, any such strategic alternative may not ultimately lead to increased shareholder value.\nGeneral economic and business conditions as well as those specific to the restaurant industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include consumer income, interest rates, inflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. The restaurant industry is affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, and consumer spending patterns. Discretionary consumer spending, which is critical to our success, is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. A deterioration in the global or local economy or other economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as unemployment levels, reduced home values, investment losses, inflation, business conditions, fuel and other energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, consumer confidence, interest rates, tax rates and changes in tax laws, may reduce consumer confidence and affected consumers\u2019 ability or desire to spend disposable income. This may adversely affect our business by reducing overall consumer spending or by causing customers to reduce the frequency with which they dine out or to shift their spending to our competitors, any of which could result in lower revenues, increased costs, reduced traffic, or limits on pricing, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegional events can adversely affect our financial performance.\nMany of our restaurants and franchises are located in Texas. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by economic conditions in Texas or the occurrence of an event of terrorism or natural disaster in any of the communities in which we operate. Also, given our geographic concentration, negative publicity relating to our restaurants could have a pronounced adverse effect on our overall revenues. Although we generally maintain property and casualty insurance to protect against property damage caused by casualties and natural disasters, inclement weather, flooding, hurricanes, and other acts of God, these events can adversely impact our sales by discouraging potential customers from going out to eat or by rendering a restaurant or CCS location inoperable for a significant amount of time.\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively or if customer preferences change, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive and is affected by changes in customer tastes and dietary habits and by national, regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends. New menu items, concepts, and trends are constantly emerging. Our Luby\u2019s Cafeteria brand offer a large variety of entr\u00e9es, side dishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and cafeteria-style dining. A change away from this cuisine or dining style could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Fuddruckers brand offers grilled-to-order burgers that feature always fresh and never frozen, 100% premium-cut beef with no fillers or additives and sesame-topped buns baked from scratch on-site throughout the day. While burgers are the signature, the engaging menu offers variety for many tastes with an array of sandwiches, and salads. Changing customer preferences, tastes and dietary habits can adversely affect our business and financial performance. We compete on quality, variety, value, service, concept, price, and location with well-established national and regional chains, as well as with locally owned and operated restaurants. We face significant competition from family-style restaurants, fast-casual restaurants, and buffets as well as fast food restaurants. In addition, we also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, delicatessen, and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry, which offers \u201cconvenient meals\u201d in the form of improved entr\u00e9es and side dishes from the delicatessen section. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. We also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for restaurant sites and personnel. We anticipate that intense competition will continue. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFailure of our efforts designed to effect a turn-around of the business could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have directed, and expect to continue to direct our efforts toward effecting a turn-around of the business with the aim of re-establishing a solid foundation from which profitability can be restored. This includes an asset sales program, menu innovation, efforts to attract and retain the most talented employees, culinary innovation enhancements, marketing initiatives, and the initiative to re-franchise company-owned Fuddruckers locations. Some or all of our efforts and initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain in their application to our business in general, even when tested successfully on a more limited scale. Failure to achieve successful implementation of any or all of our efforts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to service our debt obligations is primarily dependent upon our future financial performance.\nAs of August 28, 2019, we had shareholders\u2019 equity of $101 million compared to:\n\u2022\n$48.7 million of long-term debt comprised of a $43.4 million Term Loan and a $5.3 million Revolver;\n\u2022\n$40.2 million of minimum operating and capital lease commitments; and\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and proceeds from assets sales.\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may have to:\n\u2022\ndelay spending on maintenance projects and other capital projects, including new restaurant development;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nrestructure or refinance our debt; or\n\u2022\nsell equity securities.\nOur debt, and the covenants contained in the instruments governing our debt, could:\n\u2022\nresult in a reduction of our credit rating, which would make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities to the repayment of our debt and the interest associated with our debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on capital investments, debt levels, incurring additional debt and creating liens on our properties;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have relatively less debt;\n\u2022\nexpose us to interest rate risk because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; and\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business.\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may not be able to sell equity securities, sell additional assets, or restructure or refinance our debt. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness is subject to market conditions and other factors which are beyond our control.\nThe impact of inflation may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe impact of inflation on food, labor and other aspects of our business can adversely affect our results of operations. Commodity inflation in food, beverages, and utilities can also impact our financial performance. Although we attempt to offset the effects of inflation through periodic menu price increases, cost controls, and incremental improvement in operating margins, we may not be able to completely eliminate such effects, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face the risk of adverse publicity and litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe may from, time to time, be the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging illness, injury or other food quality, health or operational concerns. Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants or to the restaurant industry in general may taint public perception of the Luby\u2019s Cafeteria and Fuddruckers brands. Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness, or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Publicity resulting from these allegations may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are liable. In addition, we are subject to employee claims alleging injuries, wage and hour violations, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination. In recent years, a number of restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace, employment, and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately determined to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend, and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits, worker\u2019s compensation and employee injury claims.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we maintain a self-insured health benefit plan which provides medical and prescription drug benefits to certain of our employees electing coverage under the plan. Our exposure is limited by individual and aggregate stop-loss limits. We record expenses under the plan based on estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs and stop-loss insurance premiums. Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the expected liability for reported claims and the estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported, based on information on historical claims experience provided by our third party insurance advisors, adjusted as necessary based upon management\u2019s reasoned judgment. Actual employee medical claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions based on historical experience. In the event our cost estimates differ from actual costs, we could incur additional unplanned costs, which could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWorkers\u2019 compensation coverage is provided through \u201cself-insurance\u201d by LFR. We record expenses under the plan based on estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, stop-loss insurance premiums, and expected trends. These estimates are then adjusted each year to reflect actual costs incurred. Actual costs under these plans are subject to variability that is dependent upon demographics and the actual costs of claims made. In the event our cost estimates differ from actual costs, we could incur additional unplanned costs, which could adversely impact our financial condition.\nIn March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"Affordable Care Act\") and Healthcare Education and Affordability Reconciliation Act was passed and signed into law. Among other things, the healthcare reform legislation includes mandated coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and healthcare benefits. Although requirements were phased in over a period of time, the most impactful provisions began in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nDue to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations in some cases, and interpretive guidance, and the phased-in nature of the implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the healthcare reform legislation on our business and the businesses of our franchisees over the coming years. Possible adverse effects of the healthcare reform legislation include reduced revenues, increased costs and exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or risk of loss of business. It is also possible that healthcare plans offered by other companies with which we compete for employees will make us less attractive to our current or potential employees. And in any event, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act has imposed some additional administrative costs on us, and those costs may increase over time. In addition, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our franchisees face the potential of similar adverse effects, and many of them are small business owners who may have significant difficulty absorbing the increased costs.\nAn increase in the minimum wage and regulatory mandates could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures have increased and will consider increases in the minimum wage. The restaurant industry is intensely competitive, and if the minimum wage is increased, we may not be able to transfer all of the resulting increases in operating costs to our customers in the form of price increases. In addition, because our business is labor intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.\nWe assess our long-lived assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and determine when they are impaired. Based on market conditions and operating results, we may be required to record additional impairment charges, which would reduce expected earnings for the periods in which they are recorded.\nWe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information.\nWe accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. During fiscal 2019, approximately 75% of our restaurant sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions, and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase. A number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen, including a number of highly publicized incidents with well-known retailers in recent years. In addition, we have previously been the victim of a cyber attack by hackers who deployed a version of the SamSam ransomware that encrypted electronic files, locking us out of many of our point-of-sale and other systems. These hackers requested a \u201cransom\u201d payment in exchange for restoring\naccess to these encrypted files. Such attacks, while they did not provide the hackers with access to confidential customer and employee information, did adversely affect our profits due to our temporary inability to operate our restaurants and increased costs associated further protecting and restoring our computer systems. While we have taken preventative measures, no assurances can be provided that we will not be the subject of cyber attacks again in the future.\nWe may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.\nWe also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees, and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels, and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. At the same time, we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf. If the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we, or such third parties, otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including regional managers, restaurant general managers and chefs, in a manner consistent with our standards and expectations. Qualified individuals that we need to fill these positions are in short supply and competition for these employees is intense. If we are unable to recruit and retain sufficient qualified individuals, our operations and reputation could be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. Our financial condition and and announcement of our process of exploring strategic alternatives may result in difficulties in retaining and attracting qualified employees. Any increase in labor costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and react to changes in food, utility and other costs, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of the food and beverage products we purchase are affected by commodity pricing, and as such, are subject to price volatility caused by production problems, shortages, weather or other factors outside of our control. Our profitability depends, in part, on our successfully anticipating and reacting to changes in the prices of commodities. Therefore, we enter into purchase commitments with suppliers when we believe that it is advantageous for us to do so. If commodity prices were to increase, we may be forced to absorb the additional costs rather than transfer these increases to our customers in the form of menu price increases. Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs. Our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities. Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, healthcare, employee medical plans, sanitation, safety and fire standards, building codes and liquor licenses, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, family leave, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, healthcare and citizenship requirements), federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination, potential healthcare benefits legislative mandates, and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.\nAs a publicly traded corporation, we are subject to various rules and regulations as mandated by the SEC and the NYSE. Failure to timely comply with these rules and regulations could result in penalties and negative publicity.\nWe are subject to federal regulation and certain state laws which govern the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws contain provisions that supersede the terms of franchise agreements, including provisions concerning the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some state franchise laws require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in that state. The failure to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and the franchisees.\nTermination of franchise agreements may disrupt restaurant performance.\nOur franchise agreements are subject to termination by us in the event of default by the franchisee after applicable cure periods. Upon the expiration of the initial term of a franchise agreement, the franchisee generally has an option to renew the franchise agreement for an additional term. There is no assurance that franchisees will meet the criteria for renewal or will desire or be able to renew their franchise agreements. If not renewed, a franchise agreement, and payments required there under, will terminate. We may be unable to find a new franchisee to replace a non-renewing franchisee. Furthermore, while we will be entitled to terminate franchise agreements following a default that is not cured within the applicable grace period, if any, the disruption to the performance of the restaurants could adversely affect our business and revenues.\nFranchisees may breach the terms of their franchise agreements in a manner that adversely affects the reputation of our brands.\nFranchisees are required to conform to specified product quality standards and other requirements pursuant to their franchise agreements in order to protect our brands and to optimize restaurant performance. However, franchisees may receive through the supply chain or produce sub-standard food or beverage products, which may adversely impact the reputation of our brands. Franchisees may also breach the standards set forth in their respective franchise agreements. Any negative actions could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our business and revenues.\nOur strategic initiative to transition the majority of our company-owned Fuddruckers restaurants to franchise operators may not be fully realizable.\nOur success with this initiative requires entering into agreements with new or existing franchise owners on terms that are economically acceptable to us while presenting an attractive investment opportunity for those franchise owners. Our company-owned Fuddruckers locations are geographically dispersed with some markets containing only one or two locations. We may not be able to identify franchise owners willing and able to operate at these locations due to competitors operating in those markets that are more established or have greater penetration or brand presence.\nExpansion of our CCS operations may not be successful.\nSuccessful expansion of our CCS operations depends on our ability to obtain new clients as well as retain and renew our existing client contracts. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We may not be able to renew existing client contracts at the same or higher rates or our current clients may turn to competitors, cease operations, or elect to self-operate or terminate contracts with us. The failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to collect account receivables could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our accounts receivable is concentrated in our CCS operations among several customers. In addition, our franchises generate significant accounts receivables. Failure to collect from several of these accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.\nThe success of our business is highly dependent upon our key management personnel, particularly Christopher J. Pappas, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Benjamin T. Coutee, our Chief Operating Officer. The loss of the services of any key management personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may impair our ability to retain and motivate key management personnel.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, and, as a result, our results of operations for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our highest earnings have occurred in the third quarter of the fiscal year, as our revenues in most of our restaurants have typically been higher during the third quarter of the fiscal year. Similarly, our results of operations for any single quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos, and the unique ambience of our restaurants. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the internet, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. We may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations. This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs.\nThe price of our common stock may experience volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock can be volatile as we undertake the strategic review process, which may continue or become more severe if and when a transaction or business arrangement is announced or we announce that we are no longer exploring strategic alternatives.\nAppraisals of our properties are estimates of value and may not necessarily correspond to realizable value.\nThe appraisal methodologies used to appraise our properties involve subjective judgments. As a result, appraisals of our properties are only estimates of current market value as of the date of the appraisal. Ultimate realization of the value of a property depends to a great extent on economic and other conditions beyond our control and the control of the independent valuation firm and other parties involved in the valuation of our properties. Further, these valuations may not necessarily represent the price at which a property would sell, because market prices of properties can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller.", "PERMNO": 64020, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "LUB"}
