{"cik": "100517", "company": "United Continental Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the Company\u2019s business and the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other statements the Company or its representatives make from time to time. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report.\nGlobal economic, political and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable conditions may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by global economic and industry conditions. The airline industry is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and global economies. The Company is a global business with operations outside of the United States from which it derives significant operating revenues. The Company\u2019s international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network. Volatile economic, political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives.\nRobust demand for the Company\u2019s air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions, including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies, low unemployment levels, strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit. Air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times. In addition, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel, either due to cost-saving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel. During such periods, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand, particularly with respect to the Company\u2019s business and premium cabin travelers, and a reduction in fare levels.\nStagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the United States or in other geographic regions, and any future volatility in U.S. and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues, results of operations and liquidity. If such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future, the Company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms (or at all) to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments.\nIn June 2016, United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) voters voted for the UK to exit the EU. The UK parliament voted in favor of allowing the government to commence negotiations to determine the future terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, including the terms of trade between the UK and the EU and other nations. A process of negotiation is now taking place to determine the future terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. Depending on the outcome of these negotiations, we could face new challenges in our operations, such as instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and European euro, additional travel restrictions on passengers traveling between the UK and other EU countries and legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations. These adverse effects in European market conditions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse impact upon the Company\u2019s liquidity, revenues, costs and operating results.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe U.S. airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition including from low-cost carriers. The significant market presence of low-cost carriers, which engage in substantial price discounting, may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes.\nAirlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity, including route systems and the number of markets served. Several of the Company\u2019s domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the Company currently serves, causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations. This increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nTerrorist attacks or international hostilities, or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect the Company and the airline industry.\nThe terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the prospects for the airline industry. Among the effects experienced from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the FAA-imposed temporary grounding of the U.S. airline industry\u2019s fleet, significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience, increased insurance costs, substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue.\nAdditional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks (including elevated national threat warnings, travel restrictions or selective cancellation or redirection of flights) could materially and adversely affect the Company and the airline industry. Wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The Company\u2019s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities.\nIncreasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to increasing legislative, regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security. Also, a number of the Company\u2019s commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that the Company must meet and these standards continue to evolve. The Company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy and data security obligations; however, it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase the Company\u2019s costs. Additionally, the Company must manage evolving cybersecurity risks. The loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to customers\u2019, employees\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information or the Company\u2019s failure to meet its obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. A significant data breach or the Company\u2019s failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business.\nThe Company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business, including computerized airline reservation systems, flight operations systems, revenue management systems, accounting systems, telecommunication systems and commercial websites, including www.united.com. United\u2019s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information, as well as process critical financial transactions. These systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment or software failures, computer viruses or cyber security attacks. Substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions, including failures or disruptions related to the Company\u2019s complex integration of systems, could reduce the attractiveness of the Company\u2019s services versus those of its competitors, materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights, result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, result in increased costs, lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data, and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrent or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or arrangement relating to these actions, could have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies, including as described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this report. No assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of non-monetary remedies, and could also result in adverse publicity. Defending ourselves in these matters may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives. Additionally, any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment, settlement, fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance. If we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement, order or agreement with a governmental authority relating to these matters, we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into (and may in the future enter into) with our officers, directors and certain third parties, we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions, suits, investigations and other proceedings. There can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s regional network and United Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. These regional operations are an extension of the Company\u2019s mainline network and complement the Company\u2019s operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. The Company\u2019s business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network, with regional capacity accounting for approximately 11% of the Company\u2019s total capacity for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAlthough the Company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics, the Company does not control the operations of these carriers. A number of factors may impact the Company\u2019s regional network, including weather-related effects and seasonality. In addition, the decrease in qualified pilots driven by federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the Company\u2019s regional flying. For example, the FAA\u2019s expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards, including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1,500 total flight hours, as well as the FAA\u2019s revised pilot flight and duty time rules, effective January 2014, have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers. The decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking U.S. military from which to hire qualified pilots, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition, and also require the Company to reduce regional carrier flying.\nIf a significant disruption occurs to the Company\u2019s regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the Company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business relies extensively on third-party service providers. Failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in the Company\u2019s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the Company, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company has engaged third-party service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business, including regional operations, operation of customer service call centers, distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology infrastructure and services, transmitting or uploading of data, provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs, provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft\nfueling operations, and catering services, among other vital functions and services. The Company does not directly control these third-party service providers, although it does enter into agreements with most of them that define expected service performance. Any of these third-party service providers, however, may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the Company, may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their services, or the agreements with such providers may be terminated. For example, flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via third-party GDSs may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the Company and GDS operators. Such disruptions, including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation, may cause the Company\u2019s flight information to be limited or unavailable for display, significantly increase fees for both the Company and GDS users and impair the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers and travel agencies. The failure of any of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers to perform their service obligations adequately, or other interruptions of services, may reduce the Company\u2019s revenues and increase its expenses, prevent the Company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand. In addition, the Company\u2019s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.\nOrders for new aircraft typically must be placed years in advance of scheduled deliveries, and changes in the Company\u2019s route network over time may make aircraft on order less economic for the Company, but any modification or termination of such orders could result in material liability for the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft, and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial. At December 31, 2017, the Company had firm commitments to purchase 228 new aircraft from The Boeing Company (\u201cBoeing\u201d) and Airbus S.A.S (\u201cAirbus\u201d), as well as related agreements with engine manufacturers, maintenance providers and others. At December 31, 2017, the Company\u2019s commitments relating to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and other related obligations aggregated to a total of $22.2 billion.\nSubsequent to the Company placing an order for new aircraft, the Company\u2019s route network may change, such that the aircraft on order become less economic to operate flights in the Company\u2019s network. As a result, the Company\u2019s preference for a particular aircraft that it has ordered, often years in advance, may be decreased or eliminated. If the Company were to seek to modify or terminate its existing aircraft order commitments, it may be responsible for material obligations to its counterparties arising from any such change. However, the Company expects that any such change that it makes would be in the long-term best economic interest of the Company.\nThe Company could experience adverse publicity, harm to its brand, reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident, catastrophe, or incident involving its aircraft or its operations, the aircraft or operations of its regional carriers or the aircraft or operations of its codeshare partners, which may result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial position.\nAn accident, catastrophe, or incident involving an aircraft that the Company operates, or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the Company\u2019s regional carriers, or an incident involving the Company\u2019s operations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company if such accident, catastrophe, or incident created a public perception that the Company\u2019s operations, or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers, are not safe or reliable, or are less safe or reliable than other airlines. Such public perception could, in turn, result in adverse publicity for the Company, cause harm to the Company\u2019s brand and reduce travel demand on the Company\u2019s flights, or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers.\nIn addition, any such accident, catastrophe, or incident could expose the Company to significant tort liability. Although the Company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the Company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe, and the Company\u2019s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the Company for their operations, if the Company\u2019s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of\nanother carrier to indemnify it, the Company could incur substantial losses from an accident, catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial position.\nIf we experience changes in, or are unable to retain, our senior management team or other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge, including our senior management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key employees, or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, our business may be adversely affected.\nHigh and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s strategic plans, operating results, financial position and liquidity.\nAircraft fuel is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and is one of its single largest operating expenses. The timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources, as well as related service and delivery infrastructure. Although the Company has some ability to cover short-term fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations, it can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the Company\u2019s system. The Company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices.\nAircraft fuel has historically been the Company\u2019s most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel. Market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due to a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. These factors include changes in global crude oil prices, the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand, natural disasters, prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure. Prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors that may potentially impact fuel supply or demand balance, such as geopolitical events, economic growth indicators, fiscal/monetary policies, fuel tax policies, environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets. Both actual changes in these factors, as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels in short periods of time.\nGiven the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, the Company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices, especially if these increases are significant, rapid and sustained. Further, any such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable, may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the Company\u2019s strategic growth and investment plans for the future. In addition, decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity, increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general. If fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly, there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment.\nTo protect against increases in the market prices of fuel, the Company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements. However, the Company\u2019s hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions, including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. To the extent that the Company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such hedge contracts may limit the Company\u2019s ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. If fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the Company enters into a hedge contract, the Company may be required to post collateral (margin) beyond certain thresholds. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the Company\u2019s hedging arrangements.\nAdditionally, deterioration in the Company\u2019s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future.\nUnion disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance.\nUnited is a highly unionized company. As of December 31, 2017, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 89,800 active employees, of whom approximately 80% were represented by various U.S. labor organizations.\nThere is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the Company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups. There is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns, work-to-rule campaigns, sick-outs or other actions designed to disrupt the Company\u2019s normal operations, in an attempt to pressure the Company in collective bargaining negotiations. Although the RLA makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to self-help, and the Company can seek injunctive relief against premature self-help, such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined. In addition, collective bargaining agreements with the Company\u2019s represented employee groups increase the Company\u2019s labor costs, which increase could be material for any applicable reporting period.\nAn outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nAn outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand, travel behavior, or travel restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExtensive government regulation could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight. Compliance with U.S. and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the Company. Laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges, both domestically and internationally, have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue.\nUnited provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT. If the DOT altered, amended, modified, suspended or revoked these certificates, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The FAA regulates the safety of United\u2019s operations. United operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. In 2014, the FAA\u2019s more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under Part 117 of the Federal Aviation Regulations took effect, which has increased costs for all carriers. Additionally, minimum qualifications took effect for air carrier first officers. These regulations will continue to impact the industry and the Company for years to come, as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots, while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire. Although this is an industry issue, it directly affects the Company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying, as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability. From time to time, the FAA also issues orders, airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the Company. These FAA orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the FAA identifies design, manufacturing, maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action. These FAA directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nIn 2018, the U.S. Congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the FAA, which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues. As with previous reauthorization legislation, the U.S. Congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact the Company\u2019s operations and costs.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated ATC system utilized by the U.S. government. During peak travel periods in certain markets, the current ATC system\u2019s inability to handle ATC demand has led to short-term capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic. In addition, the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth. Imposition of these ATC constraints on a long-term basis may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized ATC system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nAccess to landing and take-off rights, or \u201cslots,\u201d at several major U.S. airports and many foreign airports served by the Company are, or recently have been, subject to government regulation. Certain of the Company\u2019s major hubs are among the most congested airports in the United States and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and/or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day. The FAA may limit the Company\u2019s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports, which could affect the Company\u2019s ownership and transfer rights, and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The FAA historically has taken actions with respect to airlines\u2019 slot holdings that airlines have challenged; if the FAA were to take actions that adversely affect the Company\u2019s slot holdings, the Company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots. If slots are eliminated at an airport, or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport, the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace (e.g., the New York City metropolitan region airspace) and could significantly impact the Company\u2019s operations. Further, the Company\u2019s operating costs at airports, including the Company\u2019s major hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the Company may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. Such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the Company\u2019s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nMany aspects of the Company\u2019s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws protecting the environment. Future environmental regulatory developments, such as climate change regulations in the United States and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry. In addition, there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of GHGs by the aviation industry. The precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the Company are difficult to predict, but the financial impact to the Company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant.\nSee Part I, Item 1, Business-Industry Regulation, of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the Company.\nExtensive government regulation on international routes could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the United States and other countries may be subject to change. Applicable arrangements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised, and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change. The Company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements, regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes, the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes, the airports at which carriers may operate international flights, or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports. Any further limitations, additions or modifications to such arrangements, regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. Additionally, a change in law, regulation or policy for any of the Company\u2019s international routes, such as Open Skies, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition from revenue-sharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the Company\u2019s business and assets on the Open Skies routes. The Company\u2019s plans to enter into or expand U.S. antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable U.S. federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied.\nSee Part I, Item 1, Business-Industry Regulation, of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the Company.\nThe airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and joint ventures or due to consolidations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new joint ventures. Carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances, slot swaps and/or joint ventures. Certain types of airline joint ventures further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes, pool revenues and costs, and enjoy other mutual benefits, achieving many of the benefits of consolidation. \u201cOpen Skies\u201d agreements, including the agreements between the United States and the EU and between the United States and Japan, may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers. Movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for joint ventures and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment. There is ongoing speculation that further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future, especially if new \u201cOpen Skies\u201d agreements between Brazil and the United States are fully implemented. The Company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position, including current and potential alliances, asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities. If other airlines participate in such activities, those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities, thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the Company and potentially impairing the Company\u2019s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships.\nInsufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and business.\nThe Company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations, including aircraft lease and debt financings, leases of airport property and other facilities, and other material cash obligations. In addition, the Company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s cash flows from operations and its available capital, including the proceeds from financing transactions, have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date, the Company\u2019s future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this report, including, but not limited to, substantial volatility in the price of fuel, adverse economic conditions, disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events.\nIf the Company\u2019s liquidity is materially diminished due to the various risk factors noted in this report, or otherwise, the Company might not be able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations. Certain of these covenants require the Company or United, as applicable, to maintain minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The Company\u2019s or United\u2019s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including the overall industry revenue environment, the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of the collateral.\nIf the Company does not timely pay its leases and debts or comply with such covenants, a variety of adverse consequences could result. These potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements, withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers, loss of undrawn lines of credit, the occurrence of one or more events of default under the relevant agreements, the acceleration of the maturity of debt and/or the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated. In addition, an event of default or acceleration of debt under certain of its financing agreements could result in one or more events of default under certain of the Company\u2019s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions.\nFurthermore, insufficient liquidity may limit the Company\u2019s ability to withstand competitive pressures and downturns in the travel business and the economy in general.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial level of indebtedness and non-investment grade credit rating, as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, may make it difficult for the Company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\nSee Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report for additional information regarding the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nIncreases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event, including aircraft accidents. The Company maintains insurance policies, including, but not limited to, terrorism, aviation hull and liability, workers\u2019 compensation and property and business interruption insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance with acceptable terms or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the Company experiences, whether due to insurance market conditions, policy limitations and exclusions or otherwise, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry.\nDue to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year, which are periods of lower travel demand. The Company\u2019s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality, but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal, including, among others, the imposition of excise and similar taxes, extreme or severe weather, ATC congestion, geological events, natural disasters, changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, general economic conditions and other factors. As a result, the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\nThe Company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its long-lived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company is required to test its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In addition, the Company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.\nThe Company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to, among other factors, extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit markets, a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets, unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment, as well as other uncertainties. The Company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period. The value of the Company\u2019s aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the Company or other carriers. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of UAL common stock, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nAs of December 31, 2017, UAL reported consolidated federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $2.4 billion.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). An ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation\u2019s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will not experience a future ownership change under Section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards. Potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of UAL common stock, including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of any convertible debt that UAL may issue in the future, the repurchase of such debt with UAL common stock, any issuance of UAL common stock for cash, and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5% or more of UAL common stock, or a combination of such transactions, may increase the possibility that the Company will experience a future ownership change under Section 382.\nUnder Section 382, a future ownership change would subject the Company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. This limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Any unused annual limitation may, subject to certain limits, be carried over to later years, and the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased by built-in gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change. This limitation could cause the Company\u2019s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the Company\u2019s NOL carryforwards to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. The Company\u2019s NOL carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full.\nThe final impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be materially different from our current estimates.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act introduced significant changes to the Code. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate as a result of Tax Act, the estimated impact of the new law is based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based upon our further analysis of the new law.\nOur significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.\nAn important part of our strategy to expand our global network includes making significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expanding our commercial relationships with these carriers. In 2015, we made a $100 million investment in Azul Linhas A\u00e9reas Brasileiras S.A. (\u201cAzul\u201d) and enhanced our commercial arrangements with Azul. We expect to continue exploring similar non-controlling investments in, and entering into joint ventures, commercial agreements, loan transactions and strategic alliances with, other carriers as part of our global business strategy. These transactions and relationships (including our strategic partnership with, and investment in, Azul) involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we may not receive repayment of invested funds, that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. These events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nIn addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. While we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. We may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Furthermore, our relationships with these carriers may be subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions in which these carriers are located or conduct business. Any political or regulatory change in these jurisdictions that negatively impact or prohibit our arrangements with these carriers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. To the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 91103, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "UAL"}
