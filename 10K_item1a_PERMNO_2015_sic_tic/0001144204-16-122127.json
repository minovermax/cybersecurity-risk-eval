{"cik": "749038", "company": "CONCURRENT COMPUTER CORP/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are various material risks we currently face. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the trading prices of our common stock and other securities we may issue in the future could decline significantly. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nThe risk factors below contain forward-looking statements regarding Concurrent. Actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 42.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA significant portion of our revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, concentrated in a small number of customers and our customer base may be subject to further consolidation. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining or expanding relationships with these customers or lose any of these customers, our business will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unsuccessful in maintaining key relationships with existing customers, if our existing customers\u2019 purchasing levels are reduced or they choose to upgrade their services with solutions from our competitors, or if our existing customers\u2019 capital expenditure cycles are interrupted due to consolidation, our business will be materially adversely affected. Further, if we are unsuccessful in establishing relationships with other large companies or experience problems in any of our systems, our ability to attract new customers and sell additional products to existing customers will be materially adversely affected.\nDue to our limited customer base and the relative size of each customer compared to Concurrent, our customers may make extensive demands on our business. Such demands may include high levels of contractual service, product-improvement obligations and severe price pressure. In addition, our failure to adequately perform under these contracts could result in liquidated damages. The payment of any liquidated damages or failure to meet our customers\u2019 expectations could substantially harm our future business prospects.\nWe typically do not have written agreements that require customers to purchase fixed minimum quantities of our products. Our sales to specific customers tend to, and are expected to continue to, vary from year-to-year, depending on such customers\u2019 budgets for capital expenditures and new product introductions. Further, such expenditures may be reduced, delayed or cancelled as a result of global economic conditions, the performance of each of these customers\u2019 businesses, and the impact of changes in capital spending cycles.\nIn North America, service providers have widely adopted video services over the past decade. Many will be reluctant to change vendors as systems are upgraded due to the integration into their network, and some may opt for internally-developed solutions. In addition, we may focus on smaller service providers in order to expand market penetration and increase revenue and these opportunities may require more sales and marketing resources while resulting in smaller relative order sizes. As a result, future opportunities for new sales of content delivery solutions into these markets may be challenging and/or limited.\nWe depend on a small number of domestic cable multiple system operators (\u201cMSOs\u201d) for a substantial proportion of our domestic revenues. Any decrease or delay in capital spending for advanced technologies harms our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe capital spending patterns of our existing and potential customers are dependent on a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7 annual budget cycles;\n\u00b7 technology adoption cycles and network architectures of service providers, and evolving industry standards that may impact them;\n\u00b7 changes in general economic conditions;\n\u00b7 changes in spending relative to consolidation activities;\n\u00b7 changes in strategic focus;\n\u00b7 competitive pressures, including pricing pressures; and\n\u00b7 discretionary customer spending patterns.\nWe expect these sales to continue to constitute a substantial proportion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Demand for our products will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by service providers on advanced technologies for constructing and upgrading their network infrastructure. Further demand will also depend on customers\u2019 continuing to upgrade and expand their offerings with our solutions. Continued slowdowns or delays in this spending would likely have a material adverse impact on our quarterly revenues and could result in net losses.\nA loss of our government contracts and/or orders would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from the supply of systems under government contracts and/or orders. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $9.7 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in revenue to U.S. Government prime contractors and agencies of the U.S. Government. These sales represent approximately 16% and 19% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Government business is subject to many risks, such as delays in funding, reduction or modification of contracts or subcontracts, changes in governmental policies or regulations which could significantly increase the cost of doing business with the government and the imposition of budgetary constraints. Many governments are struggling to balance their budgets which could further reduce funding for contracts. A loss of government contract revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and sequestration (automatic, across-the-board U.S. Government budgetary spending cuts) currently required under the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 continues to have potential adverse consequences on our future business.\nU.S. Government spending priorities and Department of Defense spending levels continue to be uncertain and difficult to predict and may be affected by numerous factors, including whether sequestration is currently required under the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and quantifying it actual impact on the Department of Defense budget and other programs. A shift in U.S. Government spending priorities, or a reduction in total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on our future business.\nIf the U.S. Government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience further delayed orders, delayed payments, declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nSales to the U.S. Government, prime contractors and agencies of the U.S. Government represented between 16% and 19% of our total revenues in each of the past 2 fiscal years and our expected revenue for fiscal year 2017 and beyond depends, in part, on receiving a similar level of new orders from the U.S. Government, which remains uncertain and difficult to predict. If the U.S. Government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments, declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows. All of the aforementioned conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial outlook, our operating results and our financial condition.\nIf revenues forecasted for a particular period are not realized in such period due to the lengthy, complex and unpredictable sales cycles of our products, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows for that or subsequent periods will be adversely affected.\nThe sales cycles of our products are typically lengthy, complex and unpredictable and usually involve:\n\u00b7 a significant technical evaluation period;\n\u00b7 a significant commitment of capital and other resources by service providers;\n\u00b7 substantial time required to engineer the deployment of our products;\n\u00b7 substantial time and expense testing and qualifying new technologies; and\n\u00b7 substantial time and expense deploying new technologies into their networks.\nFor these and other reasons, our sales cycles are generally between 6 and 18 months, but can last longer. If orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows for that quarter or subsequent quarters could be substantially lower than anticipated. Our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly due to revenue recognition rules and the timing of the receipt of customer orders. Additionally, service revenues such as installation services associated with product sales are impacted by such delays.\nWe are exploring strategic alternatives, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any strategic alternative or that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for stockholders.\nWe have commenced a review of strategic alternatives which could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture, partnering or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions, or continuing to operate with our current business plan and strategy. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot assure that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nIf we fail to develop and market new products and product enhancements in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur future success is dependent on our development and marketing of new products and solutions that enhance our current products and achieve market acceptance. In addition, services, products or technologies developed by others may render one or more of our products or technologies uncompetitive, unmarketable or obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products, including development of new applications for our technology, and to develop and introduce new products to meet and adapt to changing customer requirements and emerging technologies. Our failure to respond or respond quickly enough to rapidly changing technologies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our efforts to trim expenses in research and development could have the unintended consequence of impacting our delivery of new products or enhancements to existing products. Our inability to develop, on a timely basis, new products or enhancements to existing products, or the failure of such new products or enhancements to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have invested, and will continue to invest, in new storage solutions. The failure of these products to gain market acceptance within the timeframes we expect or the failure of these products to perform well in field deployments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, delays in product or feature availability may impact our ability to address market opportunities. Performance problems in lab or field deployments could adversely impact our reputation in new storage markets. Better financed or more established competitors could prevent our entry into, or limit our success, in these new markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing our new storage products.\nWe are continuing to adapt our content delivery products to add features allowing deployments to cable, IPTV, and Internet CDN providers to enable multi-screen video delivery. The changes require new knowledge sets, especially in research and development, and will require us to develop and sell new products to new customers. A failure to execute on this transition, or execute quickly enough, will adversely affect our business.\nOur video expertise for more than fifteen years has been focused on the VOD market. Although we have been successful in VOD, we recognize it is a relatively limited market and, as such, we are transitioning the business to serve video to all devices. We are introducing the products necessary to serve these new markets. We have also invested in new sales professionals to help us sell our existing and new products to a wider customer set. We believe that these steps are necessary, but that they will be expensive. We are making these investments in a challenging macroeconomic environment and may be unable to develop or sell any new marketable products. In addition, we face robust competition both from internally-developed solutions and from large, well-positioned companies. If we are not successful in establishing new products and new customers, we will have expended considerable effort and capital to transition the business and will not have received any economic benefit.\nWe cannot guarantee that our products and services will keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards, address the changing needs of our customers or achieve market acceptance, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in enhancing our current and planned content delivery, storage and real-time products or developing, integrating and marketing new products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. In addition, services, products or technologies developed by others may render one or more of our products or technologies uncompetitive, unmarketable or obsolete. Future technological advances may result in the availability of new products and services that could compete with our solutions or reduce the cost of existing products or services. Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products, including development of new applications for our technology, and to develop and introduce new products to meet and adapt to changing customer requirements and emerging technologies. Further, announcements of currently planned or other new product offerings by our competitors may cause customers to defer purchase decisions or to fail to purchase our existing solutions. Our failure to respond to rapidly changing technologies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBroadband Internet video services for televisions have gained traction and could replace or dilute revenue associated with current VOD services and limit or eliminate our service provider customers\u2019 interest in our content delivery products.\nA number of well-funded companies have launched services and are or will be capable of delivering Internet video services for home television viewing. As these products are developed, successfully deployed and embraced by consumers, our customers may discontinue purchases of our content delivery products.\nWe have experienced competitive pricing pressure for our products and services and expect to continue to experience this pressure. As pricing pressures continue, it may impact our revenue and call into question our ability to achieve and maintain profitability.\nOver the years, our industry has experienced a decrease in average selling prices. We anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will continue to decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures, increased sales discounts and new product introductions by our competitors. We may experience substantial decreases in future operating results, financial condition and cash flows due to a decrease of our average selling prices. We also anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the mix of products we sell in any given period. If our sales of lower margin products significantly expand in future quarterly periods, our overall gross margin levels, operating results, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely impacted.\nWe incurred net losses in the past and may incur further losses in the future.\nWe incurred net losses of $11.1 million, $0.2 million, $2.9 million, $3.3 million and $1.0 million in fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $189.3 million. We may have difficulty sustaining profitable operations and incur additional net losses in the future.\nWe have taken and continue to take measures to address the variability in the market for our products and services, which could have long-term negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address an increase in customer demand.\nWe have taken and continue to take measures to address the variability in the market for our products and services, to increase average revenue per unit of our sales and to reduce our operating expenses, rationalize capital expenditure and minimize customer turnover. We cannot ensure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and services, to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete, to operate effectively, to operate profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand. These measures may have long-term negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical and operational talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and services, making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle.\nIf we are unable to manage change in our operations effectively, our business may be harmed through a diminished ability to monitor and control effectively our operations, and a decrease in the quality of work and innovation of our employees.\nOur ability to successfully offer new products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management. In light of the growing complexities in managing our portfolio of products and services, our anticipated future operations may strain our technical, operational and administrative resources. A failure to manage changes in our volume of business may harm our business through a decreased ability to monitor and control effectively our operations, and a decrease in the quality of products and innovation of our employees upon which our business is dependent. If we fail to meet customers\u2019 supply expectations, we could incur penalties, our revenue would be adversely affected and we may lose business, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nAny weaknesses identified in our system of internal controls by us or our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. We have reported material weaknesses in our financial reporting controls during the last three fiscal years. In future periods, we may identify deficiencies in our system of internal controls over financial reporting that may require remediation. There can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified may not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods. Any control deficiency that we may identify in the future could adversely affect our stock price, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with the trend of increased stockholder activism.\nPublicly-traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. Given our market capitalization and other factors, it is possible that stockholders may in the future attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe utilize open source software, which could enable our competitors to gain access to our source code and distribute it without paying any license fee to us.\nKey components of our content delivery, storage and real-time products utilize open source software on Linux platforms. Some open source software, especially that provided under the GNU Public License, is provided pursuant to licenses that limit the restrictions that may be placed on the distribution and copying of the provided code. Thus, it is possible that customers or competitors could copy portions of our software and freely distribute it. This could substantially impact our business and our ability to protect our products and future business.\nWe rely on a combination of contracts and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur expenses to enforce our rights. Our business could also be adversely affected if we are found to be infringing on the intellectual property of others.\nWe typically enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and vendors, in an effort to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization. The steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, and the agreements we enter into may not be enforceable. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries.\nOur competitors or other companies may currently own or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that might prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Further, we have indemnification obligations with numerous customers that could require us to become involved in intellectual property litigation. As a result, we may be found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us or against a customer to which we have an indemnification obligation, our business and operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAny litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u00b7 obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u00b7 redesign products or services that incorporate the disputed technology.\nIf we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, we could face substantial costs and our business could be seriously harmed. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nIn addition, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties in the future for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors. These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel and there can be no guarantee of success in any such action. As a result, our operating results could suffer and our financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\nProtecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. While piracy may adversely affect U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is likely to be more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenues may be impacted if our intellectual property is copied or otherwise misappropriated and we are not able to successfully assert our rights over our intellectual property. We may be unable to close sales if our intellectual property is copied; we may face increased competition if our trade secrets are disclosed; and our reputation may be negatively impacted if our company or product names are misused. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights, making enforcement more difficult. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe markets for content delivery, storage and real-time products are extremely competitive. Our competitors include divisions of larger public companies with an established presence in the industry, as well as well-funded start-ups. Further, as we expand the addressable markets for our product offerings, we encounter a different set of competitors. This intense competition has negatively impacted our content delivery solutions revenues and may severely impact our success and ability to earn additional revenue through expanding our content delivery solutions offerings.\nA list of the primary competitors we face in both of our markets and a categorization of our competitors is included under the Competition heading in Part I, Item 1., the Business section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nWe have a significant base of deployed content delivery products that our customers, over time, may decide to replace for products from other companies.\nA significant number of our on-demand products have been deployed for several years and may be replaced with newer products or technologies. When our customers evaluate replacing those older products, they may choose a different vendor. If that were to occur, we would lose future revenue opportunities from expansion as well as maintenance revenue.\nContinuing uncertainties in the domestic and global economies may reduce demand for our products and services.\nThe ongoing uncertainty and unevenness in the recovery in the domestic and global economy may negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and operating results. The uncertainty in economic conditions in many of our markets may impact demand for our products and render budgeting and forecasting difficult. The difficulty in forecasting demand increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements, which may cause us to over-produce finished goods, resulting in inventory impairments, or under-produce finished goods, affecting our ability to meet customer requirements.\nOur operating results, financial condition and cash flows may vary based on changes in our customers\u2019 capital expenditures. We sell our solutions primarily to large organizations whose businesses fluctuate with general economic and business conditions. As a result, decreased demand for our solutions and services caused by a weakening global economy may cause a decline in our revenue. Historically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in corporate spending. In the future, potential customers may decide to reduce their budgets for capital expenditures by deferring or reconsidering product purchases, which would negatively impact our operating results, financial results and cash flows.\nIn some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, which entails several risks, including the possibility of defective parts, a shortage of components, an increase in component costs, and reduced control over delivery schedules.\nOur reliance on single suppliers entails a number of risks, including the possibility of defective parts, a shortage of components, increase in components costs, and reduced control over delivery schedules. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We estimate that a lead-time of 12-16 weeks may be necessary to switch to an alternative supplier of certain custom application specific integrated circuit and printed circuit assemblies. A change in the supplier of these components, without the appropriate lead-time, could result in a material delay in shipments by us of certain products. Where alternative sources are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies of components from such sources may also result in delays. Shipping delays may also result in a delay in revenue recognition, possibly outside the fiscal period originally planned, and, as a result, may adversely affect our financial results for that particular period. See the Supplier heading in Part I, Item 1., the Business section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nA large number of our maintenance contracts are for legacy systems that are aging and may be replaced.\nA large percentage of the services we provide are to customers who run our legacy hardware and systems. Over time, these systems will be replaced and the customers may not choose to purchase replacement systems from us. In such a case, our service revenue will be materially negatively impacted.\nSales to international customers accounted for approximately 40%, 46% and 42% of our revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Accordingly, our business is susceptible to numerous risks associated with international operations.\nWe are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that could increase our costs, lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u00b7 compliance with, and unexpected changes in, regulatory requirements resulting in unanticipated costs and delays;\n\u00b7 difficulties in compliance with export and re-export regulations governing U.S. goods and goods from our international subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 lack of availability of trained personnel in international locations;\n\u00b7 challenges in dealing with international channel partners;\n\u00b7 tariffs, export controls and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7 longer accounts receivable payment cycles than in the U.S.;\n\u00b7 potential difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables in some foreign legal systems;\n\u00b7 potential difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7 the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;\n\u00b7 general economic and political conditions in international markets, including the impact of the U.K\u2019s departure from the European Union; and\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur efforts to maintain channels to market and sell our products internationally may not be successful.\nOur international sales are supported by a combination of direct sales in certain international locations and indirect channel sales through distributor and reseller arrangements with third parties in others. We may not be able to maintain productive reseller and/or distribution agreements and/or may not be able to successfully manage these sales channels. In addition, many of our resellers also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products and may choose to focus on products of those vendors. Additionally, our ability to utilize an indirect sales model in these international markets will depend on our ability to qualify and train those resellers to perform product installations and to provide customer support. If we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers, or if these resellers do not succeed in their sales efforts (whether because they are unable to provide support or otherwise), we may be unable to grow or sustain our revenue in international markets.\nProduct failures or interruptions could cause delays in shipments, require design modifications or field replacement, which may have a negative impact on our business and damage our reputation and customer relationships.\nProduct failures may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Despite our own testing, vendor testing and additional testing by current and potential customers, all errors or failures may not be found in our products prior to being deployed or, if discovered, successfully corrected in a timely manner. These errors or failures could cause delays in product introductions and shipments or require design modifications that could adversely affect our competitive position. Further, some errors may not be detected until the systems are deployed. In such a case, we may have to undertake substantial field replacement programs to correct the problem including the shipment of replacement parts. Our reputation may also suffer if our customers view our products as unreliable, whether based on actual or perceived errors or failures in our products.\nIn addition, a defect, error or performance problem with content delivery products could cause our customers\u2019 offerings to fail for a period of time or be degraded. Any such failure would cause customer service and public relations problems for our customers. As a result, we could experience delayed or lost revenue due to adverse customer reaction, negative publicity regarding us and our products and services and claims for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Any claim could be expensive and require us to spend a significant amount of resources. In circumstances where third-party technology incorporated with or in our systems includes a defect, error or performance problem or fails for any reason, we may have to replace such third-party technology at our expense and be responsible to our customers for their corresponding claims. Such tasks could be expensive, could require us to spend a significant amount of resources and insurance coverage, if available, may be inadequate.\nTrends in our business may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate; therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful.\nWe have experienced significant variations in the revenue, expenses and operating results from quarter-to-quarter in our business, and it is likely that these variations will continue. We believe that fluctuations in the number of orders for our products being placed from quarter-to-quarter are principally attributable to the buying patterns and budgeting cycles of our customers. In addition, sales cycles associated with the purchase of many of our products are typically lengthy and orders are often not finalized until the end of a quarter. As a result, our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate in accordance with this purchasing activity. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful. In addition, because these factors are difficult for us to forecast, our business, financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters may be adversely affected and below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could result in material declines of our stock price.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to retain our current key personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace, or fail to attract additional qualified personnel.\nOur future performance depends on the continued service of our senior management, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may fail to retain our key employees or to attract or retain other highly qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could seriously impact our business, especially the loss of highly specialized technical personnel. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly skilled managerial, technical, sales, marketing and customer support personnel. In addition, new employees frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.\nAs our products age, we may not be able to purchase necessary parts to support legacy systems currently deployed or to be deployed.\nWith the passage of time, suppliers of essential parts may stop producing these parts. In such cases, we may be required to redesign our products to accommodate the obsolescence. If that occurs, we will have to spend considerable effort in the redesign and, in some cases, may be forced to have the redesigned products requalified. Requalification may take several months, thereby delaying expected revenue.\nWe could be exposed to legal liability if our products were used to violate copyright laws.\nOur content delivery products enable recording, storing, and delivering video over commercial networks. Thus, our customers could use our products without first obtaining permission from content owners to record and deliver copyrighted video. In such a situation, we could face liability for claims that our products enabled or assisted in breaching copyright laws.\nIf content providers, such as movie studios, limit the scope of content licensed for use in the digital content delivery market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected because the potential market for our products would be more limited than we currently believe.\nThe success of the content delivery market is contingent upon content providers, such as movie studios, continuing to permit their content to be licensed for distribution in this market. Content providers may, due to concerns regarding marketing or illegal duplication of the content, limit the extent to which they provide content to the markets served by our customers and potential customers. A limitation of available content would indirectly limit the demand for our content delivery solutions.\nOur facilities, especially our Pompano Beach, Florida facility, could be subject to severe weather that could shut down those facilities and halt production.\nAll of our facilities are, from time to time, subject to severe weather that could result in a temporary shut-down of the impacted facility. However, our Pompano Beach, Florida facility is located in South Florida where there is a high risk of hurricanes. A hurricane could shut down the Pompano Beach facility for extended periods thereby making it impossible for us to assemble and ship real-time products. Further, an extended shut-down could slow the release of software products for our real-time business since most of the developers for those products are located at that facility.\nA failure to detect fraud in the business could be serious.\nWe have observed an increase in minor instances of attempted fraud in the business, including unauthorized use of company credit cards and unauthorized banking transactions. While we are confident that we have comprehensive controls in place, there can be no assurances that all business fraud will be detected and/or thwarted. A loss related to fraud, especially an uninsured loss, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Industries\nThe cable and telecommunications industries are experiencing consolidation, which could result in delays or reductions in purchases of products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are experiencing the consolidation of many participants in the cable and telecommunications industries. When consolidations occur, it is possible that the acquirer will not continue using the same suppliers, possibly resulting in an immediate or future elimination of sales opportunities and future support revenue. Even if sales are not reduced, consolidation can also result in pressure from customers for lower prices or better terms, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased, the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired or other factors. Consolidations could also result in delays in purchasing decisions by the affected companies prior to completion of the transaction and by the merged businesses. The purchasing decisions of the merged companies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to governmental regulation. Any finding that we have been or are currently in noncompliance with such laws could result in, among other things, governmental penalties or class action lawsuits. Further, changes in existing laws or new laws may adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to various international, U.S. federal, state and local laws affecting our content delivery, storage and real-time product lines. The television industry is subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and other countries. Our content delivery solutions revenue is dependent upon the continued growth of the digital television industry in the U.S. and internationally. Broadband companies are subject to extensive government regulation by the FCC and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The 1984 Cable Act, which amended the Communications Act of 1934, established policies in the areas of ownership, channel usage, franchise provisions and renewals, subscriber rates and privacy, obscenity and lockboxes, unauthorized reception of services, equal employment opportunity, and pole attachments. The 1984 Cable Act also defined jurisdictional boundaries among federal, state and local authorities for regulating cable television systems which, among other provisions, allow for expanded regulatory powers when domestic cable penetration exceeds a threshold of 70% of U.S. households. Additional regulations could have the effect of limiting capital expenditures by our customers and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were found to be, or believed to be non-compliant with privacy laws, we could face substantial exposure to government fines or privacy litigation. In addition, new \u2018net neutrality\u2019 legislation or regulations could be implemented or interpreted in a way that curtails certain of our products\u2019 uses within our customers\u2019 data networks and adversely impacts our customers\u2019 ability to operate those networks efficiently or profitably. This could impact our sales of those products. The enactment by federal, state or international governments of new laws or regulations could adversely affect our customers, and thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our real-time revenue is also subject to strict government regulation as the result of the government work we do. The regulations deal with security clearances, privacy, employment practices, pricing, purchasing, intellectual property and integrity. If we were ever found in violation or if out of compliance, our production and resultant revenues could be halted or significantly delayed.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by continuing economic uncertainty in Europe and elsewhere and by related global economic conditions.\nThe lingering effects of the European debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the European currencies, including the euro, to further deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of our European customers. One potential outcome of the European financial situation is the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries or the dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. The potential dissolution of the euro, or market perceptions concerning this and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, the European crisis has contributed to instability in global credit markets. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, remain uncertain, persist, or deteriorate further, consumer purchasing power and demand for our products could decline, and we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to liability if private information supplied to our customers is misused.\nOur content delivery solutions allow companies to collect and store data that many viewers may consider confidential. Unauthorized access or use of this information could result in liability to our customers, and potentially us, and might deter potential on-demand viewers. We have no control over the policy of our customers with respect to the access to this data and the release of this data to third parties.\nOther Risks\nFluctuations in our future effective tax rates could affect our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are required to periodically review our deferred tax assets and determine whether, based on available evidence, a valuation allowance is necessary. Accordingly, we have performed such evaluation, from time to time, based on historical evidence, trends in profitability, expectations of future taxable income and implemented tax planning strategies. Further, although we benefit from net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S., some of our foreign subsidiaries do not have such net operating losses, exposing us to tax liabilities in various countries.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. In the event we determine that it is appropriate to create a reserve or increase an existing reserve for any such potential liabilities, the amount of the additional reserve is charged as an expense in the period in which it is determined. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment for the applicable period, a further charge to expense in the period such short fall is determined would result. Such a charge to expense could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations for the applicable period.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we released $13.7 million of valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we reestablished $12.5 million of valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets and as of June 30, 2016, our U.S. deferred tax assets are fully reserved. Changes to our business in the future may require a release of our valuation allowances, which would result in additional tax benefits that would improve our net income. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nWe have implemented certain anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe are subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination involving a merger or sale of more than 10% of our assets with any stockholder, including affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s stock except under limited circumstances.\nThere are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that also may delay, deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control.\nAdditionally, see the risk factor below that discusses our Tax Asset Preservation Plan adopted on March 1, 2016 designed to limit our exposure to an ownership change and as further discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or present other challenges, such as integration issues, for our business, which if not successfully resolved would adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We periodically review investments in new businesses, and we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, or assume contingent liabilities. These actions could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Acquisitions also entail numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or services;\n\u00b7 unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7 adverse effects on existing business relationships;\n\u00b7 risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future. Our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture issuances or repurchases of our equity, or transfers of our equity by third parties, may impair our future ability to use a substantial amount of our existing net operating loss carryforwards.\nFrom time to time we complete an analysis of the ownership changes in our stock pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of June 30, 2016, the ownership change was 27.7%, compared to 24.2% (revised from 29.7%) as of June 30, 2015. Future transactions and the timing of such transactions could cause an additional ownership change for Section 382 income tax purposes. Section 382 limits the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of its common stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses or deductions, as of the ownership change date, that are recognized during the five-year period after the ownership change. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to, additional repurchases or issuances of common stock, or acquisitions or sales of shares of Concurrent stock by certain holders of our shares, including persons who have held, currently hold or may accumulate in the future five percent or more of our outstanding common stock for their own account. Most of these transactions are beyond our control. If an additional ownership change were to occur for purposes of Section 382, we would be required to calculate a new annual restriction on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Despite the reestablishment of a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal year 2016, we could lose all or a substantial part of the benefit of our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards if an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 does occur.\nOn March 1, 2016, we announced the adoption of a Tax Asset Preservation Plan (\u201cTAPP\u201d) designed to limit the Company\u2019s exposure to an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382. Such a change would severely limit the Company\u2019s ability to use its net loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes. There is no guarantee that the TAPP will prevent the Company from experiencing an ownership change and losing all or a substantial part of the benefit of the accumulated net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe currently intend to propose an amendment to our certificate of incorporation at our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders that would establish ownership limitations designed to preserve the value of our net operating loss carryforwards in a manner similar to the TAPP. If our stockholders vote against this amendment, we may once again lose our ability to utilize all or a substantial portion of the benefit of our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nTo date, the majority of our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of our international expenses are incurred in the local currencies of countries in which we operate. Because a portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates specifically the Japanese yen, euro and British pound. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we often sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase local currency operating costs. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted-average exchange rate. If the U.S. dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies noted above, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses, and net income could significantly fluctuate. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, the high and low prices reported on the NASDAQ Global Market were $6.65 and $4.54, respectively. Further, as of August 25, 2016, the closing price as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market was $5.08. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others:\n\u00b7 variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u00b7 the development of the content delivery market in general;\n\u00b7 the investment in storage and Linux markets;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 announcement by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions;\n\u00b7 consolidation of companies that comprise our target market;\n\u00b7 suspension, reduction or cancellation of the quarterly dividend; and\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general, the NASDAQ Global Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In some cases, these fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating performance.\nIn the past, class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of those companies\u2019 common stock. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA sustained period of low stock price brings with it a risk that our stock will not comply with the minimum trading-price rules of the NASDAQ Global Market, and may be subject to delisting, thus significantly impacting the liquidity of our stock and our access to public capital.", "PERMNO": 51829, "SIC": 6500, "TIC": "CCUR"}
