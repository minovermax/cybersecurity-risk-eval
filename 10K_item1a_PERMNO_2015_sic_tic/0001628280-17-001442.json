{"cik": "931015", "company": "POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC/MN", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nA significant adverse determination in any material product liability claim against us could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nThe manufacture, sale and usage of our products expose us to significant risks associated with product liability claims. If our products are defective or used incorrectly by our customers, bodily injury, property damage or other injury, including death, may result and this could give rise to product liability claims against us or adversely affect our brand image or reputation. Any losses that we may suffer from any product liability claims, and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products, may have a negative impact on our business and operating results.\nBecause of the high cost of product liability insurance premiums and the historically insignificant amount of product liability claims paid by us, we were self-insured from 1985 to 1996 and from 2002 to 2012. From 1996 to 2002, and beginning again in 2012, we purchased excess insurance coverage for catastrophic product liability claims for incidents occurring subsequent to the policy date that exceeded our self-insured retention levels. The estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to expense when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable.\nWe had a product liability reserve accrued on our balance sheet of $45.1 million at December 31, 2016 for the probable payment of pending claims related to product liability litigation associated with our products. We believe such accrual is adequate. We do not believe the outcome of any pending product liability litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations. However, no assurance can be given that our historical claims record, which did not include ATVs prior to 1985, motorcycles and side-by-side vehicles prior to 1998, and Global Adjacent Markets vehicles prior to 2011, will not change or that material product liability claims against us will not be made in the future. Adverse determination of material product liability claims made against us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nSignificant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe provide limited warranties for our vehicles. We may also provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. We also provide a limited emission warranty for certain emission-related parts in our ORVs, snowmobiles, and motorcycles as required by the EPA and CARB. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer.\nHistorically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. For example, in April 2016, we issued a voluntary recall for certain RZR 900 and 1000 off-road vehicles manufactured since model year 2013 due to reports of thermal-related incidents, including fire, and in September 2016, we issued a voluntary recall for certain RZR XP Turbo off-road vehicles due to similar thermal-related incidents. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products.\nOur business may be sensitive to economic conditions that impact consumer spending.\nOur results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions, primarily in North America and Europe, that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Weakening of, and fluctuations in, economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, capital markets, tax rates, savings rates, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, the impacts of natural disasters and acts of terrorism and other matters, including the availability of consumer credit, could reduce overall consumer spending or reduce consumer spending on powersports and aftermarket products. A general reduction in consumer spending or a reduction in consumer spending on powersports and aftermarket products could adversely affect our sales growth and profitability. Overall demand for products sold in the Jeep and truck aftermarket is dependent upon\nmany factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the United States, the total number of registered vehicles in the United States, the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the United States. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have a financial services partnership arrangement with a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that requires us to repurchase products financed and repossessed by the partnership, subject to certain limitations. For calendar year 2016, our maximum aggregate repurchase obligation was approximately $182.8 million. If adverse changes to economic conditions result in increased defaults on the loans made by this financial services partnership, our repurchase obligation under the partnership arrangement could adversely affect our liquidity and harm our business.\nTermination or interruption of informal supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe have informal supply arrangements with many of our suppliers. In the event of a termination of the supply arrangement, there can be no assurance that alternate supply arrangements will be made on satisfactory terms. If we need to enter into supply arrangements on unsatisfactory terms, or if there are any delays to our supply arrangements, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIncreases in the cost of raw material, commodity and transportation costs and shortages of certain raw materials could negatively impact our business.\nThe primary commodities used in manufacturing our products are aluminum, steel, petroleum-based resins and certain rare earth metals used in our charging systems, as well as diesel fuel to transport the products. Our profitability is affected by significant fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials and commodities we use in our products. We may not be able to pass along any price increases in our raw materials to our customers. As a result, an increase in the cost of raw materials, commodities, labor or other costs associated with the manufacturing of our products could increase our costs of sales and reduce our profitability.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and net earnings.\nThe changing relationships of the United States dollar to the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, the Euro, the Swiss franc, the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen and certain other foreign currencies have from time to time had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets, the costs we incur to import certain components for our products, and the translation of our foreign balance sheets. While we actively manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange hedging contracts from time to time, these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, and any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged.\nWe face intense competition in all product lines, including from some competitors that have greater financial and marketing resources. Failure to compete effectively against competitors would negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe markets we operate in are highly competitive. Competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors, including price, quality, reliability, styling, product features and warranties. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors, including sales and marketing support programs (such as financing and cooperative advertising). Certain of our competitors are more diversified and have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than ours, which allow these competitors to invest more heavily in intellectual property, product development and advertising. If we are not able to compete with new products or models of our competitors, our future business performance may be materially and adversely affected. Internationally, our products typically face more competition where certain foreign competitors manufacture and market products in their respective countries. This allows those competitors to sell products at lower prices, which could adversely affect our competitiveness. In addition, our products compete with many other recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers and, to a lesser extent, with other vehicles designed for utility applications. A failure to effectively compete with these other competitors could have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nWe manufacture our products at, and distribute our products from, several locations in North America and internationally. Any disruption at any of these facilities or manufacturing delays could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe manufacture most of our products at 18 locations, including North American and international facilities. We also have several locations that serve as wholegoods and PG&A distribution centers, warehouses and office facilities. In addition, we have agreements with other third-party manufacturers to manufacture products on our behalf. These facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events. In the event that one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a disaster or other event, we could be forced to shift production to one of our other manufacturing facilities. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory, and therefore, may adversely affect our net sales and operating results. Any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers, and our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and preferences, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nOne of our growth strategies is to develop innovative, customer-valued products to generate revenue growth. Our sales from new products in the past have represented a significant component of our sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future sales. We may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products in the global markets in which we compete. Product development requires significant financial, technological and other resources. While we expended $185.1 million, $166.4 million and $148.5 million for research and development efforts in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, there can be no assurance that this level of investment in research and development will be sufficient to maintain our competitive advantage in product innovation, which could cause our business to suffer. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels and we may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products. Our competitors\u2019 new products may beat our products to market and be more attractive with more features and/or less expensive than our products.\nWe depend on suppliers, financing sources and other strategic partners who may be sensitive to economic conditions that could affect their businesses in a manner that adversely affects their relationship with us.\nWe source component parts and raw materials through numerous suppliers and have relationships with a limited number of product financing sources for our dealers and consumers. Our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected if deterioration of economic or business conditions results in a weakening of the financial condition of a material number of our suppliers or financing sources, or if uncertainty about the economy or the demand for our products causes these business partners to voluntarily or involuntarily reduce or terminate their relationship with us.\nWe intend to grow our business through potential acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances and new joint ventures and partnerships, which could be risky and could harm our business.\nOne of our growth strategies is to drive growth in our businesses and accelerate opportunities to expand our global presence through targeted acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances, and new joint ventures and partnerships that add value while considering our existing brands and product portfolio. The benefits of an acquisition, non-consolidating investment, new joint venture or partnership may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances, joint ventures or partnerships will ultimately produce any benefits.\nThere can be no assurance that acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions pose risks with respect to our ability to project and evaluate market demand, potential synergies and cost savings, make correct accounting estimates and achieve anticipated business goals and objectives. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. If acquired businesses do not achieve forecasted results or otherwise fail to meet projections, it could affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions present a number of integration risks. For example, the acquisition may: disrupt operations in core, adjacent or acquired businesses; require more time than anticipated to be fully integrated into our operations and systems; create more costs than projected; divert management attention; create the potential of losing customer, supplier or other critical\nbusiness relationships; and pose difficulties retaining employees. The inability to successfully integrate new businesses may result in higher production costs, lost sales or otherwise negatively affect earnings and financial results.\nOur products are subject to extensive United States federal and state and international safety, environmental and other government regulation that may require us to incur expenses or modify product offerings in order to maintain compliance with the actions of regulators and could decrease the demand for our products.\nOur products are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to safety, environmental and other regulations promulgated by the United States federal government and individual states as well as international regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines, increased expenses to modify our products and harm to our reputation, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, future regulations could require additional safety standards or emission reductions that would require additional expenses and/or modification of product offerings in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. Our products are also subject to laws and regulations that restrict the use or manner of use during certain hours and locations, and these laws and regulations could decrease the popularity and sales of our products. We continue to monitor regulatory activities in conjunction with industry associations and support balanced and appropriate programs that educate the product user on safe use of our products and how to protect the environment.\nFailure to establish and maintain the appropriate level of dealers and distributor relationships or weak economic conditions impacting those relationships may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe distribute our products through numerous dealers and distributors and rely on them to retail our products to the end customers. Our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected if deterioration of economic or business conditions results in a weakening of the financial condition of a material number of our dealers and distributors. Additionally, weak demand for, or quality issues with, our products may cause dealers and distributors to voluntarily or involuntarily reduce or terminate their relationship with us. Further, if we fail to establish and maintain an appropriate level of dealers and distributors for each of our products, we may not obtain adequate market coverage for the desired level of retail sales of our products.\nRetail credit market deterioration and volatility may restrict the ability of our retail customers to finance the purchase of our products and adversely affect our income from financial services.\nWe have arrangements with each of Performance Finance, Sheffield Financial and Synchrony Bank to make retail financing available to consumers who purchase our products in the United States. During 2016, consumers financed approximately 33 percent of the vehicles we sold in the United States through these installment retail credit programs. Furthermore, some customers use financing from lenders who do not partner with us, such as local banks and credit unions. There can be no assurance that retail financing will continue to be available in the same amounts and under the same terms that had been previously available to our customers. If retail financing is not available to customers on satisfactory terms, it is possible that our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Our income from financial services is also affected by changes in interest rates.\n( Our reliance upon patents, trademark laws, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products and may lead to costly litigation.\nWe hold patents and trademarks relating to various aspects of our products, such as our patented \u201con demand\u201d all-wheel drive, and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or trademarks or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In the absence of enforceable patent or trademark protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, gain access to our trade secrets and know-how or diminish our brand through unauthorized use of our trademarks, all of which could adversely affect our business. Others may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or if we initiate proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Regardless of whether litigation relating to our intellectual property rights is successful, the litigation could significantly increase our\ncosts and divert management\u2019s attention from operation of our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also cannot be certain that our products or technologies have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty.\nOur international operations require significant management attention and financial resources, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting, and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of sales and profitability.\nApproximately fourteen percent of our total sales are generated outside of North America, and we intend to continue to expand our international operations. Expanding international sales and operations is a part of our long-term strategic objectives. To support that strategy, we must increase our presence outside of North America, including additional employees and investment in business infrastructure and operations. International operations and sales are subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers, the impact of foreign government laws and regulations and United States laws and regulations that apply to international operations, and the effects of income and withholding taxes, governmental expropriation and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international operations and sales that could cause loss of revenues and earnings. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our total sales, financial condition, profitability or cash flows. Violations of laws that apply to our foreign operations, such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nThe results of the November 2016 United States elections have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. We have sourcing and manufacturing operations in international locations. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported products or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanging weather conditions may reduce demand and negatively impact net sales and production of certain of our products.\nLack of snowfall in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect snowmobile retail sales and related PG&A sales in that region. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or other factors, our sales may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. There is no assurance that weather conditions or natural disasters could not have a material effect on our sales, production capability or component supply continuity for any of our products.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and trade names could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Our determination of whether goodwill impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units\u2019 fair market value with its carrying value. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant and long-term adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, and/or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could negatively impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding and must comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nOur credit agreement and other debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds or take advantage of business opportunities. While we are currently in compliance with the financial covenants, increases in our debt or decreases in our earnings could cause us to fail to comply with these financial covenants. Failing to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and debt service capability.\nOur level of debt and the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement could have important consequences on our financial position and results of operations, including increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because debt under our credit agreement bears interest at variable rates.\nAdditional tax expense or tax exposure could impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other business taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the earnings generated in these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, a change in our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates and changes in tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\nOur operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled employees, including skilled labor. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and promote skilled personnel for all areas of our organization.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nWe use many information technology systems and their underlying infrastructure to operate our business. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Recent acquisitions have resulted in additional decentralized systems that add to the complexity of our information technology infrastructure. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we have invested in layers of data and information technology protection, and continually monitor cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent disruptions or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 75182, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "PII"}
