We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements are included below.\nRisk Factor Summary\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainties. Below is a summary of the risk factors that may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial performance, stock price, results of operations, operating flexibility, reputation, costs or liabilities. In addition to this summary and the more detailed description of each risk factor that immediately follows this summary, you should carefully consider the information included in other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K, including but not limited to Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties,\u201d Items 7. and 7A. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d (MD&A) and Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d prior to investing in our securities. However, the risk factors described herein are not all of the risks we may face. Other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business if they occur and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. Moreover, new risks emerge from time to time. Further, our business may also be affected by general risks that apply to all companies operating in the United States (U.S.) and globally, which have not been included.\nFinancial risks\n\u2022Fluctuations or extended material declines in the market prices of the commodities we produce;\n\u2022Less flexibility due to our debt and other financial commitments;\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any future public health crisis;\n\u2022Changes in or failure to comply with financial assurance requirements relating to our mine closure reclamation obligations; and\n\u2022Unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation, changes in income tax laws or other contingencies.\nInternational risks\n\u2022Geopolitical, economic and social uncertainties and risks for our international operations, including in Indonesia, Peru and Chile; and\n\u2022Failure of PT-FI to meet its commitments to achieve the extension of PT-FI\u2019s IUPK through 2041.\nOperational risks\n\u2022Operational risks inherent in mining, including underground mining;\n\u2022Environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks associated with management of waste rock and tailings;\n\u2022Environmental challenges associated with our Indonesia mining operations;\n\u2022Violence, civil and religious strife, and activism;\n\u2022Availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies for our mining operations, including future expansions or development projects;\n\u2022Fluctuations in price and availability of commodities we purchase as well as constraints on supply and logistics, and transportation services; and\n\u2022Disruptions, damage, failure and implementation and integration risks associated with information technology systems.\nHuman capital risks\n\u2022Failure to maintain good relations with our workforce and labor disputes or labor unrest; and\n\u2022Ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel.\nRisks related to development projects and mineral reserves\n\u2022Inherent risks associated with development projects and unique risks associated with development of underground mining;\n\u2022Ability to replace mineral reserves depleted by production; and\n\u2022Inherent uncertainty associated with estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources.\nRegulatory, environmental and social risks\n\u2022Compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations;\n\u2022Remediation of properties no longer in operation;\n\u2022Ability to meet our energy requirements while complying with greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) regulations and other energy transition policy changes;\n\u2022The physical impacts of climate change on our operations, workforce and supply chain;\n\u2022Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, performance and disclosures; and\n\u2022Failure or perceived failure to manage relationships with the communities and/or Indigenous Peoples where we operate or that are near our operations.\nRisks related to our common stock\n\u2022Holding company structure impact on our ability to service debt, declare cash dividends or repurchase shares; and\n\u2022Impact of anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law.\nFinancial risks\nFluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our common stock. Extended material declines in the market prices of such commodities could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum. Extended material declines in market prices of such commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our assets, may depress the price of our common stock, and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, repay our debt and meet our other obligations. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting negative impact on the global economy created significant volatility in the financial markets, including the copper market. Copper prices were initially impacted by economic uncertainty; however, in mid-2020 copper prices began to rise and reached a record high during 2021, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nFluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions; international regulatory, trade and/or tax policies, including national tariffs; commodities investment activity and speculation; interest rates; expectations regarding future inflation rates; the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. Volatility in global economic growth, particularly in developing economies, has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities. Geopolitical uncertainty and protectionism, have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence, which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, copper prices may be affected by demand from China, which is currently the largest consumer of refined copper in the world for infrastructure, the growing markets for automobiles and appliances and by the global focus on a transition to new technologies for clean energy, to advance communications and to enhance public health, as well as demand from North America, Europe, and Asian countries other than China. Additional factors affecting gold prices may include purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from China and India, two of the world\u2019s largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold. For additional information regarding the historical fluctuations of the prices of copper, gold and molybdenum, refer to \u201cMarkets\u201d in MD&A.\nIf market prices for the primary commodities we produce were to materially decline and remain low for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing or modifying our mining and processing operations, as we had to do in early 2020 in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur losses, and those losses may be material.\nDeclines in prices of commodities we sell could also result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived assets. Refer to Note 4 for additional information regarding metals inventory adjustments recorded for the three years ended December 31, 2021. Other events that could result in impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on current and future expected mine production costs.\nOur debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2021, our total consolidated debt was $9.5 billion (see MD&A and Note 8) and our total consolidated cash and cash equivalents was $8.1 billion. We also have various other financial commitments, including reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. For further information, see the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations. Although we have been successful in repaying debt in the past, refinancing our bank facilities, and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. See the risk factor below regarding increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders, including creditors, with respect to our ESG practices, performance and disclosures. In addition, we or our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases or in pursuing other business opportunities.\nOur level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following:\n\u2022Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and regulatory conditions;\n\u2022Limiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate requirements and/or material contingencies, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt;\n\u2022Requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or\n\u2022Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments.\nAny failure to comply with the financial and/or other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. Our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default.\nAs of January 31, 2022, our senior unsecured debt was rated \u201cBaa3\u201d with a stable outlook by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, \u201cBBB-\u201d with a stable outlook by Fitch Ratings, and \u201cBB+\u201d with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor\u2019s. If we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects deteriorate, our current credit ratings could be downgraded, which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt, our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any future major public health crisis may have an adverse impact on our business.\nSince early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets throughout the world. The extent and duration of adverse impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic (including new and emerging strains and variants) or any future major public health crisis may have on our operations and business, including demand for the commodities we produce, and on global financial markets remains uncertain. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions. Despite our efforts to manage the impacts of the pandemic, there can be no assurance that our actions will be effective in containing and mitigating the risk of spread or a major outbreak of COVID-19 (or any future major public health crisis) at our operating sites. Additionally, although several vaccines for COVID-19 have been approved, there are risks that these vaccines will not be effective against new and emerging strains and variants of the virus and that these vaccines may not be widely available or accepted in the areas in which we operate. A major outbreak of COVID-19 (or any future major public health crisis) at any of our operating sites, and particularly at PT-FI\u2019s remote operating site, could disrupt or change our operating plans, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nActions taken by governmental authorities and third parties to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of COVID-19 (and those that may be taken for any future major public health crisis) have impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business. For example, in mid-March 2020, the Peru government issued a Supreme Decree and declaration of a National Emergency in its efforts to contain the outbreak of COVID-19. To comply with the government\u2019s requirements, in 2020, we temporarily transitioned our Cerro Verde mine to care and maintenance status and adjusted operations to prioritize critical activities. These and other impacts of COVID-19, or any future major public health crisis, had, or could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in or the failure to comply with the requirements of mine closure and reclamation regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. As of December 31, 2021, our financial assurance obligations totaled $1.5 billion for closure and reclamation/restoration costs of U.S. mining sites. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations and Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d for a discussion of certain of such U.S. federal and state laws and regulations applicable to Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX). A substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by FCX and subsidiary guarantees. Our ability to continue to provide guarantees depends on state and other regulatory requirements, our financial performance and our financial condition. Other forms of assurance, such as letters of credit and surety bonds, are costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties.\nPlans and provisions for mine closure and remediation may change over time due to changes in stakeholder expectations, legislation, standards, and technical understanding and techniques, which may cause our provisions for environmental and asset retirement obligations to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. For example, our implementation of the Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management (the Tailings Standard) (discussed in Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d herein) could require\nchanges to our closure and reclamation plans, although it is uncertain if these changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases. In addition, climate change could lead to changes in the physical risks posed to our operations, which could result in changes in our closure and reclamation plans to address such risks. Any modifications to our closure and reclamation plans that may be required to address physical climate risks may materially increase the costs associated with implementing closure and reclamation at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites and the financial assurance obligations related to the same. Refer to Notes 1 and 12, for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations and see the risk factor below relating to the physical impacts of climate change.\nUnanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation, changes in income tax laws or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental matters, including those described in Note 12 and in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. We are also involved periodically in other reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. From time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at \u201cSuperfund\u201d and other sites. In addition, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites, or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.\nFurther, we are a global business with operations in various jurisdictions. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the U.S. or in enforcing the judgment of a foreign court or arbitral panel against a sovereign nation. Our inability to enforce our right and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels, including against a sovereign nation, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe have significant net operating losses (NOLs) in the U.S. generated in prior years. These NOLs are available to offset future taxable income, resulting in minimal estimated tax liability in the U.S. over the next several years at current metals market prices. Changes to U.S. income tax laws and/or recommendations from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes being considered and/or implemented in countries where we operate could materially impact our income tax provision, cash tax liability, and effective tax rate. In addition, these changes may result in new limitations on our ability to benefit from our significant U.S. NOLs.\nInternational risks\nOur international operations are subject to geopolitical, economic and social risks.\nWe are a U.S.-based mining company with substantial assets located outside of the U.S. Risks of conducting business in countries outside the U.S. can include:\n\u2022Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, or the renegotiation, cancellation, revocation or forced modification (including the inherent risk of these actions being taken unilaterally by government owned entities) of contracts, leases, licenses, permits, stability agreements or other agreements and/or approvals;\n\u2022Expropriation or nationalization of property, protectionism, or restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital;\n\u2022Changes in and differing interpretations of the host country\u2019s laws, regulations and policies (which may be applied retroactively), including, but not limited to, those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, duties, tariffs, divestment, imports, exports (including restrictions on the export of copper concentrate and anode slimes, copper and/or gold), trade regulations, immigration, currency and environmental matters (including land use and water use), additional requirements on foreign operations and investment, and/or result in fines, fees and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, the risk of any of which may increase with rising \u201cresource nationalism\u201d in countries around the world;\n\u2022Geopolitical, social and economic instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil unrest, blockades, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism, certain of which may result in, among other things, an inability to access our property or transport our commodities, and in particular, our investments and operations in Peru and Chile currently may be susceptible to such risks;\n\u2022Risk of loss associated with trespass, illegal artisanal mining, theft, sabotage and vandalism;\n\u2022Risk of loss due to major public health issues, including any pandemic (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), epidemic or endemic health issues, as a result of the potential related impact to employees, disruptions to operations, supply chain delays, trade restrictions and impact on economic activity in affected countries or regions and due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain such major public health issues (see above for further discussion of our risks specific to the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u2022Changes in U.S. trade, tariff, tax, immigration or other policies that may harm relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies;\n\u2022Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;\n\u2022Foreign exchange controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and inflation; and\n\u2022Reduced protection for intellectual property rights.\nOur insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. For example, we do not have political risk insurance. Accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the U.S. may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations in the countries where we operate or do business. For example, our international operations must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. We operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anti-corruption enforcement activities, prosecutions and settlements have occurred. We have a large number of contracts with local and foreign suppliers and contractors, who may take action contrary to or fail to adopt standards, controls and procedures, including health, safety, environment, human rights and community standards, that are equivalent to our standards, controls and procedures. There can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, agents, suppliers or contractors. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law\nor governance practices. Any such breaches could result in safety events that may result in injuries or fatalities, significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation or regulatory action or inquiries, shareholder activism (such as to stop using a certain supplier or contractor), civil unrest or other adverse impacts on human rights, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe conduct international mining operations in Indonesia, Peru and Chile and exploration activities in other foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the U.S., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic, social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries. For example, we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with Indonesia and Peru tax authorities (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of these matters). Other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below.\nBecause our mining operations in Indonesia are a significant operating asset, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in Indonesia.\nMaintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesia government and PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum, also known as MIND ID), an Indonesia state-owned enterprise and shareholder in PT-FI, is important because of the significance of our Indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among Indonesia\u2019s most significant business enterprises. Partially because of the Grasberg minerals district\u2019s significance to Indonesia\u2019s economy, the environmentally sensitive area where it is located, and the number of people employed, our Indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and criticism in the Indonesia press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. Improper management of our working relationship with the Indonesia government could lead to a disruption of operations and/or impact our reputation in Indonesia and in the region where we operate, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within Indonesia, and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders, some of which have conflicted with PT-FI\u2019s contractual rights in the past. In particular, the enactment of Law No. 4 of 2009 on Coal and Mineral Mining on January 12, 2009 (the Mining Law) replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders, including PT-FI, to conduct mining activities in Indonesia under a contract of work system. Notwithstanding provisions in PT-FI\u2019s former Contract of Work (COW) prohibiting it from doing so, the Indonesia government sought to modify PT-FI\u2019s former COW to address provisions contained in the Mining Law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder, some of which were not required under or conflicted with PT-FI\u2019s former COW.\nIn early 2017, the Indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. PT-FI\u2019s export license for copper concentrate is valid for one year periods, subject to review and approval by the Indonesia government every six months, depending on greenfield smelter development progress. PT-FI\u2019s export license expires on March 15, 2022. Refer to MD&A and Note 12 for further discussion of the administrative fine levied by the Indonesia government on PT-FI for failing to achieve physical development progress on the greenfield smelter, and ongoing discussions with the Indonesia government regarding a deferred schedule for the completion of the greenfield smelter in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The 2017 regulations also permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for PT Smelting (PT-FI\u2019s 39.5-percent-owned copper smelter and refinery located in Gresik, Indonesia) to continue operating. PT Smelting\u2019s export license for anode slimes expires on December 9, 2022, subject to review and approval by the Indonesia government every six months. In addition to a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes in 2017, PT Smelting\u2019s operations were shut down from mid-January 2017 until early March 2017 as a result of labor disturbances. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled over 10 percent of our consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We cannot predict when and if PT-FI\u2019s copper concentrate export license and PT Smelting\u2019s anode slimes export license may be renewed. PT-FI\u2019s sale of concentrates could be interrupted if either of these export license is not timely renewed or if PT Smelting is unable to operate either due to other operational or financial constraints, which would adversely impact our revenues and operations.\nWe cannot assure you that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in Indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed, or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPT-FI will not mine all of the ore reserves in the Grasberg minerals district before the initial term of its IUPK expires in 2031. PT-FI\u2019s IUPK may not be extended through 2041 if PT-FI fails to abide by its terms and conditions and applicable laws and regulations.\nOn December 21, 2018, PT-FI was granted an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041, subject to, among other things, PT-FI\u2019s completion of construction of additional domestic smelting capacity totaling 2 million metric tons of concentrate per year by the end of 2023 (an extension of which has been requested due to COVID-19 mitigation measures subject to the approval of the Indonesia government), and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. Refer to Note 13 for a summary of the IUPK\u2019s key fiscal terms. The expansion of PT Smelting is expected to be complete in late 2023 and the construction of the greenfield smelter is expected to be completed as soon as feasible in 2024, which is subject to, among other things, no additional COVID-19 related disruptions.\nThe IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay duties on concentrate exports of 5 percent, declining to 2.5 percent when development progress for additional smelting capacity in Indonesia exceeds 30 percent, and eliminated when development progress for additional smelting capacity in Indonesia exceeds 50 percent. Refer to MD&A and Note 12 for further discussion of the administrative fine levied by the Indonesia government on PT-FI for failing to achieve physical development progress on the greenfield smelter, and ongoing discussions with the Indonesia government regarding a deferred schedule for the completion of the greenfield smelter in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe preliminary capital cost estimate for the greenfield smelter and related precious metal refinery approximates $3 billion. In July 2021, PT-FI entered into a $1.0 billion, five-year, unsecured bank credit facility to advance its Indonesia smelter projects and is currently arranging additional debt financing for these projects. PT-FI\u2019s ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, and future market prices as well as PT-FI\u2019s operational performance, cash flows and debt position, among other factors. Financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to PT-FI. See the risk factor below regarding increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders, including creditors, with respect to our ESG practices, performance and disclosures.\nOur proven and probable mineral reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and PT-FI\u2019s current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041. As a result, PT-FI will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the IUPK. Prior to the end of 2031, we expect to mine 48 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves at December 31, 2021, representing 53 percent of our net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 55 percent of our net equity share of recoverable gold reserves.\nIf PT-FI does not complete the construction of additional domestic smelting capacity totaling 2 million metric tons of concentrate per year by the end of 2023 (an extension of which has been requested due to COVID-19 mitigation measures subject to the approval of the Indonesia government), or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government as set forth in the IUPK, the IUPK may not be extended from 2031 through 2041, and PT-FI would be unable to mine all of the proven and probable mineral reserves in the Grasberg minerals district, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOperational risks\nOur mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our underground mining operations have higher risks than a surface mine.\nWe have assets in a variety of geographic locations, all of which exist in and around broader communities and environments. Maintaining the operational integrity and performance of our assets is crucial to protect our people, the environment and communities in which we operate. Our mines are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. These operational risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, wildfires and other natural disasters; environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals; surface or underground fires; equipment failures; accidents, including in connection with mining\nequipment, milling equipment or conveyor systems, transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites (including where these services are provided by third parties such as vehicle and aircraft transport); wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; underground water and ore management; lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates; and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, workplace entry and travel restrictions may result in the delay of key personnel or external consultants accessing our sites to undertake inspections or other activities, potentially resulting in unidentified asset integrity.\nFor a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management, see the risk factor below relating to our management of waste rock and tailings.\nWe are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of some of our open-pit mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. No assurances can be given that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may or may not occur, nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures, in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as seismic activity or severe weather, which may lead to floods, mudslides, pit-wall instability, and possibly even slippage of material. In early 2019, our El Abra operation in Chile experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms. As a result, our operating results for 2019 were impacted by a suspension of El Abra\u2019s crushed leach stacking operations for approximately 35 days. We cannot predict whether similar events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect this, or any of our other operations.\nOur business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. Underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous, and in May 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at the Grasberg minerals district when the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility collapsed. No assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.\nWe experience mining induced seismic activity from time to time in the Grasberg minerals district. We cannot predict whether additional occurrences of seismic activity or other unexpected geological activity will occur that could cause schedule delays or additional revisions to PT-FI\u2019s mine plans, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia mining operations involve additional risks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of Indonesia. These conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. The area also receives extreme rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. Further, the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time.\nWe maintain insurance at amounts we believe to be reasonable to cover some of these risks and hazards; however, our insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from certain natural or operating disasters. No assurance can be given that such insurance will continue to be available, or that it will be available at economically feasible premiums, or that we will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance. We may elect to not purchase insurance for certain risks due to the high premium costs associated with insuring such risk or for various other reasons. We do not have coverage for certain environmental losses and other risks. The lack of, or insufficiency of, insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development of and production from mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, significant repair costs, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, extensive community disruption (including short- and long-term health and safety risks), loss of licenses, permits or necessary approvals to operate, loss of workforce confidence, loss of infrastructure and services, disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. Further, the impacts of any serious incidents that occur may also be amplified if we fail to respond timely or in an appropriate manner.\nOur management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business.\nThe waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material. Managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability, geochemistry, water quality and dust generation. Management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to comply with applicable national, state and local laws, permits and approved environmental impact studies.\nWe maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material. Tailings impoundments include large embankments that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse. Our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions, and we must effectively monitor, prevent and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. In Indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to the environmental challenges at our Indonesia mining operations.\nSubsidiaries of our company currently operate 16 active tailings storage facilities (14 in the U.S. and 2 in Peru), of which 11 have an upstream design and 5 have a centerline design. We also manage 52 tailings storage facilities in the U.S. that are inactive or closed (45 with an upstream design, 5 with a centerline design and 2 with a downstream design) and another 5 with an upstream design that are deemed \u201csafely closed\u201d according to the definition in the Tailings Standard. In 2021, we produced approximately 295 million metric tons of tailings. The failure of tailings and other embankments at any of our mining operations could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life, as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation. Many of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings and a limited number of impoundments are in areas where a failure has the potential to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure. As a result, our programs take into account the significant consequences resulting from potential failure modes, and we dedicate substantial financial resources and internal and external technical resources to pursue the safe management of all those facilities reducing and in some cases eliminating the number of and potential consequences of credible failure modes. Our tailings management and stewardship program involves qualified external Engineers of Record and periodic oversight by independent tailings Technical Review Boards and our Tailings Stewardship Team. We continue to enhance our existing practices to strengthen the design, operation and closure of tailings storage facilities in an effort to reduce the risk of severe or catastrophic failure of those facilities. However, no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future. For additional information regarding the company\u2019s tailings management and stewardship program, including the Tailings Standard, refer to Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d herein.\nIn addition, changes to the physical risks to our facilities resulting from climate change could lead to changes in our plans for managing tailings and waste rock in order to address such risks, which may materially increase the costs associated with managing waste rock and tailings at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites. For further discussion, see the below risk factor relating to the physical effects of climate change.\nBased on observations from tailings failures at unaffiliated mines, in addition to fatalities and severe personal, property and environmental damages, these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, decrease in mineral reserves, legal liability, government investigations, additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure, increased monitoring costs and production costs, increased insurance costs or inability to obtain insurance, increased costs and/or limited access to capital, remediation costs, inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications, evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nOur Indonesia mining operations have the potential to create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in Indonesia environmental laws could increase our costs.\nMining operations on the scale of our Indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of tailings. In 2021, PT-FI produced approximately 52 million metric tons of tailings. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Indonesia government, uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an\nengineered deposition area in the lowlands. Lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands.\nAnother major environmental challenge at PT-FI is managing overburden, which is rock that was required to be moved aside in the open pit mining process to reach the ore in the Grasberg open pit. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. In addition, specific overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area. The Grasberg overburden stockpiles have experienced erosion over time. This overburden affects the volume as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment material deposited in the lowlands tailings management area, which can result in environmental impacts. PT-FI\u2019s current designated tailings deposition management plan as well as robust environmental monitoring programs take into account the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area.\nAs part of its ongoing management and monitoring program, PT-FI expanded the scope of its analyses to assess possible impacts to the environment and human health from overburden erosion and tailings, including conducting and updating a human health risk assessment. During 2021, PT-FI continued to advance work on the human health risk assessment to evaluate these potential impacts. A study conducted by third-party expert consultants with PT-FI support, assessed potential exposure pathways including surface waters, groundwaters, sediments and soils, dust and terrestrial and aquatic tissues. PT-FI continues further study and evaluation and, in furtherance of this effort, has been assisting local health authorities with a community health survey, which is providing further data to evaluate any potential impacts from operations and information on community health conditions. The ongoing study and evaluation, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022, will assist in determining what additional monitoring and mitigation efforts may be required in the future.\nIn the past, the Indonesia government has raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management. Our Indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area; such that, a pipeline system would be difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. Based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system for all mine tailings is feasible.\nOvertopping or levee failure induced by extreme weather events is a potential risk. Additionally, unanticipated structural failure of the levee system in the future could result in flooding of the nearby communities and related loss of lives and/or severe personal, property and environmental damages. This may necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, financial assistance to the communities impacted, and remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social, cultural and economic impacts.\nManaging these environmental challenges at our Indonesia operations could result in reputational harm and increased costs that could be significant.\nIn December 2018, Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices at PT-FI\u2019s operations, including initiatives that will examine options to potentially increase tailings retention and to evaluate large scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. LAPI-ITB, the third-party expert nominated by MOEF to perform the framework evaluation, submitted their report to the MOEF in June 2021. PT-FI is currently evaluating additional actions and activities based on the study conclusions. In addition, MOEF finalized environmental permitting related to the underground rail facilities and Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) production of 80 thousand metric tons per day in November 2021. Permitting of certain facilities for underground mining production operations, as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands, continues to progress.\nWe cannot assure you that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in Indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed, or that new interpretations of existing Indonesia environmental laws and regulations will not be issued, which could have a significant impact on PT-FI.\nViolence, civil and religious strife, and activism could result in loss of life and disrupt our operations.\nIndonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. Several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located. In Papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesia military and police. In addition, illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities. Social, economic and political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our Indonesia operations.\nStarting in 2009, a series of shooting incidents occurred within the PT-FI project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations. Since 2009, there have been 22 fatalities and more than 75 injuries to our employees, contractor employees, government security personnel and civilians. Shooting incidents in PT-FI\u2019s project area have continued on a sporadic basis through January 2021, when a helicopter contracted to PT-FI was fired upon and struck by a single gunshot in an area adjacent to the project area. There were several shooting incidents in the first half of 2020, including an incident near a PT-FI office building where one employee was killed and two others injured. In addition, in December 2018, a mass shooting incident targeting a highway construction crew occurred in a remote mountain area approximately 100 miles east of the PT-FI project area, resulting in at least 19 fatalities and several were reported as missing. Separatist security incidents, including shootings, continue to occur regionally. PT-FI actively monitors security conditions and the occurrence of incidents in the region.\nThe safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and PT-FI continues to work with the Indonesia government to enhance security and address security issues within the PT-FI project area and in nearby areas. Although we have implemented measures and safeguards consistent with both international standards and our own internal standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights, the implementation of these measures and safeguards does not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. We continue to limit the use of the road leading to PT-FI\u2019s mining and milling operations to secured convoys, including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas.\nWe cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could result in loss of life, disruption or suspension of PT-FI\u2019s operations. If other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time.\nSouth America countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. Since 2019, both Peru and Chile have experienced significant civil unrest unrelated to our operations. For example, in fourth-quarter 2021, an unaffiliated copper producer in southern Peru announced the suspension of its operations after repeated and sustained community protests on the government-designated concentrate transport route along public roads, which constrained the operation from shipping its product. Although such civil unrest has not significantly impacted our results, similar events in the future could cause our South America operations to be materially impacted, in which case, we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest will occur in the future in Peru or Chile.\nOur mining operations, including future expansions or developments, depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies.\nWe recognize that access to clean, safe and reliable water supplies is vital to the health and livelihood of our host communities. Our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our approach. We aim to balance our operational water requirements with those of the local communities, environment and ecosystems. Most of our North America and South America mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant, and where climate change may lead to increasing scarcity of water resources in the future. Continuous production at our mines and any future expansions or developments are dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. Current and long-term water risks include those that arise from our operations (such as failure to properly manage tailings and overburden) and events that we do not control (such as extreme weather and other physical risks associated with climate change). For further discussion of the physical impacts of climate change, see the related risk factor below.\nAs discussed in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d in Arizona, where our operations use both surface water and groundwater, we are a participant in an active adjudication in which Arizona courts have been attempting, for over 45 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the Gila River watershed, one of the state\u2019s largest river systems. If we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications, water uses could be diminished or curtailed, and our operations at Morenci, Safford and Sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources.\nWater for our Cerro Verde operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of Arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant constructed by us. As a result of occasional drought conditions, temporary supply shortages that could affect our Cerro Verde operations are possible.\nWater for our El Abra mining operation in Chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascot\u00e1n aquifer. In 2010, El Abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascot\u00e1n aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. Our current permit will expire in 2029 unless we are able to renew it again. The agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer water levels and select flora species to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping. If impact occurs, reductions in pumping are required to restore water levels, which could have an adverse effect on production from El Abra. For further discussion, see the risk factor above relating to the geopolitical, economic and social risks associated with our international operations.\nAlthough we typically have sufficient water for our Indonesia operations, the area receives considerable rainfall that makes us susceptible to periodic floods and mudslides, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted.\nAlthough each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, as discussed above, the availability of additional supplies for potential future expansions or development will require additional investments and will take time to develop, if available. While we are taking actions to acquire additional back-up water supplies, such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost, or at all, so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, and the ability to obtain future water supplies could prevent future expansions or developments, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations.\nFluctuations in the price and availability of commodities we purchase and constraints on supply and logistics could affect our profitability. Further, significant delays or increases in costs affecting transportation services may affect our business.\nPrices and availability of commodities consumed or used in our operations such as natural gas, diesel, ammonium nitrate, chemical reagents, and steel-related products can affect the costs of production at our operations. These prices fluctuate and can be volatile and any cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In 2021, we experienced price increases on certain commodities, including fuel, steel, ammonia and acid. While these increases did not significantly impact our results in 2021, additional increases may occur in 2022 and such increases may be material.\nEnsuring continuity of supply of materials to our operations is critical to our business. We also rely on the availability of components from suppliers for key machines and equipment, which may be impacted by competition demands as well as the availability of input materials in the creation of such equipment. A supplier\u2019s failure to supply materials or components in a timely manner or to meet our quality, quantity, cost requirements or our technical specifications, or our inability to obtain alternative sources of materials or components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could adversely affect our operations. In 2021, we experienced longer lead times on delivery of certain materials and shortages on certain materials, including lubricants, semi-conductors, personal protective equipment, rubber and acid. While these delays and shortages did not significantly impact our results in 2021, these issues may continue in 2022 and such shortages and delays may be material.\nOur business depends on the inbound transportation of commodities we use and the outbound transportation of the commodities we produce by truck, rail and ocean freight. The COVID-19 pandemic has created global shipping and logistics challenges. Any significant increase in the cost of the transportation of these commodities or products, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, or otherwise, would adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if the transportation service providers fail to deliver commodities used in our operations to us or the commodities we produce to our customers in a timely manner or at all, such failure could\nadversely impact our ability to meet our production schedules, delay our projects and capital initiatives, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems may be adversely affected by disruptions, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nOur industry has become increasingly supported by and dependent on digital technologies. Our strategy of operating large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated. Many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations, improve safety and efficiency, and lower costs.\nAs our dependence on information systems, including those of our third-party service providers and vendors, grows, we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. In recent years, cybersecurity events have increased in frequency and magnitude. These incidents may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, ransomware, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other advanced and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats, including threats that increasingly target critical operational technologies and process control networks. If any of these threats materialize, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, production downtimes, communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations, unauthorized release of proprietary, commercially sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information, a misappropriation or loss of funds, the corruption of data, significant health and safety consequences, environmental damage, loss of intellectual property, fines and litigation, damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity events in the past and may experience them in the future. While these cybersecurity events did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our day-to-day operations, as of January 31, 2022, there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses or interruption in the future. Given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity events from materializing. Further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. System modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nHuman capital risks\nLabor disputes or labor unrest could disrupt our operations.\nOur business is dependent on maintaining good relations with our workforce. A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Refer to Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 31 percent of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 14 percent of our global labor force was covered by agreements that will or were scheduled to expire during 2022.\nLabor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. If we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations. For example, during third-quarter 2016, PT-FI experienced labor productivity issues and a 10-day work stoppage, which continued during fourth-quarter 2016 and into the first half of 2017. Beginning in mid-April 2017, PT-FI experienced a high level of worker absenteeism, which unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates, and in May 2017, a significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action. These employees were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under existing Indonesia laws and regulations resulting in increased costs associated with employee severance. In third-quarter 2020, we experienced a five-day labor-related work stoppage related to COVID-19 travel restrictions when a small group of workers at PT-FI staged protests and a blockade restricting access to the main road to the mining operations area. We reached an amicable resolution with the group of workers while upholding our COVID-19 safety protocols. There were no strikes or lockouts at any of our operations in 2021.\nWe cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur. Significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel.\nOur success is dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. Our business depends upon our ability to attract, retain and develop a qualified, inclusive and diverse workforce. Our ability to attract qualified personnel is affected by the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages. If we fail to attract, retain and develop qualified, inclusive and diverse personnel necessary for the efficient operation of our business, this could result in decreased profitability, productivity and efficiency, which may have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nRisks related to development projects and mineral reserves\nDevelopment projects are inherently risky and may require more capital and have lower economic returns than anticipated, and the development of our underground mines are also subject to other unique risks.\nMine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Our development projects include underground development activities at the Grasberg Block Cave, DMLZ and Kucing Liar ore bodies in the Grasberg minerals district, which currently constitute approximately 28 percent of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves and 94 percent of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable gold reserves. There are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including, but not limited to, unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions, potential delays, cost overruns, lower levels of production during ramp-up periods, shortages of material or labor, construction defects, breakdowns and injuries to persons and property.\nThe development of our underground mines are also subject to other unique risks including, but not limited to, underground fires or floods, ventilating harmful gases, fall-of-ground accidents, and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions. For example, we experience mining induced seismic activity from time to time in the Grasberg minerals district. While we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production, there is no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays, revised mine plans, injuries to persons and property, or increased capital costs, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review processes, many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control, which may cause the actual time and capital required to complete a development project to exceed our estimates.\nExploration is highly speculative, and our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries to replace mineral reserves.\nOur existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. Because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations, our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our long-term success. Depleted mineral reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, reducing operating costs that could extend the life of a mine by allowing us to cost-effectively process ore types that were previously considered uneconomic, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in mineral reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties, requires substantial capital expenditures and, in some instances, advances in processing technology, and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineral resources since new, large, long-life deposits are increasingly scarce. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably. Even if significant mineral resources are discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. We may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire mineral reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nEstimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.\nOur estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of Subpart 1300 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-K. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in mineral estimates. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on assumed long-term prices for the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and molybdenum, and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which may not necessarily be indicative of future results. Our mineral estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Geological assumptions about our mineral resources that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.\nEstimates of mineral reserves, or the cost at which we anticipate the mineral reserves will be recovered, are based on assumptions, such as metal prices and other economic inputs. Changes to such assumptions may require revisions to reserve estimates which could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results. Until mineral reserves are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only.\nIn addition, if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from assumed levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease, or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the term \u201cmineral resources\u201d does not indicate recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as defined by the SEC. Estimates of mineral resources are subject to further exploration and evaluation of development and operating costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors, and, therefore, are subject to considerable uncertainty. Mineral resources do not meet the threshold for mineral reserve modifying factors, such as engineering, legal and/or economic feasibility, that would allow for the conversion to mineral reserves. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated mineral resources not included in mineral reserves will become recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves.\nRegulatory, environmental and social risks\nThe costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities. Related permit and other approval requirements may delay or result in a suspension of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. These laws and regulations are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. As a mining company, compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is an integral and costly part of our business. In addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations.\nCertain federal and similar state laws and regulations may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations, or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we previously sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. As discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to costs incurred for remediating environmental conditions on our properties that are no longer in operation, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and certain of its affiliates. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. In addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, and other factors.\nNew or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial obligations. Regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase financial responsibility requirements for mine closure and reclamation. Adoption of such environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities. In addition, no assurances can be made that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development, constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners\u2019 shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations. The timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.\nWe are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety. Our mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under applicable mining regulations. If inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures.\nMany other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. In addition, new laws and regulations, including executive orders, or changes to or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. Any such variations could negatively impact the mining sector, including our business, substantially increase costs to achieve compliance or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor additional information regarding the various regulations affecting us, see Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years.\nFMC and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies, have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the U.S. for more than a century. Activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before American industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment.\nCompanies like FMC are now legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it. That liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of our acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. We are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had more than 100 active remediation projects in 24 U.S. states. In addition, FMC and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us.\nOur environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon:\n\u2022Our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago;\n\u2022Our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and\n\u2022Our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates.\nSignificant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material.\nIn addition, remediation standards imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. Imposition of more stringent remediation standards, particularly for arsenic and lead in soils, poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation.\nRefer to Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d and Note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations.\nWe face increasing regulatory and stakeholder expectations relating to our GHG emissions and energy transition plans, which may adversely affect our business. Further, we may not be able to timely or successfully transition from fossil fuel sources for our significant energy needs, which may result in reputational damage.\nOur operations require significant energy, much of which is currently from fossil fuel sources and is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Energy represented approximately 21 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2021, and is expected to approximate 25 percent in 2022. The principal sources of energy consumption at our mining operations are: diesel fuel, which powers mine trucks and other transportation equipment; purchased electricity, which powers core facilities and certain on-site metal processing operations; and coal and natural gas, which provides electricity at certain operations.\nExisting and proposed new governmental conventions, laws, regulations and standards (both in the U.S. and internationally), including those related to climate and GHG emissions, may in the future add significantly to our operating costs, limit or modify our operations, and require more resources to comply and remediate in response. For additional information on climate change conventions, laws, regulations and standards applicable to FCX, refer to Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d.\nIf we do not adapt to the expectations of stakeholders regarding a low-carbon future in a timely manner, it may result in reputational damage with key stakeholders impacting investor confidence, market value and access to and cost of capital. In response to climate change and societal demands for action, we have announced GHG emissions reduction targets and aspirations, which will result in additional costs to us, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve any current or future GHG emissions targets or aspirations.\nWhile we strive to transition to more renewable power sources for our mining operations, as a commercial consumer of power, our ability to reduce our GHG emissions associated with our power consumption demand is dependent upon the mix of our suppliers and locally-available renewable energy resources at our various sites. The transition to renewable and other energy sources could, among other things, increase our capital expenditures, operating and energy costs, depending on the scope, magnitude and timing of increased regulation of fossil-fuel based energy production, including GHG emissions, as well as the availability of alternative energy sources.\nIn certain aspects of our operations, our ability to reduce our GHG emissions is directly dependent on the actions of third parties and technological solutions and innovation, and our ability to make significant, rapid changes in our GHG emissions in response to potential future regulations may be limited. For example, our diesel-fueled mine trucks are a significant contributor to GHG emissions at our North America and South America operations, but reduction of emissions from mine trucks will depend upon the development of alternative-fueled mining equipment by our third-party suppliers. At our remote operations in Indonesia, we own and operate a coal-fired power plant, and our ability to transition to commercially viable alternative sources of energy will depend on, among other things, a feasibility study and technological considerations.\nThe physical impacts of climate change may adversely affect our mining operations, workforce and supply chain.\nWe recognize that as the climate changes, our operations, workforce and supply chain may be exposed to changes in the frequency, intensity and/or duration of intense storms, drought, flooding (including from sea level rise at our coastal operations), wildfire, and other extreme weather events and patterns. Such potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. At many of our mine sites, climate change is projected to impact local precipitation regimes, resulting in shorter-duration, higher-intensity storm events, and the potential for less precipitation overall. We could face increased operational costs associated with managing additional volumes of storm water during more intense future events, including supply disruption, delays and increased pricing. In addition, the potential for overall decreases in precipitation could affect the availability of water needed for our operations, leading to increased operating costs, or in extreme cases, disruptions to mining operations.\nIn addition, with respect to our tailings facilities, as part of our commitment to implementing the Tailings Standard (discussed in Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d herein), we will be required to consider uncertainties due to climate change, incorporate that assessment into the relevant knowledge base for our tailings facilities, use this knowledge base to enhance the resilience of our approach to the impacts of climate change using an adaptive management approach, incorporate that knowledge into facility operations, and take measures to mitigate both\nenvironmental impact and potential failure risks at our tailings facilities, including those arising from climate change. These obligations likely will require future changes at our tailings facilities, which could increase our operational expenses or require further capital investments.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders with respect to our ESG practices, performance, commitments and disclosures may impact our reputation, increase our costs and impact our access to capital.\nStakeholder scrutiny related to our ESG practices, commitments, performance and disclosures continues to increase. We have adopted certain policies and programs, including with respect to responsible production frameworks, climate change, water stewardship, biodiversity, tailings management and stewardship, waste management, safety and health, human capital management, human rights, social performance and community and Indigenous Peoples relations, and supply chain/responsible sourcing. It is possible, however, that our stakeholders might not be satisfied with our ESG practices, commitments, performance and/or disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success. If we do not meet our stakeholders\u2019 evolving expectations, our reputation, access to and cost of capital, and stock price could be negatively impacted.\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, creditors and other influential investors are increasingly focused on our ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the ESG implications of their investments and lending decisions.\nOrganizations that provide information to investors and financial institutions on ESG performance and related matters have developed quantitative and qualitative data collection processes and ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. In addition, many investors have created their own proprietary ratings that inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ratings or assessment of our ESG practices, including our compliance with certain disclosure standards and frameworks, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital.\nSimilarly, some financial institutions have incorporated ESG ratings into their credit risk assessments, and screen companies based on their ESG practices and performance when making lending decisions. If we are unable to meet the ESG lending criteria set by our creditors or are required to take certain remediation steps to satisfy such criteria, our access to capital on terms we find favorable may be limited and our costs may increase.\nAs we continue to focus on our ESG practices, commitments, performance and disclosures, and as ESG-related regulations and disclosure standards and frameworks continue to evolve, we have expanded our public disclosures in these areas. Such disclosures may reflect goals, aspirations, commitments, cost estimates and other expectations and assumptions, including over long timeframes, which are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized.\nFurther, the voluntary disclosure standards or frameworks we choose to align with are evolving and may change over time and our interpretation of such disclosure standards and frameworks may differ from those of others, either of which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period and/or significant revisions to our goals and aspirations or reported progress in achieving such goals and aspirations.\nEnsuring that there are adequate systems and processes in place to comply with the various ESG tracking and disclosure obligations will require management\u2019s time and expense. If we do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations, including with respect to evolving disclosure standards and frameworks, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business, financial condition, cost of capital and/or stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our customers and end users may require that we implement certain additional ESG procedures or standards before they will start or continue to do business with us, which could lead to preferential buying based on our ESG practices compared to our competitors\u2019 ESG practices. Further, being associated with activities by suppliers, contractors or other affiliates that have or are perceived to have individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the environment, climate, biodiversity and land management, water access and management, human rights or cultural heritage could negatively affect our reputation and impose additional costs.\nFailure or the perceived failure to manage our relationships with the communities and/or Indigenous Peoples where we operate or that are near our operations could harm our reputation and social license to operate.\nOur relationships with the communities and/or Indigenous Peoples where we operate or that are adjacent to or near our operations are critical to the long-term success of our existing operations and the development of any future projects. There is ongoing and increasing stakeholder concern relating to a company\u2019s social license to operate and the perceived effects of mining activities on the environment and on communities impacted by such activities. We may engage in activities, such as exploration, production, construction or expansion of our operations that have or are perceived to have adverse impacts on the local communities and their relevant stakeholders, society as a whole, Indigenous Peoples, cultural heritage, human rights and the environment, among other things. For example, our operations may take place on or adjacent to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 ancestral lands, and such Indigenous Peoples may assert rights to the lands where we operate. Further, we may be required or expected by our stakeholders to consult with and/or obtain consent from Indigenous Peoples with respect to these operations.\nIn addition, our assets are generally long-lived and stakeholders\u2019 perceptions and expectations can change over the life of the mine. Changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities and/or Indigenous Peoples where we operate, with respect to our employee health and safety performance and our contributions to infrastructure, community development, environmental management and other factors could affect our social license to operate and reputation, and could lead to delays and/or increased costs if expansions or new projects are blocked either temporarily or for extended periods. Failure to effectively engage with communities on an ongoing basis, including the withdrawal of consent or support of Indigenous Peoples, or other stakeholders, could adversely impact our business, damage our reputation and/or result in loss of rights to explore, operate or develop our projects.\nRisks related to our common stock\nOur holding company structure may impact our ability to service our debt, declare dividends and repurchase shares.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. Cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the U.S.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us or repay loans to us, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements, or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders. Our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including any trade creditors.\nAs more fully described in Note 10, during 2021, our Board of Directors (Board) adopted a performance-based payout framework, which currently includes base and variable dividends and a share repurchase program. Our ability to continue to pay dividends (base or variable) and the timing and amount of any share repurchases is at the discretion of our Board and management, respectively, and is subject to a number of factors, including maintaining our net debt target, capital availability, our financial results, cash requirements, business prospects, global economic conditions, changes in laws, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board or management, as applicable. Our share repurchase program may be modified, increased, suspended or terminated at any time at the Board\u2019s discretion. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board. Refer to Exhibit 4.1 for further discussion of our anti-takeover provisions.\nFurther, our By-Laws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have, or declines to accept, jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim that is based upon a violation of a duty by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders in such capacity, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, (iv) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us or our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our By-Laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in our By-laws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.\nThese provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 81774, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "FCX"}
