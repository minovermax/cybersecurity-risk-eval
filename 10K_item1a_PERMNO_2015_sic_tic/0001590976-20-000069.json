{"cik": "1590976", "company": "MALIBU BOATS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following describes the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, and those of our dealers and suppliers, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted health and economic conditions throughout the United States and the world. Consumer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine have been imposed.\nWe suspended operations at all of our facilities on March 24, 2020. We resumed operations at our Loudon, Tennessee facility (Malibu and Axis boats) on April 20, 2020, our Neodesha, Kansas facility (Cobalt boats) on April 27, 2020 and our Fort Pierce, Florida facility (Pursuit boats) on May 4, 2020. Our temporary closure resulted in a reduction in our production of boats that we were not able to fully recover during fiscal year 2020 and resulted in corresponding delays for delivery of our boats to dealers. As a result, our net sales and unit volume decreased 39.1% and 43.9%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we recognized a decrease in net sales of $30.9 million, or 4.5%, and a decrease of 918 units, or 12.5%, in unit volume compared to fiscal year 2019.\nWhile a number of government measures and recommendations have since been lifted or scaled back since the beginning of the pandemic, intermittent or sustained resurgence of COVID-19 in the United States may result in the reinstatement of certain restrictions or voluntary operational halts in response to efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. It is unclear how long these restrictions or halting of operations may remain in place and they may remain in place in some form for an extended period of time. As a result, our manufacturing facilities, our dealers, or our suppliers may have to suspend operations again, whether voluntarily or as a result of federal, state or local mandates, and such closures could extend for a longer term than the prior shutdown of our facilities. If such shutdowns occur, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our financial results in fiscal year 2021.\nWhile we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 virus on our business at this time, the pandemic and related efforts to mitigate the pandemic have impacted and may continue to impact our business in a number of ways, including but not limited to:\n\u2022decreasing consumer confidence as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic, which could result in a decrease in consumer demand for recreational boats;\n\u2022disrupting our manufacturing processes, as has already occurred with the temporary closures of our facilities and the delay of supplies being received;\n\u2022adversely impacting the financial health of our dealers who typically require financing to purchase our boats;\n\u2022adversely impacting the business of our suppliers, which could result in among other things, delays for delivery of raw materials and components needed for the production of our boats;\n\u2022impacting our ability to maintain our workforce during this uncertain time;\n\u2022increasing employee absenteeism due to fear of infection;\n\u2022increasing possible lawsuits or regulatory actions due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace;\n\u2022suffering from reputational risk if we experience COVID-19 spread in our workplace;\n\u2022increasing the possibility of cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks and other security challenges resulting from a number of our employees and suppliers working remotely; and\n\u2022adversely impacting the productivity of management and our employees that are working remotely, including impacting our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls and our ability to manage complex accounting issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny or all of these items may occur, which individually or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risks could accelerate or intensify depending on the severity and length of the pandemic. In addition, the United States could experience a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus and if the rate of infections continue to rise, these factors likely will be exacerbated.\nIn late March 2020, we elected to draw the then remaining available funds of $98.8 million from our revolving credit facility to ensure we maintained financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We have since repaid $110 million and as of August 27, 2020, we have approximately $110.0 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility, along with $49.9 million of cash on hand. We may need to borrow more under our revolving credit facility depending on the severity and length of the pandemic. Our cash position will depend on multiple factors, including our ability to continue operations and production of boats, the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effects on our dealers and customers, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, and our operating performance. Further, our dealers may seek credit support or other assurances from us that could affect our costs of doing business or liquidity. As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to raise additional capital and such additional debt financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we may be required to record future impairment charges to long-lived assets depending on future events. In addition, depending on the ongoing impact of the pandemic, we may also be required to reserve for credit losses and/or repurchase commitments. Any material increase in our reserves could have a corresponding effect on our results of operations.\nThe ultimate magnitude of COVID-19, including the extent of its impact on our financial condition and results of operations, which could be material, will depend on all of the factors noted above, including other factors that we may not be able to forecast at this time. While we expect the impacts of COVID-19 to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent of these impacts at this time.\nAny potential government crisis relief assistance to help mitigate the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could impose significant limitations on our corporate activities, may dilute our stockholders and may not be on terms favorable to us.\nNumerous government-sponsored crisis relief programs have been implemented in an effort to mitigate the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and others are being considered. If any government agrees to provide crisis relief assistance that we accept, it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid including restrictions on executive officer compensation, share buybacks, dividends, prepayment of debt, limitations on debt, and other similar restrictions that will apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full. We cannot assure you that any such government crisis relief assistance will not significantly limit our corporate activities or be on terms that are favorable to us. Such restrictions and terms could adversely impact our business and operations. In addition, such funding could involve the issuance of warrants, which will be dilutive to our stockholders.\nWeak general economic conditions, particularly in the United States, can negatively impact our industry, demand for our products, and our business and results of operations.\nDemand for new recreational powerboats can be negatively influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence and high unemployment, especially in the United States, and by increased market volatility worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic slowdown and the beginning of a global recession, which could be of an unknown duration. We recognized a decrease in net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of facility closures related to the pandemic, but retail sales of our boats have remained strong during this period as consumers have turned to boating and other outdoor activities for leisure and entertainment alternatives during the pandemic. If, however, the economic slowdown continues for an extended duration or worsens, sales of our boats could be negatively impacted during fiscal year 2021. In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, like we are currently experiencing, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and defer or avoid expenditures for discretionary items, such as boats. Sales of our products are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels, and our success depends on general economic conditions and overall consumer confidence and personal income levels, especially in the United States and in the specific regional markets where we sell our products. Any deterioration in general economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income is likely to reduce our sales and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If general economic conditions deteriorate further, for instance, due to the increased severity or length of the pandemic, it may exacerbate the impact on our business and may delay significantly any potential economic recovery.\nIn addition, consumers often finance purchases of our boats and accordingly, consumer credit market conditions can influence demand for our boats. If credit conditions worsen, which could occur in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products.\nOur annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022seasonal consumer demand for our products;\n\u2022discretionary spending habits;\n\u2022changes in pricing in, or the availability of supply in, the used powerboat market;\n\u2022failure to maintain a premium brand image;\n\u2022disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facilities, such as our temporary shutdown of facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022variations in the timing and volume of our sales;\n\u2022the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales;\n\u2022sales promotions by us and our competitors;\n\u2022changes in competitive and economic conditions generally;\n\u2022changes in trade policy or the imposition of additional tariffs;\n\u2022consumer preferences and competition for consumers\u2019 leisure time; and\n\u2022changes in the cost or availability of our labor.\nAs a result, our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, unfavorable weather conditions, policies impacting access to waterways and shelter-in-place orders may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, especially during the peak boating season.\nAdverse weather conditions in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect sales in that region, especially during the peak boating season. Sales of our products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, which represent the peak boating months in most of our markets, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, reduced rainfall levels, or drought conditions during these periods may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby generally reducing consumer demand for our products. Our annual results would be materially and adversely affected if our net sales were to fall below expected seasonal levels during these periods. We may also experience more pronounced seasonal fluctuation in net sales in the future as we continue to expand our businesses. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our sales may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. There can be no assurance that weather conditions will not have a material effect on the sales of any of our products.\nMany of our customers use our Malibu, Axis and Cobalt boats for recreational water activities and our Pursuit boats for fishing. Regulatory or commercial policies and practices impacting access to water, including availability of slip locations and/or the ability to transfer boats among different waterways, access to fisheries, or the ability to fish in some areas could negatively affect demand for our products. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic shelter-in-place orders were in effect for part of spring 2020 and social distancing policies continue to be in effect during the summer months. These policies and regulations resulted in the closure of our facilities and closure of our dealers and sales of our boats were negatively\nimpacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. Sales of our boats could be impacted during fiscal year 2021 as a result of the continuation and in some cases reinstatement of shelter-in-place orders and social distancing policies.\nWe depend on our network of independent dealers, face increasing competition for dealers and have little control over their activities.\nSubstantially all of our sales are derived from our network of independent dealers. We have agreements with the dealers in our network that typically provide for one-year terms, although some agreements have a term of up to three years. Our top ten dealers represented 38.5%, 39.6% and 37.8%, of our net sales for fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The top ten dealers for each of Malibu, Cobalt and Pursuit represented approximately 45.8%, 45.3% and 82.7%, respectively, of net sales in fiscal year 2020. The top ten dealers for each segment are not the same across all segments. Sales to our dealers under common control of OneWater Marine, Inc. represented approximately 15.2%, 15.1% and 10.7% of consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively including approximately 7.6%, 15.7% and 34.5% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2020 for Malibu, Cobalt and Pursuit, respectively. The loss of a significant number of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales.\nCompetition for dealers among recreational powerboat manufacturers continues to increase based on the quality, price, value and availability of the manufacturers' products, the manufacturers' attention to customer service and the marketing support that the manufacturer provides to the dealers. We face intense competition from other recreational powerboat manufacturers in attracting and retaining dealers, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain relationships with qualified and successful dealers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationship with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the recreational powerboat industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A substantial deterioration in the number of dealers or quality of our network of dealers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the financial health of our dealers and their continued access to financing.\nBecause we sell nearly all of our products through dealers, the financial health of our dealers is critical to our success. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if the financial health of the dealers that sell our products suffers. Their financial health may suffer for a variety of reasons, including a downturn in general economic conditions, rising interest rates, higher rents, increased labor costs and taxes, compliance with regulations and personal financial issues. In addition, our dealers have experienced disruptions to their operations during the pandemic, including temporary closures during which they were either unable or significantly limited in their ability to sell our boats. Our dealers may experience closures again if there are further federal, state or local mandates to suspend operations in light of the increasing rate of infections of COVID-19 in the United States.\nOur dealers also require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our boats. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network. Access to floor plan financing generally facilitates our dealers\u2019 ability to purchase boats from us, and their financed purchases reduce our working capital requirements. If floor plan financing were not available to our dealers, our sales and our working capital levels would be adversely affected. The availability and terms of financing offered by our dealers\u2019 floor plan financing providers may be influenced by:\n\u2022their ability to access certain capital markets and to fund their operations in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022the performance of their overall credit portfolios;\n\u2022their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to dealers; and\n\u2022the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause a strain on some of our dealers\u2019 liquidity and depending on the length and severity of the pandemic, it may result in financing sources becoming less available to our dealers on reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe may be required to repurchase inventory of certain dealers.\nMany of our dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies that enable the dealers to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may have an obligation to repurchase our products from a finance company under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. This obligation is triggered if a dealer defaults on its debt obligations to a finance company, the finance company repossesses the boat and the boat is returned to us. Our obligation to repurchase a repossessed boat for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor plan financing program. If our dealers suffer material economic harm during the COVID-19 pandemic, the dealers may no longer be able to continue in business or, even if they are, they may not be able to maintain their payment obligations under their floor plan financing arrangements and the boats could be repossessed by the floor plan financing provider and returned to us. If boats are returned to us, it would have an adverse impact on our net sales and could result in downward pressure on pricing of our boats. For fiscal year 2020, we repurchased two units from a lender of one of our former dealers and those units were subsequently resold in fiscal year 2020 above their cost and at a minimal margin loss. For fiscal year 2019, we repurchased eight units from a lender of two of our former dealers and those units were subsequently resold in fiscal year 2020 above their cost and at minimal margin loss.\nOne or more dealers may default on the terms of a credit line in the future. In addition, applicable laws regulating dealer relations may also require us to repurchase our products from our dealers under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. If we are required to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement or under applicable dealer laws, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely solely on General Motors for the supply of Malibu and Axis engines, which we integrate for marine use.\nThe availability and cost of engines used in the manufacture of our boats are critical. We purchase engines from General Motors LLC that we then prepare for marine use for our Malibu and Axis boats. Our current agreement with General Motors LLC provides us with engines through model year 2023. If we are required to replace General Motors as our engine supplier for any reason, it could cause a decrease in products available for sale or an increase in our cost of sales, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. During fiscal year 2020 we experienced interruption to our engine supply as a result of the United Auto Workers\u2019 strike against General Motors. During the UAW strike, General Motors suspended delivery of engine blocks to us and we incurred $2.6 million in costs by entering into purchase agreements with two suppliers for additional engines to supplement our inventory of engine blocks for Malibu and Axis boats. General Motors and Unifor, which represents the Canadian autoworkers, have a labor agreement which expires in September 2020 and the parties are currently in negotiations. If the Canadian autoworkers were to strike against General Motors upon expiration of the labor agreement we could experience another interruption to our engine supply which could cause a decrease in products available for sale or an increase in our cost of sales, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have agreed to purchase substantially all of our outboard motors from Yamaha, which makes us reliant on Yamaha for our supply of outboard engines.\nIn August 2018, we entered into a joint marketing agreement with Yamaha Motor Corporation, U.S.A., or Yamaha, that became effective upon completion of our acquisition of Pursuit. Under our agreement with Yamaha, in exchange for certain incentives, we have agreed to purchase Yamaha outboard engines for use in at least 90% of all Pursuit and Cobalt branded boats that are pre-equipped with outboard motors when sold by us. While we believe that this agreement with Yamaha will provide the engines we need for our Cobalt boats and Pursuit boats, Yamaha could potentially exert significant bargaining power over quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to the outboard engines we use. We also must pay penalties to Yamaha if we do not achieve pre-determined purchase volume targets for each year of the agreement and for the entire term of the agreement, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2023, unless extended by both parties. We may not be able to meet the purchase volume targets, which would require us to pay penalties to Yamaha.\nIn addition to General Motors and Yamaha, we rely on other third-party suppliers and may be unable to obtain adequate raw materials and components.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers to provide components and raw materials essential to the construction of our boats. Historically, we have not entered into long-term agreements with our suppliers, but have developed 90-day forecast models with our major suppliers to minimize disruptions in our supply chain. While we believe that our relationships with our current suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet present production demand, we cannot assure you that these\nrelationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of materials available from these suppliers will be sufficient to meet our future needs.\nAny number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a pandemic or contagious disease, contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers\u2019 operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our suppliers experienced temporary closures, with the potential to delay our ability to receive certain components and materials that are essential to the construction of our boats. In addition, the temporary shutdown of our facilities resulted in an inability for us to receive supplies from our vendors. If we do not receive sufficient supplies of materials for production of our boats or if we are required to replace one or more suppliers of any key components or raw materials, it could cause a disruption to our production schedule or cause us to alter productions schedules or suspend production entirely, thereby decreasing products available for sale or causing an increase in the cost of sales, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the above factors, our suppliers could face increased costs or an inability to meet required production levels due to the tariffs the U.S. has imposed on certain foreign goods, including raw materials and components used in our manufacturing process. This could negatively impact our cost of sales, by increasing the price of raw materials and components used in our supply chain.\nTermination or interruption of informal supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe have informal supply arrangements with many of our suppliers. In the event of a termination of the supply arrangement, there can be no assurance that alternate supply arrangements will be made on satisfactory terms. If we need to enter into supply arrangements on unsatisfactory terms, or if there are any delays to our supply arrangements, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs is crucial to our results of operations and future sales and profitability.\nWe rely on the existence of an available hourly workforce to manufacture our boats. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all. For instance, although there are currently high unemployment rates in the regions where we have manufacturing facilities, it is difficult to retain skilled employees. Also, although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, we cannot assure you that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Significant increases in manufacturing workforce costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended operations at all our facilities on March 24, 2020. While we have resumed operations at all our facilities, we have continued to implement safety precautions, including enhanced and more frequent cleaning of our facilities, providing facemasks to each employee, enforcing social distancing guidelines and screening employees for potential symptoms. These additional safety precautions have resulted in increases in manufacturing workforce costs and may also impact the productivity and profitability at our facilities. In addition, we may experience higher levels of absenteeism during the pandemic due to the fear of becoming ill, which may further impact our manufacturing operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to workers' compensation claims and other workplace liabilities.\nCertain materials we use require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel are also at risk for other workplace-related injuries, including slips and falls. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties, and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. While we have implemented safety precautions at our facilities following their reopening after the temporary closures in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also be subject to possible lawsuits or regulatory actions or suffer from reputational risk if we experience COVID-19 spread in our workplace. We may be unable to maintain insurance for these potential liabilities on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nWe have grown our business through acquisitions; however we may not be successful in completing future acquisitions or integrating future acquisitions in a way that fully realizes their expected benefits to our business.\nA key part of our growth strategy, as shown by our acquisition of Pursuit in 2018, of Cobalt in 2017 and of our Australian licensee in 2014, has been to acquire other companies that expand our consumer base, enter new product categories or obtain other competitive advantages. We expect to continue to acquire companies as an element of our growth strategy; however, we may not be able to identify future acquisition candidates or strategic partners as part of our growth strategy that are suitable to our business, or we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms to complete such acquisitions.\nAcquisitions also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated challenges, liabilities and contingencies, and diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations. If we fail to conduct due diligence on our potential targets effectively, we may, for example, not identify problems at target companies, or fail to recognize incompatibilities or other obstacles to successful integration. Our inability to successfully integrate future acquisitions within the intended timeframes or at all could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could severely weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities and competitive responses and may cause our stock price to decline. Even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities that we expect.\nOur growth strategy may require us to secure significant additional capital, the amount of which will depend upon the size, timing, and structure of future acquisitions or vertical integrations and our working capital and general corporate needs.\nOur growth strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses, such as our acquisitions of Cobalt and Pursuit, and the potential integration of new product lines or related products to our boats, such as our initiatives to integrate the production of our own engines and trailers for our Malibu and Axis models. These actions may require us to secure significant additional capital through the borrowing of money or the issuance of equity. Any borrowings made to finance future strategic initiatives could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions, or increases in interest rates on borrowings that are subject to interest rate fluctuations. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements, we could then be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements. Adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects.\nFurther, we could choose to finance acquisitions or other strategic initiatives, in whole or in part through the issuance of our Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our Class A Common Stock. If we do so, existing stockholders will experience dilution in the voting power of their Class A Common Stock and earnings per share could be negatively impacted. The extent to which we will be able and willing to use our Class A Common Stock for acquisitions and other strategic initiatives will depend on the market value of our Class A Common Stock and the willingness of potential third parties to accept our Class A Common Stock as full or partial consideration. Our inability to use our Class A Common Stock as consideration, to generate cash from operations, or to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financings in order to pursue our strategic initiatives could materially limit our growth.\nWe have a large fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease.\nThe fixed cost levels of operating a recreational powerboat manufacturer can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits.\nThe recreational powerboat industry, and in particular the performance sport boat category, is highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for used boats. Competition affects our ability to succeed in the markets we currently serve, including the saltwater outboard fishing boat market in which Pursuit competes, and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily on brand name, price, product selection and product performance. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a variety of small, independent manufacturers. We cannot assure you that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with new competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future competitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales may be adversely impacted by increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand.\nDuring the economic downturn that commenced in 2008, we observed a shift in consumer demand toward purchasing more used boats, primarily because prices for used boats are typically lower than retail prices for new boats. If this were to occur again, especially in light of the current economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it could have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for our new boats. Also, while we have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for our boats with demand, our competitors could choose to reduce the price of their products, which could have the effect of reducing demand for our new boats. Reduced demand for new boats could lead to reduced sales by us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur sales and profitability depend, in part, on the successful introduction of new products.\nMarket acceptance of our products depends on our technological innovation and our ability to implement technology in our boats. Our sales and profitability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable or innovative new products. Our failure to introduce new technologies and product offerings that our markets desire could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we believe we have been able to achieve higher margins in part as a result of the introduction of new features or enhancements to our existing boat models. If we fail to introduce new features or those we introduce fail to gain market acceptance, our margins may suffer.\nIn addition, some of our direct competitors and indirect competitors may have significantly more resources to develop and patent new technologies. It is possible that our competitors will develop and patent equivalent or superior technologies and other products that compete with ours. They may assert these patents against us and we may be required to license these patents on unfavorable terms or cease using the technology covered by these patents, either of which would harm our competitive position and may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe also cannot be certain that our products or technologies have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs and potential damages.\nWe compete with a variety of other activities for consumers\u2019 scarce leisure time.\nOur boats are used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers\u2019 leisure time and by changes in consumer life style, usage pattern or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase and enjoy our products.\nOur success depends upon the continued strength of our brands - Malibu, Axis, Cobalt and Pursuit - and the value of our brands and sales of our products could be diminished if we, the athletes who use our products or the sports and activities in which our products are used, are associated with negative publicity.\nWe believe that our brands - Malibu, Axis, Cobalt and Pursuit - are significant contributors to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands are important to expanding our consumer and dealer base. Failure to continue to protect our brands may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative publicity, including that resulting from recalls or from severe injuries or accidents occurring in the sports and activities in which our products are used, could negatively affect our reputation and result in restrictions or bans on the use of our products. For instance, during fiscal year 2019 we announced a recall with respect to fuel pumps supplied to us by a third-party vendor and used in certain Malibu and Axis models. While the recall also impacted other manufacturers in the recreational powerboat industry, our announcement of the recall could adversely impact the reputation of our brands.\nIn addition, actions taken by athletes associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes could also harm our brand image and adversely affect our financial condition. If the popularity of the sports and activities for which we design, manufacture and sell products were to decrease as a result of these risks or any negative publicity, sales of our products could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our net revenue, profitability and operating results. Further, if we become exposed to additional claims and litigation relating to the use of our products, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including by generating potential negative publicity about our products, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to execute our manufacturing strategy successfully, which could cause the profitability of our products to suffer.\nOur manufacturing strategy is designed to improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. To implement this strategy, we must be successful in our continuous improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production employees and suppliers.\nAs part of our manufacturing strategy, we commenced an initiative in 2016 to produce our own supply of engines for our Malibu and Axis models. Our engines, branded as Malibu Monsoon engines, were in all Malibu and Axis boats for model year 2020. This strategy required significant additional capital, increased the fixed costs of our operations, and may still require further capital investment. Because the integration of engines into our manufacturing process is new to us, we must be successful in continuous improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production employees and suppliers. We are in the early stages of this strategy and if we are not successful in implementing our engine integration strategy, it could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our consumers.\nAny inability to achieve our objectives under our manufacturing strategy could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our consumers.\nProduct liability, warranty, personal injury, property damage and recall claims may materially affect our financial condition and damage our reputation.\nWe are engaged in a business that exposes us to claims for product liability and warranty claims in the event our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, personal injury or death.\nOur Malibu and Axis brand boats have a limited warranty for a period up to five years. Prior to fiscal year 2016, we provided a limited warranty for a period of up to three years for our Malibu brand boats and two years for our Axis boats. We expect the extension of our warranty coverage period to increase our obligations to cover warranty claims over time resulting in an increase in our reserve to cover these warranty claims.\nOur Cobalt brand boats have (1) a structural warranty of up to ten years which covers the hull, deck joints, bulkheads, floor, transom, stringers, and motor mount, and (2) a five year bow-to-stern warranty on all components manufactured or purchased (excluding hull and deck structural components), including canvas and upholstery. Gelcoat is covered up to three years for Cobalt and one year for Malibu and Axis. Pursuit brand boats have (1) a limited warranty for a period of up to five years on structural components such as the hull, deck and defects in the gelcoat surface of the hull bottom, and (2) a bow-to-stern warranty of two year (excluding hull and deck structural components). For each boat brand, there are certain materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our warranty and certain components or parts that are separately warranted by the manufacturer or supplier (such as the engine). Engines that we manufacture for Malibu and Axis models have a limited warranty of up to five years or five-hundred hours.\nOur standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Although we maintain product and general liability insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all such potential claims. We may experience legal claims in excess of our insurance coverage or claims that are not covered by insurance, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse determination of material product liability and warranty claims made against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and harm our reputation. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or alleged defect relates to safety. For example, in fiscal year 2019 we had to announce a recall on fuel pumps supplied to us by a third-party vendor and used in certain Malibu and Axis boats. While this recall has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, future recalls or other claims we face could be costly to us and require substantial management attention.\nWe depend on key personnel and we may not be able to retain them or to attract, assimilate, and retain highly qualified employees in the future.\nOur future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management and our continuing ability to attract, assimilate, and retain highly qualified and skilled managerial, product development, manufacturing, and marketing and other personnel. The loss of services of any members of our senior management or key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur reliance upon patents, trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products and may lead to costly litigation. We are\ncurrently, and may be in the future, party to lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time-consuming.\nWe hold patents and trademarks relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or trademarks or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In the absence of enforceable patent or trademark protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, gain access to our trade secrets and know-how or diminish our brand through unauthorized use of our trademarks, all of which could adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we may need to engage in future litigation to enforce intellectual property rights, to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, others may initiate litigation or other proceedings to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any litigation challenging our patents is unfavorable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies for our business activities and certain events, such as computer hackings, viruses or other destructive or disruptive software or activities may disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies are important to our business activities and operations. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, cyber threats, security breaches, viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns or malicious or other activities could result in a disruption of our services and operations or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which could damage our reputation and require us to expend resources to remedy any such breaches. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring has intensified, in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on cloud servers. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that disruptions and security breaches will not occur in the future. Moreover, we may provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our businesses, and while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. The occurrence of any of such network or information systems-related events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, there is an increased risk that we may experience cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks and other security challenges as a result of most of our employees and our service providers working remotely from non-corporate managed networks during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potentially continuing working remotely even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries concerning the handling of personal information, including laws that require us to notify governmental authorities and/or affected individuals of data breaches involving certain personal information. These laws and regulations include, for example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective May 25, 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective January 1, 2020. Regulatory actions or litigation seeking to impose significant penalties could be brought against us in the event of a data breach or alleged non-compliance with such laws and regulations.\nWe are planning to begin the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and if we are not able to successfully develop and manage that implementation, it could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe are planning to begin the process of designing and implementing a new ERP system. This project will require significant capital and human resources, the re-engineering of many processes of our business, and the attention of our management and other personnel who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. The implementation may be more expensive and take longer to fully implement than we originally plan, resulting in increased capital investment, higher fees and expenses of third parties, delayed deployment scheduling, and more on-going maintenance expense once implemented, and, as such, it will be difficult for us to estimate the ultimate costs and schedules. If for any reason portions of the implementation are not successful, we could be required to expense rather than capitalize related amounts.\nOur international markets require significant management attention, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of sales and profitability.\nWe currently sell our products throughout the world. Our total sales outside North America were less than 10% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. International markets have been, and will continue to be, a focus for sales growth. We believe many opportunities exist in the international markets, and over time we intend for international sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total revenue. Several factors, including weakened international economic conditions and the strength of the U.S. dollar, could adversely affect such growth. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets require significant management attention. Some of the countries in which we market and our distributors sell our products are to some degree subject to political, economic or social instability. Our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the strength of the U.S. dollar could make our products more expensive in international markets and thereby reduce consumer demand;\n\u2022increased costs of customizing products for foreign countries;\n\u2022economic and social instability, and public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease such as COVID-19;\n\u2022unfamiliarity with local demographics, consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns;\n\u2022difficulties in attracting customers due to a reduced level of customer familiarity with our brand;\n\u2022competition with new, unfamiliar competitors;\n\u2022the imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations, including rules relating to environmental, health and safety matters and regulations and other laws applicable to publicly-traded companies, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA;\n\u2022new or enhanced trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors, including the imposition of additional or new tariffs;\n\u2022the imposition of increases in costly and lengthy import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; and\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights.\nOur international operations may not produce desired levels of total sales, or one or more of the foregoing factors may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRising concern regarding international tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe current political landscape has introduced significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations, including the imposition by the U.S. of tariffs and penalties on products manufactured outside the U.S., and existing international trade agreements, as shown by Brexit in Europe. The institution of global trade tariffs (including, but not limited to, the Trump Administration's tariffs on Europe and Canada on certain products from the U.S.), trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls carries the risk of negatively affecting global economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain U.S. goods and may take additional retaliatory trade actions stemming from the tariffs, which could increase the pricing of our products and result in decreased consumer demand for our products outside of the United States, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.\nA portion of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues. We also maintain a portion of our manufacturing operations in Australia which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar in that country. A portion of our selling, general and administrative costs are transacted in Australian dollars as a result. We also sell U.S. manufactured products into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including the sale of products into Canada, Europe and Latin America. Demand for our products in these markets may also be adversely affected by a strengthening U.S. dollar. We do not currently use hedging or other derivative instruments to mitigate our foreign currency risks.\nAn increase in energy and fuel costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facility and in the expense of shipping products to our dealers. In addition, increases in energy costs may adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials, such as resins and foams, that are used in our products. Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for our boats, as they increase the cost of ownership and operation.\nWe are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or the OFAC. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations.\nThe FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions.\nEconomic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons and entities. In addition, because we act through dealers and distributors, we face the risk that our dealers, distributors or consumers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations.\nViolations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We cannot assure you that all of our local, strategic or joint partners will comply with these laws and regulations, in which case we could be held liable for actions taken inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our continued international expansion, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA or OFAC violations in the future.\nIf we are unable to comply with environmental and other regulatory requirements, our business may be exposed to material liability or fines.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, including product safety, environmental and health and safety requirements under various federal, state, local and foreign statutes, ordinances and regulations. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such requirements. Continued compliance with regulatory requirements could increase the cost of our products, which in turn, may reduce consumer demand, or could materially increase the cost of operations. The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could cause us to incur significant fines or penalties, impose obligations to conduct remedial or corrective actions, or, in extreme circumstances, result in revocation of our permits or injunctions preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, the components of our boats must meet certain regulatory standards, including air emission standards for boat engines and fuel systems. Failure to meet these standards could result in an inability to sell our boats in key markets, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, legal requirements are constantly evolving, and changes in laws, regulations or policies, or changes in interpretations of the foregoing, could result in compliance shortfalls, increase our costs or create liabilities where none exists today.\nAs with boat construction in general, our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The failure to manage or dispose of such hazardous substances and wastes properly could expose us to material liability or fines, including liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances, damages to natural resources, or for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions. Under certain environmental laws, we may be liable for remediation of contamination at sites where our hazardous wastes have been disposed or at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned or leased or whether we caused the condition of contamination. We have not been notified of and are otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our current or former facilities, or at any other location, for which we could have any material liability under environmental laws or regulations, and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. Also, the components in our boats may become subject to more stringent environmental regulations. For example, boat engines and other emission producing components may be subject to more stringent emissions standards, which could increase the cost of our engines, components and our products, which, in turn, may reduce consumer demand for our products.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) imposes standards of conduct for and regulates workplace safety, including physical safety and limits on the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations.\nA natural disaster, global pandemic or other disruption at our facilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the continuous operation of our facilities in Tennessee, Kansas, California, Florida and Australia. Any natural disaster, global pandemic or other serious disruption to our facilities due to fire, flood, earthquake or any other unforeseen circumstances could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted health and economic conditions throughout the United States. As a result of the pandemic, we suspended operations at all of our facilities on March 24, 2020. We have since resumed operations at all our facilities. The disruption we experienced during our temporary closure resulted in a reduction in our production of boats that we were not able to fully recover during fiscal year 2020. The temporary shutdown of our facilities also resulted in delays for delivery of our boats to dealers and inability to receive supplies from our vendors. We cannot assure you that we will not have to suspend our operations again, whether voluntarily or as a result of federal, state or local mandates, and such closures could extend for a longer term than the prior shutdown of our facilities.\nChanges in climate could also adversely affect our operations by limiting or increasing the costs associated with equipment or fuel supplies. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as increased frequency and/or severity of storms, or floods could impair our ability to operate by damaging our facilities and equipment or restricting product delivery to customers. The occurrence of any disruption at our facilities, even for a short period of time, may have an adverse effect on our productivity and profitability, during and after the period of the disruption. These disruptions may also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. Although we maintain property, casualty and business interruption insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all potential natural disasters or other disruptions to our facilities.\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nChanges in domestic and international tax legislation could expose us to additional tax liability and could impact the amount of our tax receivable agreement liability. Although we monitor changes in tax laws and work to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any increase in individual income tax\nrates, such as those implemented in the United States at the beginning of 2013, would negatively affect our potential consumers\u2019 discretionary income and could decrease the demand for our products.\nThe credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loan contains restrictive covenants which may limit our operating flexibility and may impair our ability to access sufficient capital to operate our business.\nWe have relied on and continue to rely on our term loan and revolving credit facility to provide us with adequate liquidity to operate our business. Our credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loan contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and additional liens on property and make future payments of dividends or distributions on our capital stock. Further, the credit agreement requires compliance with financial covenants, including a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges and a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDA.\nThese covenants may affect our ability to operate and finance our business as we deem appropriate. Violation of these covenants could constitute an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loan. If there were an event of default under the credit agreement, our lenders could reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities or declare all of the indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan immediately due and payable. We may not have sufficient funds available, or we may not have access to sufficient capital from other sources, to continue funding our operations or to repay any accelerated debt. Even if we could obtain additional financing, the terms of the financing may not be favorable to us. In addition, substantially all of our assets are subject to liens securing our revolving credit facility and term loan. If amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility or term loan were accelerated, our lenders could foreclose on these liens and we could lose substantially all of our assets. Any event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loan could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates are currently at relatively low levels. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We previously managed our exposure to interest rate movements on our term loan through the use of an interest rate swap agreement on a notional amount of $39.3 million, which matured on March 31, 2020. In the future, we may enter into similar interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce future interest rate volatility on our term loan; however, there is no guarantee we may take such action and we may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. A hypothetical 1% increase in the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR could increase our annual interest expense and related cash flows by approximately $0.8 million based on the amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of June 30, 2020.\nThe Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. That announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Moreover, it is possible that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified prior to 2021. All of our $83.8 million of debt outstanding under our credit agreement as of June 30, 2020 bears interest at a floating rate that uses LIBOR as the applicable reference rate to calculate the interest. Our credit agreement provides that, if the administrative agent has determined that adequate means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR or that LIBOR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to lenders for making, funding or maintaining their loans, then all of our outstanding loans under the credit agreement will be converted into loans that accrue interest at the alternative base rate on the last day of such interest period that determination is made. Further, the lenders under our credit agreement will no longer be obligated to make loans using LIBOR as the applicable reference rate. In addition, our tax receivable agreement provides that, if for any reason the LLC is not able to make a tax distribution in an amount that is sufficient to make any required payment under the tax receivable agreement or we otherwise lack sufficient funds, interest would accrue on any unpaid amounts at LIBOR plus 500 basis points until they are paid. Our tax receivable agreement, however, does not provide for an alternative reference rate to LIBOR and, while we do not currently anticipate failing to pay any amounts owed under our tax receivable agreement, it is unclear how we would determine interest on any such amounts should we fail to pay as required under our tax receivable agreement.\nIf the rate used to calculate interest on our outstanding floating rate debt under our credit agreement that currently uses LIBOR were to increase by 1.0% either as a result of an increase in LIBOR or the result of the use of the alternative base rate, we would expect to incur additional interest expense on such indebtedness as of June 30, 2020 of approximately $0.8 million on an annualized basis. While we do not expect the potential impact of any LIBOR transition to have a material effect on our financial results based on our currently outstanding debt, uncertainty as to the nature of potential changes to LIBOR, fallback\nprovisions, alternative reference rates or other reforms could adversely impact our interest expense on our floating rate debt that currently uses LIBOR as the applicable reference rate. In addition, any alternative reference rates to LIBOR may result in interest that does not correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on our indebtedness if LIBOR was available in its current form. Further, the discontinuance or modification of LIBOR and uncertainty of an alternative reference rate may result in the increase in the cost of future indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. We intend to closely monitor the financial markets and the use of fallback provisions and alternative reference rates in 2020 in anticipation of the discontinuance or modification of LIBOR by the end of 2021.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to provide an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management is similarly required to review disclosure controls, which are controls established to ensure that information required to be disclosed in SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. The existence of any material weakness could require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and stock price. In addition, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nOur only material asset is our interest in the LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from the LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreement or pay dividends.\nMalibu Boats, Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Units. Malibu Boats, Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. We intend to cause the LLC to make distributions to its unit holders in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, payments under the tax receivable agreement and dividends, if any, declared by us. To the extent that we need funds, and the LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of its financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. For example, our credit agreement generally prohibits the LLC, Malibu Boats, LLC, Malibu Australian Acquisition Corp., Cobalt Boats, LLC and PB Holdco, LLC from paying dividends or making distributions. Our credit agreement permits, however, (i) distributions based on a member\u2019s allocated taxable income, (ii) distributions to fund payments that are required under the LLC\u2019s tax receivable agreement, (iii) purchase of stock or stock options of the LLC from former officers, directors or employees of loan parties or payments pursuant to stock option and other benefit plans up to $2.0 million in any fiscal year, and (iv) share repurchase payments up to $35.0 million in any fiscal year subject to one-year carry forward and compliance with other financial covenants. In addition, the LLC may make dividends and distributions of up to $10.0 million in any fiscal year, subject to compliance with other financial covenants.\nWe will be required to pay the pre-IPO owners (or any permitted assignee) for certain tax benefits pursuant to our tax receivable agreement with them, and the amounts we may pay could be significant.\nWe entered into a tax receivable agreement with the pre-IPO owners (or their permitted assignees) that provides for the payment by us to the pre-IPO owners (or any permitted assignee) of 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we are deemed to realize as a result of (1) the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of LLC Units and (2) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. These payment obligations are our obligations and not of the LLC. For purposes of the agreement, the benefit deemed realized by us will be computed by comparing our actual income tax liability (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of the LLC as a result of the purchases or exchanges, and had we not entered into the tax receivable agreement. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as\nthe calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the timing of purchases or exchanges - for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair value, which may fluctuate over time, of the depreciable or amortizable assets of the LLC at the time of each purchase or exchange;\n\u2022the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock at the time of the purchase or exchange - the increase in any tax deductions, as well as the tax basis increase in other assets, of the LLC is directly related to the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock at the time of the purchase or exchange;\n\u2022the extent to which such purchases or exchanges are taxable - if an exchange or purchase is not taxable for any reason, increased deductions will not be available; and\n\u2022the amount and timing of our income - the corporate taxpayer will be required to pay 85% of the deemed benefits as and when deemed realized. If we do not have taxable income, we generally will not be required (absent a change of control or other circumstances requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for that taxable year because no benefit will have been realized. However, any tax benefits that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate benefits in previous or future tax years. The utilization of such tax attributes will result in payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nFor more information see Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe expect that the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreement may be substantial. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law, and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the agreement, we expect that future payments under the tax receivable agreement relating to the purchases by Malibu Boats, Inc. of LLC Units will be approximately $49.7 million over the next seventeen (17) years. Future payments to pre-IPO owners (or their permitted assignees) in respect of subsequent exchanges or purchases would be in addition to these amounts and are expected to be substantial. The foregoing numbers are merely estimates and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events, such as changes in tax legislation, could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding tax receivable agreement payments. For example, during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the U.S. Congress enacted tax legislation called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"the Tax Act\") on December 22, 2017, which, among other provisions, lowered our U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act lowered the estimated tax rate used to compute our future tax obligations and, in turn, reduced the future tax benefit expected to be realized by us related to increased tax basis from previous sales and exchanges of LLC Units by pre-IPO owners of the LLC.\nFurther, there may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if distributions to us by the LLC are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after we have paid taxes. For example, we may have an obligation to make tax receivable agreement payments for a certain amount while receiving distributions from the LLC in a lesser amount, which would negatively affect our liquidity. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon the pre-IPO owners\u2019 (or any permitted assignees\u2019) continued ownership of us.\nWe are required to make a good faith effort to ensure that we have sufficient cash available to make any required payments under the tax receivable agreement. The limited liability company agreement of the LLC requires the LLC to make \u201ctax distributions\u201d which, in the ordinary course, will be sufficient to pay our actual tax liability and to fund required payments under the tax receivable agreement. If for any reason the LLC is not able to make a tax distribution in an amount that is sufficient to make any required payment under the tax receivable agreement or we otherwise lack sufficient funds, interest would accrue on any unpaid amounts at LIBOR, plus 500 basis points until they are paid.\nIn certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement to the pre-IPO owners (or any permitted assignees) of LLC Units may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that, in the event that we exercise our right to early termination of the tax receivable agreement, or in the event of a change in control or a material breach by us of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement, the tax receivable agreement will terminate, and we will be required to make a lump-sum payment equal to the\npresent value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the tax receivable agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income. The change in control payment and termination payments to the pre-IPO owners (or any permitted assignees) could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we receive as a result of acquiring the LLC Units because the amounts of such payments would be calculated assuming that we would have been able to use the potential tax benefits each year for the remainder of the amortization periods applicable to the basis increases, and that tax rates applicable to us would be the same as they were in the year of the termination. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine. Although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, to challenge a tax basis increase, Malibu Boats, Inc. will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the benefits that Malibu Boats, Inc. actually realizes in respect of (1) the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of LLC Units and (2) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and stockholders may be unable to sell shares at or above the price at which they purchased them.\nOur stock price ranged from $18.02 per share to $56.93 per share during fiscal year 2020. The market price of our Class A Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, consumer demand and general economic conditions;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022addition or loss of consumers or dealers;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our rate of growth relative to our competitors;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022failure to introduce new products, or for those products to achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022changes in applicable laws or regulations;\n\u2022issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022sales of our Class A Common Stock by us or our stockholders; and\n\u2022share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares.\nFurther, the stock markets may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can affect the market prices of equity securities. These fluctuations can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, could harm the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock may depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish research or reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall; furthermore, you may be diluted by future issuances of Class A Common Stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, in particular sales by our directors, officers or other affiliates, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Furthermore, any Class A Common Stock that we issue in connection with our Long-Term Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, our acquisitions or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur governing documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include, without limitation:\n\u2022a classified board structure;\n\u2022a requirement that stockholders must provide advance notice to propose nominations or have other business considered at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022supermajority stockholder approval to amend our bylaws or certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022authorization of blank check preferred stock.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding Class A Common Stock, from engaging in certain business combinations without the approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our Class A Common Stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock and, consequently, the only opportunity for stockholders to achieve a return on their investment is if the price of our Class A Common Stock appreciates.\nWe currently do not plan to declare or pay dividends on shares of our Class A Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Further, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash distributions from the LLC and the LLC also relies on its subsidiaries for receipt of cash for distributions. This may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the LLC and its subsidiaries, agreements of the LLC or its subsidiaries or covenants under our, the LLC\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 existing or future indebtedness. For example, our credit agreement generally prohibits the LLC, Malibu Boats, LLC, Malibu Australian Acquisition Corp., Cobalt Boats, LLC and PB Holdco, LLC from paying dividends or making distributions. Our credit agreement permits, however, (i) distributions based on a member\u2019s allocated taxable income, (ii) distributions to fund payments that are required under the LLC\u2019s tax receivable agreement, (iii) purchase of stock or stock options of the LLC from former officers, directors or employees of loan parties or payments pursuant to stock option and other benefit plans up to $2.0 million in any fiscal year, and (iv) share repurchase\npayments up to $35.0 million in any fiscal year subject to one-year carry forward and compliance with other financial covenants. In addition, the LLC may make dividends and distributions of up to $10.0 million in any fiscal year, subject to compliance with other financial covenants. Consequently, for stockholders the only opportunity to achieve a return on the shares they purchase will be if the market price of our Class A Common Stock appreciates and they sell their shares at a profit.", "PERMNO": 14434, "SIC": 3730, "TIC": "MBUU"}
