The pace of\nthe government\u2019s\nvaccination rollout\nprogram is seen\nas critical to\nthe re-opening\nof the South\nAfrican economy.\nFailure to achieve\nrollout targets\ncould result\nin further\nCOVID-19 outbreaks,\nwith detrimental\nconsequences for\nthe South\nAfrican economy,\nand our\nbusiness.\nFollowing a\ncomprehensive strategic review,\nwe have\ndecided to\nprioritize Southern\nAfrica as our\ncore\nmarket. Our\nfuture success,\nand our\nability to\nreturn to\nprofitability and\npositive cash\nflow is\nsubstantially\ndependent on our ability to implement this strategy successfully.\nOur board conducted an extensive review\nof our business strategy and operations\nin July 2020, and decided\nto focus on our\nSouth\nAfrican operations\nand other\nbusiness opportunities\nin South\nAfrica and,\nto a\nlesser extent,\nthe rest\nof the\nAfrican continent,\nand to\nexit or\nreduce our\npresence in\nother geographies.\nOur future success\nwill depend\non our\nability to\neffectively and\nefficiently deploy\nthe significant levels of cash\ngenerated from our dispositions. Therefore,\nwe cannot assure you that we will\nbe able to implement our\nnew strategy successfully and return to profitability and positive\ncash flow.\nEven if we do return to profitability, achieving net income does not necessarily\nensure positive cash flows. Future periods of net\nlosses\nfrom\noperations\ncould\nresult\nin\nnegative\ncash\nflow\nand\nmay\nhamper\nongoing\noperations\nor\nprevent\nus\nfrom\nsustaining\nor\nexpanding our business. We cannot assure you that we will achieve, sustain or increase profitability in the future and if we do not, our\nbusiness will be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally,\nour\nreputation\nin South\nAfrica has\nbeen\ntarnished\nas a\nresult\nof public\naccusations,\nwhich\naccusations\nwe have\npublicly denied and believe\nhave no merit,\nagainst us for\nillegally providing our\nservices and defrauding social\nwelfare grant recipients.\nWe have\nattempted to refute these allegations\nand have appointed a\npublic relations firm to\nassist us in communicating\neffectively to\nthe public\nand our\nstakeholders\nthat our\nbusiness practices\ncomply\nwith South\nAfrican law\nand\nare fair\nto the\nsocial welfare\ngrant\nrecipients who\npurchase the financial\nservices products\nthat we offer.\nIf we are\nunable to communicate\nthis persuasively,\nour ability\nto successfully execute our new strategy may be adversely affected.\nWe\nface\nchallenges\nin\ntransforming\nour\nSouth\nAfrican\noperations\nto\na\nbusiness-to-consumer\nmodel\nthrough our various bank account products and ATM infrastructure.\nFollowing the conclusion of our contract with\nSASSA, we refocused our resources and technology\non the provision of financial\ninclusion services\nto our target\nmarket and\ncurrently have an\nestablished base\nof approximately\none million\ncustomers. Our strategy\ninvolves expanding this base to at least three million customers over the next three years. While we believe that our financial services\nofferings are convenient and cost-effective, the success of our strategy will depend on the extent to which we successfully market our\noffering\nto\ngrow\nthe\ncustomer\nbase.\nFactors that\nmay prevent\nus from\nsuccessfully\noperating\nand further\nexpanding\nour South\nAfrican\nfinancial services\nbusiness\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ninsufficient adoption and utilization of our products and\nservices;\n\u2022\ninability to access sufficient funding for our ATM\ninfrastructure;\n\u2022\nincreased competition in the\nmarketplace and restrictions imposed\nby SASSA or\nthe South African\ngovernment on the\nmanner\nin which grant recipients may transact;\n\u2022\npolitical interference and changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nfurther civil unrest similar to that experienced in July 2021;\n\u2022\nloss of key technical and operations staff; and\n\u2022\nlogistical and communications challenges.\nWe may undertake acquisitions\nthat could\nincrease our\ncosts or\nliabilities or\nbe disruptive\nto our\nbusiness.\nAcquisitions are\nan integral part\nof our new\ngrowth strategy\nas we seek\nto expand our\nbusiness and deploy\nour technologies\nin\nnew markets\nin Southern\nAfrica.

In addition, our ability to dispose of our interest in\nMobiKwik on acceptable terms, or at all, may be limited under certain circumstances.\nWe\nhave elected to\naccount for our investment\nin MobiKwik at cost\nminus impairment, if\nany, plus\nor minus changes\nresulting\nfrom observable price\nchanges in orderly\ntransactions for the identical\nor a similar investment\nof the same\nissuer because it does\nnot\nhave a readily determinable fair value. The determination of the fair value of an investment requires us to make significant judgments\nand estimates and we are required to\nbase our estimates on assumptions which we\nbelieve to be reasonable, but these\nassumptions may\nbe unpredictable and inherently\nuncertain. The value of\nour investment in MobiKwik\nas of June 30, 2021\nwas $76.3 million and was\ndetermined based\non a\nshare issuance\nconcluded\nby MobiKwik\nin June\n2021, implying\na fair\nvalue per\nshare of\n$245.50. We\nhave\nrecorded a non-cash fair value adjustment of $49.3 million during\nthe year ended June 30, 2021.\nWe\nmay\nneed to\nrecord a\nwrite-down of\nthe carrying\nvalue of\nour investment\nin MobiKwik\nin the\nfuture (i)\nif it\nis unable\nto\nsuccessfully complete its contemplated initial public offering, (ii) due to fluctuations in its market price upon listing, including during\nthe 12 month\nlock up period\nafter its initial\npublic offering,\nor (iii) if\nit has not\nlisted, there is\nan observable\ntransaction indicating\na\nfair value per\nshare which is\nlower than our\nJune 30, 2021\nprice per share.\nFurthermore, it may\nbe difficult\nto dispose of some\nor all\nof our investment on acceptable terms, if at all, if MobiKwik fails to list.\nOur\nability\nto\nfund\nour\nATM\nnetwork\nrequires\nthat\nwe\ncontinue\nto\nhave\naccess\nto\nsufficient\nlending\nfacilities, which require compliance with restrictive and financial covenants.\nThe expansion\nof our\nATM\nnetwork, along\nwith an\nincrease in\nour consumer\nbanking client\nbase, necessitates\naccess to\nlarge\namounts of\ncash to\nstock the\nATMs\nand maintain\nuninterrupted service\nlevels. We\nhave credit\nfacilities from\nSouth African\nbanks\nwhich includes security arrangements as\nwell as restrictive and\nfinancial covenants. The security arrangements\nand covenants included\nin our lending facilities may reduce our operating flexibility or our ability to engage in other transactions that may be beneficial to us.\nIf we are\nunable to comply\nwith the covenants\nin South Africa,\nwe could be\nin default and\nthe indebtedness\ncould be accelerated.\nIf\nthis were to occur,\nwe might not be\nable to obtain\nwaivers of default\nor to refinance\nthe debt with another\nlender and as a\nresult, our\nbusiness and financial condition would suffer.\nWe may not be able to extend the terms\nof these debt facilities or\nrefinance them, in each case, on\ncommercially reasonable terms\nor at all. Our\nability to continue the\nuninterrupted operation of\nour ATM\nnetwork will be adversely\nimpacted by our failure\nto renew\nour debt facilities, any adverse change to the terms\nof our credit facilities, or a\nsignificant reduction in the amounts available under our\ncredit facilities,\nor our\nfailure to\nincrease our\nfacilities if\nrequired. We\nmay also\nsuffer reputational\ndamage if\nour service\nlevels are\nnegatively impacted due to the unavailability of cash.\nWe may be unable to recover the carrying value of certain\nCell C airtime that we own\nwhich is subject to\nresale restrictions.\nWe\nown a\nsubstantial amount\nof Cell\nC airtime\ninventory ($16.4\nmillion translated\nat exchange\nrates applicable\nas of June\n30,\n2021). In support\nof Cell C\u2019s\nliquidity position,\nwe are limiting\nour resale of\nthis airtime to\nour own distribution\nchannels until such\ntime as Cell C\u2019s recapitalisation\nprocess is concluded, which exposes us to market risk for this inventory.\nDue to wholesale discounts\nin the distribution\nmarket for this\nairtime, it\nis not readily\nsaleable in\nthe current\nmarket without\nrealising a loss.\nIn light\nof this, we\nrecorded a\nloss of\n$1.3 million\nduring fiscal\n2020, related\nto this\nairtime inventory.\nWhilst no\nfurther losses\nwere recorded\nin fiscal\n2021,\nwe may\nbe required\nto record\nfurther\nlosses in\nthe future\nor we\nmay\nbe unable\nto recover\nthe carrying\nvalue\nof this\nairtime\ninventory\nas a\nresult of\nthe business\nfailure\nof Cell\nC. Failure\nto recover\nthe carrying\nvalue of\nthis inventory\nmay\nhave a\nmaterial\nadverse effect on our results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nOur\nmicrolending\nloan\nbook\nexposes\nus\nto\ncredit\nrisk\nand\nour\nallowance\nfor\ndoubtful\nfinance\nloans\nreceivable may not be sufficient to absorb future write-offs.\nAll of\nour microfinance\nloans made\nare for\na period\nof six\nmonths or\nless. We\nhave created\nan allowance\nfor doubtful\nfinance\nloans receivable related to this book. When creating the\nallowance, management considered factors including the period of the\nfinance\nloan\noutstanding,\ncreditworthiness\nof\nthe\ncustomers\nand\nthe\npast\npayment\nhistory\nof\nthe\nborrower.\nWe\nconsider\nthis\npolicy\nto\nbe\nappropriate as it takes into account factors such as historical bad debts, current economic trends and changes in\nour customer payment\npatterns. However, additional allowances may be required should the ability of our customers to make payments when due deteriorate\nin the future.\nIn particular,\nwe cannot predict\nthe impact the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nmay have on\ncollections, though\nto date we\nhave\nnot\nexperienced\nany\nmaterial\ndeterioration\nin collection\nrates.\nA significant\namount\nof\njudgment\nis required\nto\nassess\nthe\nultimate\nrecoverability of these microfinance loan receivables.\nWe may face competition from other\ncompanies that offer innovative\npayment technologies and payment\nprocessing,\nwhich\ncould\nresult\nin\nthe\nloss\nof\nour\nexisting\nbusiness\nand\nadversely\nimpact\nour\nability\nto\nsuccessfully market additional products and services.\nOur primary competitors in\nthe payment processing market\ninclude other independent processors,\nas well as\nfinancial institutions,\nindependent\nsales\norganizations,\nnew\ndigital\nand\nfintech\nentrants\nand,\npotentially\ncard\nnetworks.\nMany\nof\nour\ncompetitors\nare\ncompanies who\nare larger\nthan we\nare and\nhave greater\nfinancial and\noperational resources\nthan we\nhave. These\nfactors may\nallow\nthem to offer better pricing\nterms or incentives to customers, which\ncould result in a loss of our potential\nor current customers and/or\nforce us to lower our prices. Either of these actions could have a significant\neffect on our revenues and earnings.\nOur\nfuture\nsuccess\nwill\ndepend\nin\npart\non\nour\nability\nto\nattract,\nintegrate,\nretain\nand\nincentivize\nkey\npersonnel\nand\na\nsufficient\nnumber\nof\nskilled\nemployees,\nparticularly\nin\nthe\ntechnical,\nsales\nand\nsenior\nmanagement areas.\nOur group has undergone a significant change in management over the last twelve months, with various long-serving executives\nhaving resigned from the organization. Therefore, we are in the process of building a new\nmanagement team with the right experience\nand skills to execute on our new strategic direction. Further, in order to succeed in\nour product development and marketing efforts, we\nneed to identify, attract, motivate and retain sufficient numbers of qualified technical and sales personnel. As a result, we must attract,\nretain and motivate a number of highly-qualified and experienced employees and an inability\nto hire and retain such employees would\nadversely\naffect\nour\nability\nto\nenhance\nour\nexisting\nintellectual\nproperty,\nto\nintroduce\nnew\ngenerations\nof\ntechnology\nand\nto\nkeep\nabreast of\ncurrent developments\nin technology.\nWe\nmay face\ndifficulty\nin managing\nthe transition\nto a\nnew management\nteam and\nassimilating\nour\nnewly-hired\npersonnel,\nwhich\nmay\nadversely\naffect\nour\nbusiness.\nCompetitors\nmay\nattempt\nto\nrecruit\nour\ntop\nmanagement and employees.\nIn order to attract\nand retain personnel\nin a competitive\nmarketplace, we must\nprovide competitive pay\npackages, including cash\nand equity-based compensation\nand the volatility in\nour stock price may\nfrom time to time\nadversely affect\nour ability to recruit or\nretain employees. We\ndo not maintain any\n\u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies.\nIf we fail to attract, integrate,\nretain and\nincentivize key\npersonnel and\nskilled employees,\nour ability\nto manage\nand grow\nour business\ncould be\nharmed and\nour\nproduct development and marketing activities could be negatively affected.\nSystem failures, including breaches in the security of our system, could harm our business.\nWe\nmay experience\nsystem failures\nfrom time\nto time,\nand any\nlengthy interruption\nin the availability\nof our\nback-end system\ncomputers could\nharm our business and\ncould subject us\nto the scrutiny\nof our customers.\nFrequent or persistent\ninterruptions in our\nservices could\ncause current\nor potential\ncustomers and\nusers to\nbelieve that\nour systems\nare unreliable,\nleading them\nto avoid\nour\ntechnology altogether,\nand could permanently harm\nour reputation and brands.\nThese interruptions would increase\nthe burden on our\nstaff,\nwhich,\nin\nturn,\ncould\ndelay\nour\nintroduction\nof\nnew\napplications\nand\nservices.\nFinally,\nbecause\nour\ncustomers\nmay\nuse\nour\nproducts for critical transactions, any system\nfailures could result in damage\nto our customers\u2019 businesses. These\ncustomers could seek\nsignificant compensation from us\nfor their losses. Even if\nunsuccessful, this type of claim could\nbe time-consuming and costly for\nus\nto address.\nAlthough our systems\nhave been designed\nto reduce downtime in\nthe event of outages\nor catastrophic occurrences,\nthey remain\nvulnerable\nto\ndamage\nor\ninterruption\nfrom\nearthquakes,\nfloods,\nfires,\npower\nloss,\ntelecommunication\nfailures,\nterrorist\nattacks,\ncomputer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Some\nof our systems are not\nfully redundant, and our disaster\nrecovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.\nProtection against fraud is of key\nimportance to the purchasers and end\nusers of our solutions. We\nincorporate security features,\nincluding encryption\nsoftware, biometric\nidentification and\nsecure hardware,\ninto our solutions\nto protect\nagainst fraud in\nelectronic\ntransactions and\nto provide for\nthe privacy\nand integrity of\ncardholder data.\nOur solutions may\nbe vulnerable to\nbreaches in security\ndue to\ndefects in\nthe security\nmechanisms, the\noperating system\nand applications\nor the\nhardware platform.\nSecurity vulnerabilities\ncould\njeopardize\nthe\nsecurity\nof\ninformation\ntransmitted\nusing\nour\nsolutions.\nIf\nthe\nsecurity\nof\nour\nsolutions\nis\ncompromised,\nour\nreputation and marketplace acceptance\nof our solutions may be adversely\naffected, which would cause our\nbusiness to suffer,\nand we\nmay become subject to damage claims. We\nhave not yet experienced any significant security breaches\naffecting our business.\nDespite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our system\ncould\nresult in lengthy interruptions\nin our services. Our current\nbusiness interruption insurance may\nnot be sufficient to\ncompensate us for\nlosses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nCash\nPaymaster\nServices,\nor\nCPS,\nhas\nbeen\nplaced\ninto\nliquidation.\nWhile\nno\nclaim\nhas\nbeen\nmade\nagainst Net1 for CPS\u2019 obligations, we cannot provide assurance that no such claim will be made.\nCPS has significant obligations and ongoing litigation related to its SASSA contract and has been placed into liquidation. While\nno claim\nhas been made\nagainst Net1 to\nbe held liable\nfor CPS\u2019\ncurrent obligations\nor any future\nobligations under\nany future\ncourt\njudgments, and while we do not believe that there would be a legitimate legal basis for any such claims, we cannot assure you that no\nsuch claim\nwill be\nmade against\nus. If\nSASSA or\nanother\nthird party\nwere to\nseek and\nultimately succeed\nin obtaining\na judgment\nagainst us in respect of CPS\u2019 liabilities, any such judgment would have\na material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nDefending\nour\nintellectual\nproperty\nrights\nor\ndefending\nourselves\nin\ninfringement\nsuits\nthat\nmay\nbe\nbrought against us is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful.\nLitigation to\nenforce our\npatents, trademarks\nor other\nintellectual property\nrights or\nto protect\nour trade\nsecrets could\nresult in\nsubstantial costs and may not be successful. Any loss of, or inability to protect, intellectual property in our technology could diminish\nour competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our\nintellectual property\nrights to\nthe same\nextent as\ndo the\nlaws in\ncountries where\nwe currently\nhave patent\nprotection. Our\nmeans of\nprotecting our intellectual property rights in countries where we currently have patent or trademark protection, or any other country in\nwhich we operate, may not be\nadequate to fully protect our intellectual property rights.\nSimilarly, if third parties claim that we infringe\ntheir intellectual property rights, we may be required to incur significant\ncosts and devote substantial resources to the defense of such\nclaims,\nto\ndiscontinue\nusing\nand\nselling\nany\ninfringing\ntechnology\nand\nservices,\nto\nexpend\nresources\nto\ndevelop\nnon-infringing\ntechnology or\nto purchase\nlicenses or\npay royalties\nfor other\ntechnology.\nIn addition,\nif we\nare unsuccessful\nin defending\nany such\nthird-party\nclaims, we\ncould\nsuffer\ncostly judgments\nand\ninjunctions\nthat could\nmaterially\nadversely\naffect\nour business,\nresults of\noperations or financial condition.\nWe\nmay\nincur\nmaterial\nlosses\nin\nconnection\nwith\nour\ndistribution\nof\ncash\nthrough\nour\npayment\ninfrastructure in South Africa.\nMany\ncardholders\nuse our\nservices to\naccess cash\nusing\ntheir debit\ncards.\nWe\nuse armored\nvehicles\nand\nour own\nfixed ATM\ninfrastructure to\ndeliver large\namounts of\ncash to rural\nareas across\nSouth Africa\nto enable these\ncardholders to\nreceive this cash.\nIn\nsome cases, we also store the cash that will be delivered by the armored vehicles in depots overnight or over the weekend to facilitate\ndelivery to these rural areas. We cannot insure against certain risks of loss or theft of cash\nfrom our delivery vehicles, ATMs or depots\nand we\nwill therefore\nbear the\nfull cost\nof certain\nuninsured losses\nor theft\nin connection\nwith the\ncash handling\nprocess, and\nsuch\nlosses could\nmaterially and\nadversely affect\nour financial\ncondition, cash\nflows and results\nof operations.\nWe\nhave not\nincurred any\nmaterial losses resulting from cash distribution in recent\nyears, but there is no assurance\nthat we will not incur\nany such material losses\nin the future.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations,\nwhich could harm our business.\nWe obtain our smart\ncards, ATMs, POS devices and\nthe other\nhardware we use\nin our\nbusiness from a\nlimited number of\nsuppliers,\nand\ndo\nnot\nmanufacture\nthis\nequipment\nourselves.\nWe\ngenerally\ndo\nnot\nhave\nlong-term\nagreements\nwith\nour\nmanufacturers\nor\ncomponent suppliers. If our\nsuppliers become unwilling or unable\nto provide us with adequate supplies\nof parts or products when we\nneed them, or if they increase\ntheir prices, we may not\nbe able to find alternative\nsources in a timely manner\nand could be faced with\na critical shortage.\nThis could harm\nour ability to\nimplement new systems\nand cause\nour revenues\nto decline.\nEven if we\nare able to\nsecure alternative\nsources in a\ntimely manner,\nour costs could\nincrease. A supply\ninterruption, such\nas the current\nglobal shortage of\nsemiconductors, or\nan increase\nin demand\nbeyond current\nsuppliers\u2019 capabilities\ncould harm\nour ability\nto distribute\nour equipment\nand thus to\nacquire a new\nsource of customers\nwho use our\ntechnology.\nAny interruption in\nthe supply of\nthe hardware necessary\nto\noperate our technology, or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at\nacceptable prices in a timely\nmanner, could impair our ability\nto meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect\non our business.\nOur Smart Life business exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies.\nSmart Life is a life insurance company and exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance\ncompanies. Some of these\nrisks\ninclude\nthe\nextent\nto\nwhich\nwe\nare\nable\nto\ncontinue\nto\nreinsure\nour\nrisks\nat\nacceptable\ncosts,\nreinsurer\ncounterparty\nrisk,\nmaintaining regulatory capital adequacy, solvency and\nliquidity requirements, our ability\nto price our\ninsurance products appropriately,\nthe risk\nthat actual\nclaims experience\nmay exceed\nour estimates, the\nability to\nrecover policy\npremiums from\nour customers\nand the\ncompetitiveness of the South African insurance market. If we are unable to maintain our desired level of reinsurance\nat prices that we\nconsider acceptable, we would have to either\naccept an increase in our exposure risk\nor reduce our insurance writings.\nIf our reinsurers\nare unable\nto meet\ntheir commitments\nto us\nin a\ntimely manner,\nor at\nall, we may\nbe unable\nto discharge\nour obligations\nunder our\ninsurance contracts.

However, institutions in these countries\nand regions may not yet\nbe as firmly established as\nthey\nare in\ndemocracies in\nthe developed\nworld. Many\nof these\ncountries and\nregions are\nalso in the\nprocess of\ntransitioning to\na market\neconomy and, as\na result, are experiencing\nchanges in their\neconomies and their\ngovernment policies that\ncan affect our\ninvestments\nin these countries and regions.\nMoreover,\nthe\nprocedural\nsafeguards\nof\nthe\nnew\nlegal\nand\nregulatory\nregimes\nin\nthese\ncountries\nand\nregions\nare\nstill\nbeing\ndeveloped and, therefore, existing\nlaws and regulations may be\napplied inconsistently.\nIn some circumstances, it may\nnot be possible\nto obtain\nthe legal\nremedies\nprovided under\nthose laws\nand regulations\nin a\ntimely manner.\nAs these\npolitical,\neconomic and\nlegal\nenvironments remain subject to continuous development, investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the\nsecurity of\ntheir investments.\nIf\nwe\ndo\nnot\nachieve\napplicable\nBroad-Based\nBlack\nEconomic\nEmpowerment\nobjectives in\nour\nSouth\nAfrican businesses, we\nmay be subject\nto fines and\nwe risk losing\nour government and/or\nprivate contracts.\nIn addition,\nit is\npossible that\nwe may\nbe required\nto increase\nthe Black\nshareholding of\nour company\nin a\nmanner that\ncould dilute\nyour ownership\nand/or change\nthe companies\nfrom which\nwe purchase\ngoods or\nprocure services (to companies with a better BEE Contributor Status Level).\nThe legislative framework for the promotion of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment, or BEE, in South Africa has been\nestablished through\nthe Broad-Based\nBlack Economic\nEmpowerment\nAct, No.\n53 of\n2003, as\namended from\ntime to\ntime, and\nthe\nAmended\nBEE\nCodes\nof\nGood\nPractice,\n2013,\nor\nBEE\nCodes,\nand\nany\nsector-specific\ncodes\nof\ngood\npractice,\nor\nSector\nCodes,\npublished pursuant\nthereto.

Annexure EEA9 to the Employment Equity Regulations sets out the various occupational levels\nwhich are determined in\naccordance with the relevant\ngrading systems applied by\nthe measured entity and\nreferred to in said\nAnnexure.\nEmployment equity legislation seeks\nto drive the\nalignment of the\nworkforce with the\nracial composition of\nSouth Africa and\naccelerate\nthe achievement\nof employment\nequity targets,\nintroducing monetary\nfines for\nnon-achievement.\nFailing to\nmeet these\ntargets\nmay\nexpose us to fines.\nWe\nhave taken a\nnumber of actions\nas a company\nto increase empowerment\nof Black (as\ndefined under applicable\nregulations)\nSouth Africans. However,\nit is possible that these actions\nmay not be sufficient\nto enable us to achieve applicable\nBEE objectives. In\nthat event,\nin order to\navoid risking the\nloss of our\ngovernment and private\ncontracts, we\nmay have\nto seek to\ncomply through\nother\nmeans, including by\nselling or placing additional\nshares of Net1 or of\nour South African subsidiaries\nto Black South Africans\n(either\ndirectly or indirectly). Such sales or placements of shares could have a dilutive impact on\nyour ownership interest, which could cause\nthe market price of our stock to decline.\nWe\nexpect that\nour BEE Contributor\nStatus Level will\nbe important\nin order for\nus to remain\ncompetitive in\nthe South African\nmarketplace and we continually seek ways to improve our BEE Contributor Status Level, especially the ownership element (so-called\n\u201cequity\nelement\u201d)\nthereof.\nWe\nhave\nentered\ninto various\nBEE\ntransactions\nin the\npast\nin an\neffort\nto improve\nour\nscore,\nincluding\ntransactions in which we\nissued equity to\nBEE partners.

Therefore, any depreciation in\nthe ZAR against the U.S. dollar, would negatively impact\nour reported revenue\nand net\nincome. The\nU.S. dollar/ZAR\nexchange rate\nhas historically\nbeen volatile\nand we\nexpect this\nvolatility to\ncontinue (refer\nto\nItem\n7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion\nand\nAnalysis\nof\nFinancial\nCondition\nand\nResults\nof\nOperations-Currency\nExchange\nRate\nInformation.\u201d).\nDue\nto\nthe\nsignificant\nfluctuation\nin\nthe\nvalue\nof\nthe\nZAR\nand\nits\nimpact\non\nour\nreported\nresults,\nyou\nmay\nfind\nit\ndifficult to\ncompare our results\nof operations between\nfinancial reporting periods\neven though we\nprovide supplemental information\nabout our\nresults of\noperations determined\non a\nZAR basis.\nSimilarly,\ndepreciation in\nthe ZAR\nmay negatively\nimpact the\nprices at\nwhich our stock trades.\nWe generally do not engage in any currency hedging\ntransactions intended to reduce the\neffect of fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates on our results of\noperations, other than economic hedging\nusing forward contracts relating\nto our inventory purchases\nwhich are settled in U.S.\ndollars or euros.

In addition, South Africa has\na high prevalence\nof HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Government policies aimed at alleviating and redressing the disadvantages suffered by the majority of\ncitizens\nunder\nprevious\ngovernments\nmay\nincrease\nour\ncosts and\nreduce\nour\nprofitability,\nall of\nwhich\ncould\nnegatively\naffect\nour\nbusiness.\nThese\nproblems\nmay\nprompt\nemigration\nof\nskilled\nworkers,\nhinder\ninvestment\ninto\nSouth\nAfrica\nand\nimpede\neconomic\ngrowth. As a result, we may have difficulties attracting\nand retaining qualified employees.\nWe\nmay\nnot\nbe\nable\nto\neffectively\nand\nefficiently\nmanage\nthe\nelectricity\nsupply\ndisruptions\nin\nSouth\nAfrica,\nwhich\ncould\nadversely\naffect\nour\nresults\nof\noperations,\nfinancial\nposition,\ncash\nflows\nand\nfuture\ngrowth.\nOur businesses in\nSouth Africa are\ndependent on electricity\ngenerated and supplied\nby the state-owned\nutility,\nEskom, in order\nto operate, and Eskom has been unable to generate and supply the amount of electricity required which has resulted in significant and\noften unpredictable electricity\nsupply disruptions. Eskom\nhas implemented a\nnumber of short-\nand long-term mitigation\nplans to correct\nthese issues but supply disruptions continue to occur regularly and with\nno predictability. Eskom requires significant funding from the\nSouth African\ngovernment in\norder to\ncontinue to\noperate. As\npart of\nour business\ncontinuity programs,\nwe have\ninstalled back\n-up\ndiesel generators in order for us to continue to operate our core data processing facilities in the event of intermittent disruptions to our\nelectricity supply. We have to perform regular monitoring and maintenance of these generators and\nalso source and manage diesel\nfuel\nlevels. We may\nalso be required to replace these generators on a more frequent basis due to the additional\nburden placed on them.\nOur results of\noperations, financial position,\ncash flows and\nfuture growth could\nbe adversely affected\nif Eskom is unable\nraise\nsufficient funding to operate\nand/or commission new electricity-generating\npower stations in accordance with its\nplans, or at all, or if\nwe are unable to effectively and efficien\ntly test, maintain, source fuel for, and replace, our generators\n.\nThe\neconomy\nof\nSouth\nAfrica\nis\nexposed\nto\nhigh\nrates\nof\ninflation,\ninterest\nand\ncorporate\ntax,\nwhich\ncould\nincrease\nour\noperating\ncosts\nand\nthereby\nreduce\nour\nprofitability.\nFurthermore,\nthe\nSouth\nAfrican\ngovernment requires additional\nincome to fund\nfuture government\nexpenditures and may\nbe required,\namong\nother things, to increase\nexisting income taxes rates,\nincluding the corporate\nincome tax rate,\namend existing\ntax legislation or introduce additional taxes.\nThe economy of\nSouth Africa in the\npast has been, and\nin the future may\ncontinue to be, characterized\nby rates of inflation\nand\ninterest that\nare substantially\nhigher than\nthose prevailing\nin the United\nStates and\nother highly-developed\neconomies. High\nrates of\ninflation could increase our South African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. High interest rates increase the cost of our\ndebt financing, though conversely they\nalso increase the amount of\nincome we earn on\nany cash balances. The\nSouth African corporate\nincome tax\nrate, of\n28%, is\nhigher than\nthe U.S.\nfederal income\ntax rate,\nof 21%.\nThe South\nAfrican government\nhas announced\na\nnumber of programs and initiatives\nthat may require funding from a\nvariety of sources, including from\nan increase in existing tax\nrates,\nincluding the corporate income\ntax rate; amendments\nto existing South\nAfrican tax legislation;\nor through the\nintroduction of additional\ntaxes.\nAn\nincrease\nin\nthe\neffective\nSouth\nAfrican\ncorporate\nincome\ntax\nrate\nwill\nadversely\nimpact\nour\nprofitability\nand\ncash\nflow\ngeneration.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation\nThe\nSouth\nAfrican\nNational\nCredit\nRegulator,\nor\nNCR,\nhas\napplied\nto\ncancel\nthe\nregistration\nof\nour\nsubsidiary, Moneyline\nFinancial Services (Pty) Ltd, or\nMoneyline, as a credit\nprovider.

Furthermore,\nwe expect that\nit will take\nus, and other\nfinancial services providers,\nsome time to\nfully understand,\ninterpret and\nimplement this new\nlegislation in\nour\nlending\nprocesses\nand\npractices.\nNon-compliance\nwith\nthe\nprovisions\nof\nthis\nnew\nlegislation\nmay\nresult\nin\nfinancial\nloss\nand\npenalties, reputational loss or other administrative punishment.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe\nmay\nbe\ndeemed\nto\nbe\nan\ninvestment\ncompany\nunder\nthe\nInvestment\nCompany\nAct\nof\n1940,\nor\nInvestment Company Act.\nWe\nare an operating\ncompany whose business\nis focused on developing\nand offering payment\nsolutions, transaction processing\nservices and financial technologies across\nmultiple industries directly and through\nour wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our conduct,\npublic\nfilings and\nannouncements\nhold us\nout\nas such\nan operating\ncompany\nand\ndo not\nhold\nus out\nas being\nengaged\nin the\nbusiness of\ninvesting, reinvesting or trading in\nsecurities. However, we own certain assets\nthat may be deemed\nto be \u201cinvestment securities\u201d\nwithin\nthe meaning\nof Section\n3(a)(2) of\nthe Investment\nCompany Act.\nWe\nacquired these\nassets pursuant\nto our\nformer business\nstrategy,\nwhich\ninvolved\nentering\ninto\nstrategic\npartnership\narrangements\nwith\nother\ncompanies\nin\na\nnumber\nof\nemerging\nand\ndeveloping\neconomies.\nWhen we\nacquired\nminority\ninterests in\nthese companies,\nwe would\ntypically have\nboard\nrepresentation\nor rights\nwith\nregard to significant decisions.\nDuring fiscal\n2021, after\na comprehensive\nstrategic review,\nwe shifted our\nstrategy to focus\nprimarily on\nour Southern African\noperations and other business opportunities in Southern Africa and determined\nto exit or reduce our presence in other geographies. In\nfurtherance\nof\nthis\nstrategy\nand\nalso\ndue\nto\nthe\nenormous\nuncertainties\nand\ndisruptions\ncaused\nby\nthe\nCOVID-19\npandemic,\nwe\ncancelled our option\nto acquire an\nadditional 35% interest\nin Bank Frick\n(which would have\nincreased our interest\nto 70%) and\ndisposed\nof the 35% that we\nowned. Further,\nduring fiscal 2020, we sold\nKSNET,\nour wholly-owned Korean\nsubsidiary,\nas well as other non-\ncore\nbusinesses,\nwhich\nresulted\nin\na\nlarge\ninfusion\nof\ncash\nwhich\nwe\nhave\nnot\nyet\ndeployed\ninto\nour\noperating\nbusinesses.\nThese\ndispositions and the Bank\nFrick transactions, when combined with\nthe fluctuating value of those\nof our assets that may\nbe deemed to\nbe investment securities,\ncould cause us\nto be deemed\nto be an investment\ncompany within the\nmeaning of Section\n3(a)(1)(C) of the\nInvestment Company Act. Regardless of the value of these assets at any particular time, we believe we should be viewed as primarily\nengaged\nin\na\nbusiness\nother\nthan\ni\nnvesting,\nreinvesting,\nowning,\nholding,\nor\ntrading\nin\nsecurities.\nIf we are deemed\nan investment company\nand not entitled to\nan exception or\nexemption from registration\nunder the Investment\nCompany Act, we would have to register as\nan investment company, modify our asset profile or otherwise change our business so that\nit falls outside\nthe definition\nof an investment\ncompany under the\nInvestment Company\nAct. Registering\nas an investment\ncompany\npursuant to\nthe Investment\nCompany Act\ncould, among\nother things,\nmaterially limit\nour ability\nto borrow\nfunds or\nengage in\nother\ntransactions and\notherwise would\nsubject us\nto substantial\nand costly\nregulation. Failure\nto register,\nif required,\nwould significantly\nimpair our ability to continue to engage in our business and would have a material\nadverse impact on our business and operations.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has periodically experienced significant volatility. During the 2021 fiscal year, our stock\nprice ranged from a low\nof $2.87 to a high of $6.62. We\nexpect that the trading price of our common stock may\ncontinue to be volatile as a result of a number\nof factors, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nany adverse developments in litigation or regulatory actions in which\nwe are involved;\n\u2022\nfluctuations\nin currency exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar/ZAR exchange rate;\n\u2022\nannouncement of additional BEE transactions, especially one involving the issuance or\npotential issuance of equity securities\nor dilution or sale of our existing business in South Africa;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nsignificant fair value adjustments or impairment in respect of investments\nor intangible assets;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions or disposals;\n\u2022\nthe timing of, or delays in the commencement, implementation\nor completion of major projects;\n\u2022\nlarge purchases or sales of our common stock; and\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the markets in which we operate.\nAdditionally,\nshares of\nour common\nstock can\nbe expected\nto be\nsubject to\nvolatility resulting\nfrom purely\nmarket forces\nover\nwhich\nwe\nhave\nno\ncontrol.\nIf\nour\nbusiness\ndevelopment\nplans\nare\nsuccessful,\nwe\nmay\nrequire\nadditional\nfinancing\nto\ncontinue\nto\ndevelop\nand\nexploit\nexisting\nand\nnew\ntechnologies,\nto\nexpand\ninto\nnew\nmarkets\nand\nto\nmake\nacquisitions,\nall\nof\nwhich\nmay\nbe\ndependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity\nor other means.\nThe put\nright we granted\nto the IFC\nInvestors on the\noccurrence of certain\ntriggering events may\nhave\nadverse impacts on us.\nIn May\n2016, we\nissued an\naggregate of\n9,984,311\nshares of\nour common\nstock to\nthe IFC Investors,\nof which,\nas of\nJune 30,\n2021,\nthe\nIFC\nInvestors\nheld\n7,881,142\nshares.\nWe\ngranted\nthe\nIFC\nInvestors\ncertain\nrights,\nincluding\nthe\nright\nto\nrequire\nus\nto\nrepurchase\nany\nshare held\nby the\nIFC\nInvestors\npursuant\nto\nthe\nMay\n2016 transaction\nupon\nthe occurrence\nof specified\ntriggering\nevents,\nwhich\nwe refer\nto as\na\n\u201cput\nright.\u201d\nThe put\nprice\nper share\nwill be\nthe higher\nof the\nprice\nper\nshare paid\nto us\nby\nthe IFC\nInvestors and\nthe volume-weighted\naverage price\nper share prevailing\nfor the 60\ntrading days preceding\nthe triggering\nevent, except\nthat with respect\nto a put right\ntriggered by rejection\nof a bona\nfide offer,\nthe put price\nper share will\nbe the highest\nprice offered\nby\nthe offeror.\nIf a put triggering event occurs, it could adversely\nimpact our liquidity and capital resources. In addition,\nthe existence of\nthe put right could also affect whether or on what terms a third party might in the future offer to purchase our company.\nOur response\nto any such offer could also be complicated, delayed or\notherwise influenced by the existence of the put right.\nApproximately\n36%\nof\nour\noutstanding\ncommon\nstock\nis\nowned by\ntwo shareholders.\nThe\ninterests of\nthese shareholders may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nThere is a concentration of ownership\nof our outstanding common stock because\napproximately 36% of our outstanding common\nstock is owned by two\nshareholders. Based on their most\nrecent SEC filings disclosing\nownership of our shares, Value Capital Partners\n(Pty) Ltd, or VCP,\nand IFC Investors, beneficially own approximately 22% and 14% of our outstanding\ncommon stock, respectively.\nVCP has agreed, pursuant to an Amended Cooperation Agreement dated December 9, 2020, to refrain from acquiring more than\n24.9% of our outstanding common stock or taking certain\nactions, including acting in concert with others, that\ncould result in a change\nof control\nof the\nCompany.\nThese restrictions\nremain in\neffect through\nto the\nbusiness day\nimmediately following\nour 2022\nannual\nmeeting of shareholders.\nThe interests of\nVCP and the\nIFC Investors may\nbe different\nfrom or conflict\nwith the interests\nof our other\nshareholders. As a\nresult of the significant combined ownership by VCP and the IFC Investors, subject\nto the limitations applicable to VCP contained in\nthe\nAmended\nCooperation\nAgreement,\nthey\nmay\nbe\nable, if\nthey\nact\ntogether,\nto\nsignificantly\ninfluence\nthe\nvoting\noutcome\nof\nall\nmatters requiring\nshareholder approval.\nThis concentration\nof ownership\nmay have\nthe effect\nof delaying\nor preventing\na change\nof\ncontrol\nof\nour\ncompany,\nthus\ndepriving\nshareholders\nof\na\npremium\nfor\ntheir\nshares,\nor\nfacilitating\na\nchange\nof\ncontrol\nthat\nother\nshareholders\nmay\noppose.\nWe may seek to raise\nadditional financing by\nissuing new securities\nwith terms or\nrights superior to\nthose\nof shares of our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of such shares.\nWe\nmay require\nadditional financing\nto fund future\noperations, including\nexpansion in\ncurrent and new\nmarkets, programming\ndevelopment and acquisition,\ncapital costs and\nthe costs of any\nnecessary implementation of\ntechnological innovations or\nalternative\ntechnologies, or\nto fund\nacquisitions. Because\nof the\nexposure to\nmarket risks\nassociated with\neconomies in\nemerging markets,\nwe\nmay not be able\nto obtain financing on favorable\nterms or at all.\nIf we raise additional funds\nby issuing equity securities, the\npercentage\nownership of our current\nshareholders will be reduced,\nand the holders of the new\nequity securities may have\nrights superior to those\nof the holders of shares of common stock,\nwhich could adversely affect the market price and\nvoting power of shares of common stock.\nIf we raise additional\nfunds by issuing debt\nsecurities, the holders of\nthese debt securities would\nsimilarly have some rights\nsenior to\nthose of\nthe holders\nof shares\nof common\nstock, and\nthe terms\nof these\ndebt securities\ncould impose\nrestrictions on\noperations and\ncreate a significant interest expense for us.\nIssuances\nof significant\namounts\nof stock\nin the\nfuture\ncould potentially\ndilute\nyour equity\nownership\nand adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe\nbelieve that\nit is necessary\nto maintain\na sufficient\nnumber of\navailable authorized\nshares of our\ncommon stock\nin order\nto\nprovide\nus\nwith\nthe flexibility\nto\nissue\nshares\nfor\nbusiness\npurposes\nthat\nmay\narise\nfrom time\nto\ntime.\nFor example,\nwe\ncould\nsell\nadditional shares to\nraise capital\nto fund our\noperations or to\nacquire other businesses,\nissue shares in\na BEE\ntransaction, issue additional\nshares under our\nstock incentive plan\nor declare a\nstock dividend. Our\nboard may authorize\nthe issuance of\nadditional shares of\ncommon\nstock\nwithout\nnotice\nto,\nor\nfurther\naction\nby,\nour\nshareholders,\nunless\nshareholder\napproval\nis\nrequired\nby\nlaw\nor\nthe\nrules\nof\nthe\nNASDAQ Stock Market. The issuance of additional shares could\ndilute the equity ownership of our current\nshareholders and any such\nadditional shares would likely be freely tradable, which could adversely\naffect the trading price of our common stock.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial\nreporting in accordance with Section 404\nof\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act, especially\nover companies that we may\nacquire, could have a material\nadverse effect\non our business and stock price.\nUnder Section 404\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002,\nor Sarbanes, we\nare required to\nfurnish a management\ncertification and\nauditor attestation regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nWe are\nrequired to report, among other\nthings, control deficiencies that constitute a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d\nor changes in internal control that\nmaterially affect, or are reasonably\nlikely\nto\nmaterially\naffect,\ninternal\ncontrol\nover\nfinancial\nreporting.\nA\n\u201cmaterial\nweakness\u201d\nis\na\ndeficiency,\nor\na\ncombination\nof\ndeficiencies, in internal control\nover financial reporting such\nthat there is\na reasonable possibility\nthat a material\nmisstatement of annual\nor interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on\na timely basis.\nThe\nrequirement\nto\nevaluate\nand\nreport\non\nour\ninternal\ncontrols\nalso\napplies\nto\ncompanies\nthat\nwe\nacquire.\nSome\nof\nthese\ncompanies may not\nbe required\nto comply with\nSarbanes prior\nto the\ntime we\nacquire them.\nThe integration of\nthese acquired\ncompanies\ninto our internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting could require significant\ntime and resources\nfrom our management\nand other\npersonnel\nand may increase our compliance costs.\nIf we fail to successfully\nintegrate the operations of these\nacquired companies into our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, our internal control over financial reporting\nmay not be effective.\nWhile\nwe\ncontinue\nto\ndedicate\nresources\nand\nmanagement\ntime\nto\nensuring\nthat\nwe\nhave\neffective\ncontrols\nover\nfinancial\nreporting, failure to\nachieve and maintain\nan effective internal\ncontrol environment could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on\nthe market\u2019s\nperception of our business and our stock price.\nYou\nmay\nexperience\ndifficulties\nin\neffecting\nservice\nof\nlegal\nprocess,\nenforcing\nforeign\njudgments\nor\nbringing\noriginal\nactions\nbased\nupon\nU.S.\nlaws,\nincluding\nfederal\nsecurities\nlaws\nor\nother\nforeign\nlaws,\nagainst us or certain of our directors and officers and experts.\nWhile Net1\nis incorporated\nin the state\nof Florida,\nUnited States,\nthe company\nis headquartered\nin Johannesburg,\nSouth Africa\nand substantially all of the company\u2019s assets are located outside the United States. In addition, the majority of Net1\u2019s\ndirectors and all\nits officers reside outside of the\nUnited States and the majority\nof our experts, including our\nindependent registered public accountants,\nare based in South Africa.\nAs a result, even though\nyou could effect service\nof legal process upon Net1,\nas a Florida corporation, in\nthe United States, you\nmay not be able to collect any judgment obtained against Net1\nin the United States, including any judgment based on the\ncivil liability\nprovisions of\nU.S. federal\nsecurities laws,\nbecause substantially\nall of\nour assets\nare located\noutside the\nUnited States.\nMoreover,\nit\nmay not be possible for you to\neffect service of legal process upon the majority\nof our directors and officers or upon our\nexperts within\nthe\nUnited\nStates or\nelsewhere\noutside\nSouth\nAfrica\nand\nany\njudgment\nobtained\nagainst any\nof\nour\nforeign\ndirectors,\nofficers\nand\nexperts\nin\nthe\nUnited\nStates,\nincluding\none\nbased\non\nthe\ncivil\nliability\nprovisions\nof\nthe\nU.S.\nfederal\nsecurities\nlaws,\nmay\nnot\nbe\ncollectible\nin\nth\ne\nUnited\nStates\nand\nmay\nnot\nbe\nenforced\nby\na\nSouth\nAfrican\ncourt.\nSouth Africa\nis not\na party\nto any\ntreaties regarding\nthe enforcement\nof foreign\ncommercial judgments,\nas opposed\nto foreign\narbitral awards.\nAccordingly,\na foreign judgment\nis not directly\nenforceable in\nSouth Africa, but\nconstitutes a cause\nof action\nwhich\nmay be enforced by South African courts provided that:\n\u2022\nthe court which pronounced the judgment had international jurisdiction and\ncompetence to entertain the case according to\nthe\nprinciples recognized by South African law with reference to the jurisdiction\nof foreign courts;\n\u2022\nthe judgment is final and conclusive (that is, it cannot be altered by the court\nwhich pronounced it);\n\u2022\nthe judgment\nhas not lapsed;\n\u2022\nthe recognition\nand enforcement\nof the\njudgment by\nSouth African\ncourts would\nnot be\ncontrary to\npublic policy\nin South\nAfrica, including\nobservance of the\nrules of natural\njustice which require\nthat no award\nis enforceable\nunless the defendant\nwas duly served with documents initiating proceedings, that he or she was given a fair opportunity to be heard and that he or\nshe enjoyed the right to be legally represented in a free and fair trial before an impartial tribunal;\n\u2022\nthe judgment was not obtained by improper or fraudulent means;\n\u2022\nthe\njudgment\ndoes\nnot\ninvolve\nthe\nenforcement\nof\na\npenal\nor\nforeign\nrevenue\nlaw\nor\nany\naward\nof\nmultiple\nor\npunitive\ndamages; and\n\u2022\nthe enforcement of\nthe judgment is\nnot otherwise precluded\nby the provisions\nof the Protection\nof Business Act\n99 of 1978\n(as amended), of the Republic of South Africa.\nIt has been the policy\nof South African courts to award\ncompensation for the loss or damage\nactually sustained by the person\nto\nwhom the compensation is awarded. South African courts have awarded compensation to shareholders who have suffered damages as\na result\nof a\ndiminution in\nthe value\nof their\nshares based\non various\nactions by\nthe corporation\nand its\nmanagement. Although\nthe\naward of punitive\ndamages is generally\nunknown to the\nSouth African legal\nsystem, that does\nnot mean that\nsuch awards are\nnecessarily\ncontrary to public policy.\nWhether a judgment\nwas contrary to\npublic policy\ndepends on the\nfacts of each\ncase. Exorbitant,\nunconscionable, or\nexcessive\nawards will generally be contrary to public policy. South African courts cannot\nenter into the merits of a foreign judgment and cannot\nact as a court of appeal or review over the foreign court. Further, if a foreign judgment is enforced by a South African\ncourt, it will be\npayable\nin South\nAfrican currency.\nAlso, under\nSouth\nAfrica\u2019s\nexchange\ncontrol laws,\nthe approval\nof SARB\nis required\nbefore a\ndefendant resident in South Africa may pay money to a non-resident plaintiff in satisfaction of a foreign judgment enforced by a court\nin South Africa.\nIt is\ndoubtful\nwhether an\noriginal\naction based\non United\nStates federal\nsecurities laws\nmay\nbe brought\nbefore South\nAfrican\ncourts. A plaintiff who\nis not resident in South Africa\nmay be required to provide security\nfor costs in the event of proceedings\nbeing\ninitiated in\nSouth Africa.\nFurthermore, the\nRules of\nthe High\nCourt of\nSouth Africa\nrequire that\ndocuments executed\noutside South\nAfrica must be authenticated for the purpose of use in South African courts. In reaching the foregoing conclusions in respect of South\nAfrica, we consulted with our South African legal counsel, Cliffe\nDekker Hofmeyr Inc.", "PERMNO": 90875, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "UEPS"}
