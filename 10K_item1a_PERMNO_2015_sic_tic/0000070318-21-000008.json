RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that may cause our actual operating results or financial performance to be materially different from our expectations and make an investment in our securities risky. If one or more of the events discussed in this report were to occur, actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements we make in this report or our other filings with the SEC, and our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected; furthermore, the trading price of our common stock could decline and our shareholders could lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Overall Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected our operations and financial condition, and it continues to do so; moreover, our liquidity could be negatively impacted, particularly if the U.S. economy remains unstable for a significant period of time.\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted all three segments of our business, as well as our patients, communities and employees. The spread of COVID-19 and the ensuing response of federal, state and local authorities beginning in March 2020 resulted in a material reduction in our patient volumes and also adversely affected our net operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020. Known and unknown risks and uncertainties caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including those described below, have had, and are continuing to have, a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; such risks and uncertainties may heighten other risks to our business as described herein.\nIn accordance with governmental mandates, from mid-March through early May 2020, we suspended elective procedures at many of our hospitals and ASCs; we also voluntarily reduced operating hours or temporarily closed some of our outpatient centers during this time. Restrictive measures, including travel bans, social distancing, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, also reduced the number of procedures performed at our facilities more generally, as well as the volume of emergency room and physician office visits. Collectively, these measures had an adverse impact on our business and financial results in the year ended December 31, 2020, as further described in MD&A. Given the geographic diversity of our operations and the impact of COVID-19 surges, we have been and may in the future be forced to reduce services at individual locations again. In general, federal, state or local laws, regulations, orders or other actions imposing direct or indirect restrictions on our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are treating patients with COVID-19 in our hospitals and, in some areas, the increased demand for care is putting a strain on our resources and staff, which has required us to utilize higher-cost temporary labor and pay premiums above standard compensation for essential workers. Increased demand could also cause some of our hospitals to reduce their operating capacity. In addition, even with appropriate protective measures, exposure to COVID-19 increases the risk that physicians, nurses and others in our hospitals may contract the virus, which could further limit our ability to treat all patients who seek care. If conditions worsen, some of our hospitals may experience workforce disruptions. Furthermore, we may be subject to lawsuits from patients, employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at our facilities. Such actions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs. Our professional and general liability insurance may not cover all claims against us.\nWe have experienced supply chain disruptions, including shortages and delays, as well as significant price increases in medical supplies, particularly for personal protective equipment. COVID-19 surges in our markets and elsewhere could further impact the cost of medical supplies, and supply shortages and delays may impact our ability to see, admit and treat patients.\nBroad economic factors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased unemployment rates and reduced consumer spending have impacted, and are continuing to impact, our service mix, revenue mix and patient volumes. Business\nclosings and layoffs in the areas we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients to pay for services as rendered. Any increase in the amount of or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. If general economic conditions continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be impacted. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nChanges to COVID-19-related relief measures may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and we cannot predict whether we will qualify, apply for, receive or benefit from additional financial assistance in the future or whether any future laws and regulations related to or in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations.\nAs described in detail in MD&A, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and other legislative and regulatory actions have provided relief measures intended to mitigate some of the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business; however, interpretations of and regulations relating to these laws are subject to change in ways that may adversely affect our funding or eligibility to participate. For example, if we are unable to attest to or comply with the terms and conditions associated with the grants we have received from COVID-19-related stimulus legislation, our ability to retain some or all of the distributions received may be impacted. In general, we are unable to predict whether changes, if any, to existing or future COVID-19 relief measures will have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Moreover, some of the measures allowing for flexibility in delivery of care and financial support for healthcare providers are available only for the duration of the public health emergency as declared by the Secretary of HHS, and it is unclear whether or for how long the HHS declaration will be extended past its current expiration date.\nThe federal government and state and local governments may consider additional stimulus and relief efforts, but we are unable to predict whether any such measures will be enacted or their impact on our operations. There can also be no assurance that we will be eligible or apply for, or receive or benefit from, additional COVID-19-related stimulus assistance in the future, nor can there be any assurance as to the amount and type of assistance we may receive or seek or whether we will be able to comply with the applicable terms and conditions to retain such assistance.\nAt this time, we remain unable to fully assess the extent to which the amounts or benefits received under current or future relief measures related to or in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will offset the negative impacts on our operations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe cannot predict the impact that modifications of the Affordable Care Act may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe initial expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act resulted in an increase in the number of patients using our facilities with either private or public program coverage and a decrease in uninsured and charity care admissions. Although a substantial portion of both our patient volumes and, as a result, our revenues has historically been derived from government healthcare programs, reductions to our reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs as a result of the ACA have been partially offset by increased revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals.\nIn recent years, the healthcare industry, in general, and the acute care hospital business, in particular, have been experiencing significant regulatory uncertainty based, in large part, on administrative, legislative and judicial efforts to significantly modify or repeal and potentially replace the ACA. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the matter of California v. Texas addressing whether the ACA\u2019s individual mandate provision is unconstitutional given that Congress eliminated the tax penalty that was intended to enforce it in January 2019. Conversely, members of Congress and other politicians have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payer plans, such as Medicare for All. We cannot predict whether the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision will invalidate the Affordable Care Act, nor can we predict if or when further modification of the ACA will occur or what action, if any, Congress might take with respect to eventually repealing and possibly replacing the law.\nWe are also unable to predict the impact on our future revenues and operations of (1) the final decision in California v. Texas and other court challenges, (2) administrative, regulatory and legislative changes, including expansion of government-sponsored coverage, or (3) market reactions to those changes. However, if the ultimate impact is that significantly fewer individuals have private or public health coverage, we likely will experience decreased patient volumes, reduced revenues and an increase in uncompensated care, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or other government healthcare programs, including reductions in scale and scope, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 20% and 8% of our net patient service revenues less implicit price concessions for the hospitals and related outpatient facilities in our Hospital Operations segment were from the Medicare program and various state Medicaid programs, respectively, in each case excluding Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to: statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements, funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements, among other things; requirements for utilization review; and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future, as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities, which could in turn adversely affect our overall business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nEven prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, several states in which we operate faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Because most states must operate with balanced budgets, and the Medicaid program is generally a significant portion of a state\u2019s budget, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting future legislation designed to reduce or not increase their Medicaid expenditures. In addition, some states delay issuing Medicaid payments to providers to manage state expenditures. As an alternative means of funding provider payments, many of the states in which we operate have adopted supplemental payment programs or have received federal government waivers allowing them to test new approaches and demonstration projects to improve care. Continuing pressure on state budgets and other factors, including legislative and regulatory changes, could result in future reductions to Medicaid payments, payment delays, changes to Medicaid supplemental payment programs or additional taxes on hospitals.\nIn general, we are unable to predict the effect of future government healthcare funding policy changes on our operations. If the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced, if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited, or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries\u2019 hospitals are excluded from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any other government healthcare program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nViolations of existing regulations or failure to comply with new or changed regulations could harm our business and financial results.\nOur hospitals, outpatient centers and related healthcare businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, licensure, contractual arrangements, conduct of operations, privacy of patient information, ownership of facilities, physician relationships, addition of facilities and services, and reimbursement rates for services. The laws, rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in certain areas, the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance. Moreover, under the ACA, the government and its contractors may suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to providers of services \u201cpending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.\u201d The potential consequences for violating such laws, rules or regulations include reimbursement of government program payments, the assessment of civil monetary penalties, including treble damages, fines, which could be significant, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, or criminal sanctions against current or former employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or cash flows. Even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of law could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock and our business reputation could suffer.\nFurthermore, healthcare, as one of the largest industries in the United States, continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local healthcare legislation, regulation or enforcement efforts, particularly in light of the recent changes in Presidential and Congressional leadership. Further changes in the regulatory framework negatively affecting healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, our operations at our Global Business Center in the Philippines are subject to certain U.S. healthcare industry-specific requirements, as well as U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. One such law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. FCPA enforcement actions continue to be a high priority for the SEC and the DOJ. Our failure to comply with the FCPA could result in the imposition of fines and other civil and criminal penalties, which could be significant.\nWe could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs as a result of significant legal actions.\nWe are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, antitrust claims and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. In addition, from time to time, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation (including employee class action lawsuits) concerning our application of various federal and state labor laws, rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues. Some of these actions involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to such caps. Our professional and general liability insurance does not cover all claims against us, and it may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain at adequate levels, as the healthcare industry has seen a significant rise in the cost of such insurance due to increased litigation. We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal actions against us or the effect that judgments or settlements in such matters may have on us or on our insurance costs. Additionally, all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations. If the aggregate limit of any of our professional and general liability policies is exhausted, in whole or in part, it could deplete or reduce the limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period. Any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working capital. Furthermore, one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill its or their obligations to defend, pay or reimburse us when those obligations become due. In that case or if payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to enter into, maintain and renew managed care contractual arrangements on acceptable terms, if we experience material reductions in the contracted rates we receive from managed care payers or if we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 66%, or $9.0 billion, of our net patient service revenues for the hospitals and related outpatient facilities in our Hospital Operations segment was attributable to managed care payers, including Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs. In 2020, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from the hospitals in our Hospital Operations segment was approximately 95% higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers, including managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans. Our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with HMOs, insurers offering preferred provider arrangements and other managed care plans, as well as add new facilities to our existing agreements at contracted rates, significantly affects our revenues and operating results. We currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various HMOs and PPOs; however, our top 10 managed care payers generated 62% of our managed care net patient service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Because of this concentration, we may experience a short or long-term adverse effect on our net operating revenues if we cannot renew, replace or otherwise mitigate the impact of expired contracts with significant payers. Furthermore, any disputes between us and significant managed care payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. At December 31, 2020, 66% of our net accounts receivable for our Hospital Operations segment was due from managed care payers.\nPrivate payers are increasingly attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis, increased utilization reviews and greater enrollment in managed care programs, such as HMOs and PPOs. Price transparency initiatives and increasing vertical integration efforts involving third-party payers and healthcare providers, among other factors, may increase these challenges. Any negotiated discount programs we agree to generally limit our ability to increase reimbursement rates to offset increasing costs. Furthermore, the ongoing trend toward consolidation among non-government payers tends to increase their bargaining power over contract terms. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our existing managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on competitive terms. Generally, we compete for these contracts on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, caliber of the medical staff and convenience. Other healthcare providers, including some with greater financial resources, greater geographic coverage or a wider range of services, may affect our ability to enter into acceptable managed care contractual arrangements or negotiate increases in our reimbursement. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Any material reductions in the contracted rates we receive for our services or any significant difficulties in collecting receivables from managed care payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing and alternative payment models may negatively impact our revenues.\nValue-based purchasing and alternative payment model initiatives of both governmental and private payers tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet expected quality standards. Medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically. In addition, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments, and hospitals that have \u201cexcess readmissions\u201d for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement. Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions (\u201cHACs\u201d), unless the conditions were present at admission. Hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for HACs in the previous year receive reduced Medicare reimbursements. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions.\nThe ACA also created the CMS Innovation Center to develop and test innovative payment and service delivery models that have the potential to reduce Medicare, Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care for beneficiaries. Congress has defined - both through the ACA and previous legislation - a number of specific demonstrations for CMS to conduct, including bundled payment models. Generally, the bundled payment models hold hospitals financially accountable for the quality and costs for an entire episode of care for a specific diagnosis or procedure from the date of the hospital admission or inpatient procedure through 90 days post-discharge, including services not provided by the hospital, such as physician, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing and home health care. Provider participation in some of these models is voluntary; however, participation in certain other bundled payment arrangements is mandatory for providers located in randomly selected geographic locations. Under the mandatory models, hospitals are eligible to receive incentive payments or will be subject to payment reductions within certain corridors based on their performance against quality and spending criteria. We cannot predict what impact, if any, these demonstration programs will have on our inpatient volumes, net revenues or cash flows.\nThere is also a trend among private payers toward value-based purchasing and alternative payment models for healthcare services. Many large commercial payers expect hospitals to report quality data, and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts.\nWe are unable at this time to predict how the industry trend toward value-based purchasing and alternative payment models will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues, particularly if we are unable to meet the quality and cost standards established by both governmental and private payers.\nOur hospitals, outpatient centers and other healthcare businesses operate in competitive environments, and competition in our markets can adversely affect patient volumes and other aspects of our operations.\nWe believe our hospitals and outpatient facilities compete for patients within local communities on the basis of many factors, including: quality of care; location and ease of access; the scope and breadth of services offered; reputation; and the caliber of the facilities, equipment and employees. In addition, the competitive positions of hospitals and outpatient facilities depend in significant part on the number, quality, specialties, and admitting and scheduling practices of the licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of those facilities, as well as physicians who affiliate with and use outpatient centers as an extension of their practices. Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital or outpatient facility is the ability to negotiate contracts with managed care plans. HMOs, PPOs, third-party administrators and other third-party payers use managed care contracts to encourage patients to use certain hospitals in exchange for discounts from the hospitals\u2019 established charges. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than we are, we may experience an overall decline in patient volumes. Furthermore, healthcare consumers are now able to access hospital performance data on quality measures and patient satisfaction, as well as standard charges for services, to compare competing providers; if any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys, or if our standard charges are or are perceived to be higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients. Additional quality measures and trends toward clinical or billing transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes.\nSome of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by tax-supported government agencies, and many others are owned by not-for-profit organizations that may have financial advantages not available to our facilities, including (i) support through endowments, charitable contributions and tax revenues, (ii) access to tax-exempt financing, and (iii) exemptions from sales, property and income taxes. In addition, in certain markets in which we operate, large teaching hospitals provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. State laws that require findings of need for construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services (as described in \u201cHealthcare Regulation and Licensing - Certificate of Need Requirements\u201d above) may also impact competition. In recent years, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments and diagnostic imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. Some of these facilities are physician-owned. Moreover, we expect to encounter additional competition from system-affiliated hospitals and healthcare companies, as well as health insurers and private equity companies seeking to acquire providers, in specific geographic markets in the future.\nIt is essential to our ongoing business that we attract an appropriate number of quality physicians in the specialties required to support our services and that we maintain good relations with those physicians.\nThe success of our business and clinical program development depends in significant part on the number, quality, specialties, and admitting and scheduling practices of the licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of our hospitals and other facilities, as well as physicians who affiliate with us and use our facilities as an extension of their practices. Physicians are often not employees of the hospitals or surgery centers at which they practice. Members of the medical staffs of our facilities also often serve on the medical staffs of facilities we do not operate, and they are free to terminate their association with our facilities or admit their patients to competing facilities at any time. In addition, although physicians who own interests in our facilities are generally subject to agreements restricting them from owning an interest in competitive facilities, we may not learn of, or be unsuccessful in preventing, our physician partners from acquiring interests in competitive facilities.\nWe expect to encounter increased competition from health insurers and private equity companies seeking to acquire providers in the markets where we operate physician practices and, where permitted by law, employ physicians. In some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain specialties and the difficulties that physicians can experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance. Furthermore, our ability to recruit and employ physicians is closely regulated. For example, the types, amount and duration of compensation and assistance we can provide to recruited physicians are limited by the Stark law, the Anti-kickback Statute, state anti-kickback statutes and related regulations. All arrangements with physicians must also be fair market value and commercially reasonable. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of quality physicians by providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment, and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, physicians may choose not to refer patients to our facilities, admissions and outpatient visits may decrease and our operating performance may decline.\nOur labor costs can be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity.\nThe operations of our facilities depend on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, including nurses, therapists, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our employed physicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining employees, and, like others in the healthcare industry, we continue to experience a shortage of critical-care nurses in certain disciplines and geographic areas, which shortage has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, from time to time, we have been and we may continue to be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain experienced employees, make greater investments in education and training for newly licensed medical support personnel, or hire more expensive temporary or contract employees. Furthermore, state-mandated nurse-staffing ratios in California affect not only our labor costs, but, if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios, they may also cause us to limit volumes, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues. In general, our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, experienced nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased labor union activity is another factor that can adversely affect our labor costs. At December 31, 2020, approximately 28% of the employees in our Hospital Operations segment were represented by labor unions. Less than 1% of the total employees in both our Ambulatory Care and Conifer segments belong to a union. Unionized employees - primarily registered nurses and service, technical and maintenance workers - are located at 35 of our hospitals, the majority of which are in California, Florida and Michigan. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is a possibility that strikes could occur, and our continued operation during any strikes\ncould increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient volumes and net operating revenues. Organizing activities by labor unions could increase our level of union representation in future periods, which could result in increases in salaries, wages and benefits expense.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, catastrophic events and other disruptions affecting our information technology and related systems.\nInformation technology is a critical component of the day-to-day operation of our business. We rely on our information technology to process, transmit and store sensitive and confidential data, including protected health information, personally identifiable information, and our proprietary and confidential business performance data. We utilize electronic health records and other information technology in connection with all of our operations, including our billing, supply chain and labor management functions. Our systems, in turn, interface with and rely on third-party systems. Although we monitor and routinely test our security systems and processes and have a diversified data network that provides redundancies as well as other measures designed to protect the integrity, security and availability of the data we process, transmit and store, the information technology and infrastructure we use have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses, attacks by hackers, or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional stress on our information technology systems, and the risk of disruption to these systems is elevated in the current environment. In particular, we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity threats, including ransomware attacks targeting healthcare providers.\nIn general, attacks or breaches could impact the integrity, security or availability of data we process, transmit or store, or they could disrupt our information technology systems, devices or businesses. While we are not aware of having experienced a material breach of our systems, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of such incidents and protect our information technology may not be sufficient in the future. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may not be able to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective protective measures, and we will be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen our security measures, investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities in our information systems and infrastructure, and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks. Furthermore, we have an increased risk of security breaches or compromised intellectual property rights as a result of outsourcing certain functions unrelated to direct patient care. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not offset the financial impact of a material loss event.\nThird parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions, or with whom our systems interface and who may, in some instances, store our sensitive and confidential data, are also subject to the risks outlined above and may not have or use controls effective to protect such information. A breach or attack affecting any of these third parties could similarly harm our business. Further, successful cyber-attacks at other healthcare services companies, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of consumer confidence in our industry that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or of the healthcare industry in general, which could result in reduced use of our services.\nOur networks and technology systems have experienced disruption due to events such as system implementations, upgrades, and other maintenance and improvements, and they are subject to disruption in the future for similar events, as well as catastrophic events, including a major earthquake, fire, hurricane, telecommunications failure, ransomware attack, terrorist attack or the like. Any breach or system interruption of our information systems or of third parties with access to our sensitive and confidential data could result in: the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, loss or alteration of such data; interruptions and delays in our normal business operations (including the collection of revenues); patient harm; potential liability under privacy, security, consumer protection or other applicable laws; regulatory penalties; and negative publicity and damage to our reputation. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur cost-reduction initiatives do not always deliver the benefits we expect, and actions taken may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future financial performance and level of profitability is dependent, in part, on various cost-reduction initiatives, including our efforts to outsource certain functions unrelated to direct patient care. We may encounter challenges in executing our cost-reduction initiatives and not achieve the intended cost savings. In addition, we may face wrongful termination, discrimination or other legal claims from employees affected by any workforce reductions, and we may incur substantial costs defending against such claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims may also significantly increase our severance costs. Workforce reductions, whether as a result of internal restructuring or in connection with outsourcing efforts, may result in the loss of numerous long-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, the reallocation of certain job responsibilities and the disruption of business continuity, all of which could negatively affect operational efficiencies and\nincrease our operating expenses in the short term. Moreover, outsourcing and offshoring expose us to additional risks, such as reduced control over operational quality and timing, foreign political and economic instability, compliance and regulatory challenges, and natural disasters not typically experienced in the United States, such as volcanic activity and tsunamis. Our failure to effectively execute our cost-reduction initiatives may lead to significant volatility, and a decline, in the price of our common stock. We cannot guarantee that our cost-reduction initiatives will be successful, and we may need to take additional steps in the future to achieve our profitability goals.\nTrends affecting our actual or anticipated results may require us to record charges that may negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a result of factors that have negatively affected our industry generally and our business specifically, we have been required to record various charges in our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $92 million. Our impairment tests presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining operating results in our hospitals, which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospitals\u2019 most recent projections. If these projections are not met, or negative trends occur that impact our future outlook, future impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill may occur, and we may incur additional restructuring charges, which could be material. Future restructuring of our operating structure that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in future impairments of our goodwill. Any such charges could negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $2.4 billion pre-tax available to offset future taxable income. Of these NOL carryforwards, $1.13 billion will expire in the years 2021 to 2034, and $1.24 billion has no expiration date. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a company\u2019s taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company\u2019s \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. (This is different from a change in beneficial ownership under applicable securities laws.) These ownership changes include purchases of common stock under share repurchase programs, a company\u2019s offering of its stock, the purchase or sale of company stock by five-percent shareholders, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire company stock. While we expect to be able to realize our total NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, if an ownership change occurs, our ability to use the NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards. Furthermore, we could be required to record a valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL carryforwards that may not be realized, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures\nWhen we acquire new assets or businesses, we become subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, and we expect to pursue similar transactions in the future. A key business strategy for USPI, in particular, is the acquisition and development of facilities, primarily through the formation of joint ventures with physicians and health system partners. With respect to planned or future transactions, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate transactions on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve synergies or other benefits in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, companies or operations we acquire may not be profitable or may not achieve the profitability that justifies the investments made. Businesses we acquire may also have pre-existing unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with applicable healthcare regulations. These liabilities could be significant, and, if we are unable to exclude them from the acquisition transaction or successfully obtain indemnification from a third party, they could harm our business and financial condition. In addition, we may face significant challenges in integrating personnel and financial and other systems. Future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, and increased operating expenses, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in divesting assets we wish to sell.\nWe continue to exit service lines, businesses and markets that we believe are no longer strategic to our long-term growth. To that end, since January 1, 2018, we have divested 11 acute care hospitals in the United States, as well as all of our operations in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, in December 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell 87 UCCs from our Hospital Operations and Ambulatory Care segments to an unaffiliated independent urgent care provider, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We cannot provide any assurances that completed, planned or future divestitures or other strategic transactions will achieve their business goals or the benefits we expect.\nWith respect to all proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may fail to obtain applicable regulatory approvals for such divestitures. For example, in the three months ended December 31, 2020, the FTC took action to challenge our planned sale of two Tennessee hospitals to an unaffiliated third party; as a result, we determined in December 2020 that we no longer intend to pursue the transaction. Moreover, we may encounter difficulties in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the receipt of anticipated proceeds necessary for us to complete our planned strategic objectives. In addition, our divestiture activities have required, and may in the future require, us to retain significant pre-closing liabilities, recognize impairment charges (as discussed above) or agree to contractual restrictions that limit our ability to reenter the applicable market, which may be material. Many of our acute care hospital divestitures also necessitate us entering into a transition services agreement with the applicable buyer for information technology and other related services. As a consequence, we may be exposed to the financial status of the buyer for any payments under such transition services agreements, which could be significant.\nFurthermore, our divestiture and other corporate development activities, including the planned spin-off of Conifer (as discussed below), may present financial and operational risks, including (1) the diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, (2) adverse effects (including a deterioration in the related asset or business and, in Conifer\u2019s case, the loss of existing clients and the difficulties associated with securing new clients) from the announcement of the planned or potential activity, and (3) the challenges associated with separating personnel and financial and other systems.\nUSPI and our hospital-based joint ventures depend on existing relationships with key health system partners. If we are unable to maintain historical relationships with these systems, or enter into new relationships, we may be unable to implement our business strategies successfully.\nUSPI and our hospital-based joint ventures depend in part on the efforts, reputations and success of health system partners and the strength of our relationships with those systems. Our joint ventures could be adversely affected by any damage to those health systems\u2019 reputations or to our relationships with them. In addition, damage to our business reputation could negatively impact the willingness of health systems to enter into relationships with us or USPI. If we are unable to maintain existing arrangements on favorable terms or enter into relationships with additional health system partners, we may be unable to implement our business strategies for our joint ventures successfully.\nThe remaining put/call arrangements associated with USPI, if settled in cash, will require us to utilize our cash flow or incur additional indebtedness to satisfy the payment obligations in respect of such arrangements.\nAs part of the formation of USPI in 2015, we entered into a put/call agreement with respect to the equity interests in USPI held by our joint venture partners at that time. During 2016, 2017 and 2018, we paid a total of $1.473 billion to purchase additional shares of USPI to increase our ownership interest in USPI from 50.1% to 95%.\nWe have also entered into a separate put/call agreement (the \u201cBaylor Put/Call Agreement\u201d) with respect to the remaining 5% outside ownership interest in USPI held by Baylor University Medical Center. Each year starting in 2021, Baylor may require us to purchase, or \u201cput\u201d to us, up to 33.3% of their total shares in USPI held as of April 1, 2017 by delivering notice by the end of January of such year. In each year that Baylor does not put the full 33.3% of USPI\u2019s shares allowable, we may call the difference between the number of shares Baylor put and the maximum number of shares they could have put that year. Baylor did not deliver a put notice to us in January 2021. In addition, the Baylor Put/Call Agreement contains a call option pursuant to which we have the ability to acquire all of Baylor\u2019s ownership interest by 2024. In each case, we have the ability to choose whether to settle the purchase price for the Baylor put/call in cash or shares of our common stock.\nPut and call arrangements, to the extent settled in cash, may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to satisfy our payment obligations in respect of such arrangements, which may reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital expenditures and corporate development activities. Similarly, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to satisfy our payment obligations in respect of such arrangements, which could have important consequences to our business and operations, as described more fully below under \u201cOur level of indebtedness could, among other things,\nadversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.\u201d\nOur joint venture arrangements are subject to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have invested in a number of joint ventures with other entities when circumstances warranted the use of these structures, and we may form additional joint ventures in the future. These joint ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve the profitability that justifies the investments made. Furthermore, the nature of a joint venture requires us to consult with and share certain decision-making powers with unaffiliated third parties, some of which may be not-for-profit health systems. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business or strategic plans. In that case, our results could be adversely affected or we may be required to increase our level of financial commitment to the joint venture. Moreover, differences in economic or business interests or goals among joint venture participants could result in delayed decisions, failures to agree on major issues and even litigation. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business or strategic plans, or if our joint venture partners take actions contrary to our policies, objectives or the best interests of the joint venture, our results could be adversely affected. In addition, our relationships with not-for-profit health systems and the joint venture agreements that govern these relationships are intended to be structured to comply with current revenue rulings published by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as case law relevant to joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit healthcare entities. Material changes in these authorities could adversely affect our relationships with not-for-profit health systems and related joint venture arrangements.\nOur participation in joint ventures is also subject to the risks that:\n\u2022We could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes.\n\u2022We may not be able to maintain good relationships with our joint venture partners (including health systems), which could limit our future growth potential and could have an adverse effect on our business strategies.\n\u2022Our joint venture partners could have investment or operational goals that are not consistent with our corporate-wide objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for investments or future growth opportunities.\n\u2022Our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their other obligations as joint venture partners, which may require us to infuse our own capital into any such venture on behalf of the related joint venture partner or partners despite other competing uses for such capital.\n\u2022Many of our existing joint ventures require that one of our wholly owned affiliates provide a working capital line of credit to the joint venture, which could require us to allocate substantial financial resources to the joint venture potentially impacting our ability to fund our other short-term obligations.\n\u2022Some of our existing joint ventures require mandatory capital expenditures for the benefit of the applicable joint venture, which could limit our ability to expend funds on other corporate opportunities.\n\u2022Our joint venture partners may have exit rights that would require us to purchase their interests upon the occurrence of certain events or the passage of certain time periods, which could impact our financial condition by requiring us to incur additional indebtedness in order to complete such transactions or, alternatively, in some cases we may have the option to issue shares of our common stock to our joint venture partners to satisfy such obligations, which would dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. When our joint venture partners seek to exercise their exit rights, we may be unable to agree on the value of their interests, which could harm our relationship with our joint venture partners or potentially result in litigation.\n\u2022Our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.\n\u2022Any sale or other disposition of our interest in a joint venture or underlying assets of the joint venture may require consents from our joint venture partners, which we may not be able to obtain.\n\u2022Certain corporate-wide or strategic transactions may also trigger other contractual rights held by a joint venture partner (including termination or liquidation rights) depending on how the transaction is structured, which could impact our ability to complete such transactions.\n\u2022Our joint venture arrangements that involve financial and ownership relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals or other healthcare facilities are subject to greater regulatory scrutiny from government enforcement agencies. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute, certain of our current arrangements, including joint venture arrangements, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.\nRisks Related to Conifer\nWe cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in completing the proposed spin-off of Conifer.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of the process we have begun to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Conifer. We cannot provide any assurances regarding the timeframe for completing the spin-off, the allocation of assets and liabilities between Tenet and Conifer, that the other conditions of the spin-off will be met, or that the spin-off will be completed at all. We also cannot provide any assurances that the proposed spin-off of Conifer will achieve the business goals or the benefits we expect. Additional risks regarding our divestiture and other corporate development activities, including the planned spin-off of Conifer are described above under \u201cWe cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in divesting assets in non-core markets.\u201d\nA spin-off of Conifer could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nConifer contributes a significant portion of the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows. We have begun to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Conifer. Although there can be no assurance that this process will result in a consummated transaction, any separation of all or a portion of Conifer\u2019s business could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nConifer operates in a highly competitive industry, and its current or future competitors may be able to compete more effectively than Conifer does, which could have a material adverse effect on Conifer\u2019s margins, growth rate and market share.\nAs we pursue a spin-off of Conifer, we are continuing to market Conifer\u2019s revenue cycle management, patient communications and engagement services, and value-based care solutions businesses. The timing and uncertainty associated with our plans for Conifer may have an adverse impact on Conifer\u2019s ability to secure new clients. There can be no assurance that Conifer will be successful in generating new client relationships, including with respect to hospitals we or Conifer\u2019s other clients sell, as the respective buyers of such hospitals may not continue to use Conifer\u2019s services or, if they do, they may not do so under the same contractual terms. The market for Conifer\u2019s solutions is highly competitive, and we expect competition may intensify in the future. Conifer faces competition from existing participants and new entrants to the revenue cycle management market, as well as from the staffs of hospitals and other healthcare providers who handle these processes internally. In addition, electronic medical record software vendors may expand into services offerings that compete with Conifer. To be successful, Conifer must respond more quickly and effectively than its competitors to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulations and client requirements. Moreover, existing or new competitors may introduce technologies or services that render Conifer\u2019s technologies or services obsolete or less marketable. Even if Conifer\u2019s technologies and services are more effective than the offerings of its competitors, current or potential clients might prefer competitive technologies or services to Conifer\u2019s technologies and services. Furthermore, increased competition has resulted and may continue to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact Conifer\u2019s margins, growth rate or market share.\nViolations of existing regulations or failure to comply with new or changed regulations could harm Conifer\u2019s business and financial results.\nConifer and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal, state and local consumer protection and other laws governing such topics as privacy, financial services, and billing and collections activities. Regulations governing Conifer\u2019s operations are subject to changing interpretations that may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. In addition, a regulatory determination made by, or a settlement or consent decree entered into with, one regulatory agency may not be binding upon, or preclude, investigations or regulatory actions by other agencies. Conifer\u2019s failure to comply with applicable consumer protection and other laws could result in, among other things, the issuance of cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), the imposition of fines or\nrefunds, and other civil and criminal penalties, some of which could be significant in the case of knowing or reckless violations. In addition, Conifer\u2019s failure to comply with the statutes and regulations applicable to it could result in reduced demand for its services, invalidate all or portions of some of Conifer\u2019s services agreements with its clients, give clients the right to terminate Conifer\u2019s services agreements with them or give rise to contractual liabilities, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Conifer\u2019s business. Furthermore, if Conifer or its subsidiaries become subject to fines or other penalties, it could harm Conifer\u2019s reputation, thereby making it more difficult for Conifer to retain existing clients or attract new clients.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had approximately $15.7 billion of total long-term debt, as well as $88 million in standby letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate under our senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) and our letter of credit facility agreement (as amended, \u201cLC Facility\u201d). Our Credit Agreement is collateralized by eligible inventory and patient accounts receivable, including receivables for Medicaid supplemental payments, of substantially all of our domestic wholly owned acute care and specialty hospitals, and our LC Facility is guaranteed and secured by a first priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our hospital subsidiaries on an equal ranking basis with our existing senior secured notes. From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital market, bank credit and other financing activities, depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time.\nThe interest expense associated with our indebtedness offsets a substantial portion of our operating income. During 2020, our interest expense was $1.003 billion and represented 50% of our $1.989 billion of operating income. As a result, relatively small percentage changes in our operating income can result in a relatively large percentage change in our net income and earnings per share, both positively and negatively. In addition:\n\u2022Our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\n\u2022We may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business, in the healthcare industry or in the economy generally, or if federal or state governments substantially limit or reduce reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs.\n\u2022Our debt service obligations reduce the amount of funds available for our operations, capital expenditures and corporate development activities, and may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.\n\u2022Our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future capital expenditures, working capital, acquisitions or other needs.\n\u2022Our significant indebtedness may result in the market value of our stock being more volatile, potentially resulting in larger investment gains or losses for our shareholders, than the market value of the common stock of other companies that have a relatively smaller amount of indebtedness.\n\u2022A significant portion of our outstanding debt is subject to early prepayment penalties, such as \u201cmake-whole premiums\u201d; as a result, it may be costly to pursue debt repayment as a deleveraging strategy.\nFurthermore, our Credit Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain, and any future debt obligations may contain, covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and sell assets. See \u201cRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us.\u201d\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors that may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIn addition, our ability to meet our debt service obligations is dependent upon the operating results of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us. We hold most of our assets at, and conduct substantially all of our operations through, direct and indirect subsidiaries. Moreover, we are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations, including payment on our outstanding debt. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries. Our less than wholly owned subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute cash to us in their financing or other agreements and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash flows to service their respective debt obligations.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, including those required for operating our existing facilities, for integrating our historical acquisitions or for future corporate development activities, and such reduction or delay could continue for years. We also may be forced to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our Credit Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us.\nOur Credit Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022provide subsidiary guarantees;\n\u2022consummate asset sales;\n\u2022redeem debt that is subordinated in right of payment to outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In addition, under certain circumstances, the terms of our Credit Agreement require us to maintain a financial ratio relating to our ability to satisfy certain fixed expenses, including interest payments. Our ability to meet this financial ratio and the aforementioned restrictive covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. In addition, a breach of any of these covenants could cause an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay the indebtedness immediately. Under these conditions, we are not certain whether we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make accelerated payments.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more debt or otherwise increase our leverage. This could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement, our LC Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. We may decide to incur additional secured or unsecured debt in the future to finance our operations and any judgments or settlements or for other business purposes. Similarly, if we complete the proposed spin-off of Conifer or continue to sell assets and do not use the proceeds to repay debt, this could further increase our financial leverage.\nOur Credit Agreement provides for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.9 billion, with a $200 million subfacility for standby letters of credit. Based on our eligible receivables, $1.9 billion was available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2020. Our LC Facility provides for the issuance of standby and documentary letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million. At December 31, 2020, we had no cash borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and we had $88 million of standby letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate under the Credit Agreement and the LC Facility. If new indebtedness is added or our leverage increases, the related risks that we now face could intensify.", "PERMNO": 52337, "SIC": 8062, "TIC": "THC"}
