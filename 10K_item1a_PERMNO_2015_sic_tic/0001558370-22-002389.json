Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the global economy. In late 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have been detected in Wuhan, China and on March 11, 2020 it was declared by the World Health Organization to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and increasing volatility, and has impeded global supply chains, restricted manufacturing operations and resulted in significantly reduced economic activity and higher unemployment rates. It has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt for an indefinite period of time, the global vehicle industry and customer sales, production volumes and purchases of automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicles by end-consumers. International, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities have taken and may continue to take actions to contain the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 throughout most regions of the world, including travel bans, quarantines, \"work-from-home\" orders and similar mandates that have caused many businesses to modify normal operations. Beginning in 2020 we took actions to enhance our financial flexibility and minimize the impact on our business, such as the ramping down of certain production facilities in response to customer plant closures and changes in vehicle production schedules, imposing certain travel restrictions, amending our existing Credit Facility twice providing covenant relief through March 2023 and actively managing costs, capital spending and working capital to further strengthen our liquidity. Despite these measures, the ultimate impact to our business continues to remain highly uncertain and we have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in the production and distribution of our products, supply chain disruptions impacting the availability of production materials and the loss or delay of customers\u2019 sales.\nUncertain Economic and Market Conditions\nOur business is cyclical and a downturn in the automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets as well as overall economic conditions could reduce our sales and profitability.\nThe demand for products is largely dependent on the domestic and foreign production of automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicles. The markets for our products have been cyclical, because new vehicle demand is dependent on, among other things, consumer spending and is tied closely to the overall strength of the economy. Because the majority of our products are used principally in the production of vehicles for the automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets, our net sales, and therefore our results of operations, are significantly dependent on the general state of the economy and other factors which affect these markets.\nIn 2021, approximately 92% of our net sales were derived from automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets while approximately 8% were derived from aftermarket distributors, mass merchandisers and monitoring services markets.\nDue to the overall global economic conditions in 2021 and 2020, largely as a result of COVID-19 pandemic and resulting supply chain issues, the automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets experienced a decline in global customer sales and production volumes. As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from our customers in certain regions. An economic downturn or other adverse industry conditions that result in a decline in automotive, commercial, off-highway or agricultural vehicle production, or a material decline in market share by our significant customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss or insolvency of any of our principal customers would adversely affect our future results.\nWe are dependent on several principal customers for a significant percentage of our net sales. In 2021, our top five customers were Volvo, VW Group, Ford Motor Company, PACCAR and American Axle which comprised 9%, 9%, 8%, 6% and 6% of our net sales, respectively. In 2021, our top ten customers accounted for 55% of our net sales. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we have significant receivable balances related to these customers and other major customers that would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy.\nThe Company\u2019s estimated sourced future sales from awarded programs may not be realized.\nThe Company typically enters into customer agreements at the beginning of a vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill customer-purchasing requirements for the entire vehicle production life cycle. The vehicle life cycle typically included the two to four year pre-production period and production for a term covering the life of such vehicle model or platform, generally between three to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. The Company\u2019s customers make no firm commitments regarding volume and may terminate these agreements or orders at any time. Therefore, these arrangements do not represent firm orders. The Company\u2019s estimated sourced future sales from awarded programs, also referred to as backlog, is the estimated remaining cumulative awarded life-of-program sales for up to a five year period. Several factors may change forecasted revenue from awarded programs; namely, new business wins, vehicle production volume changes, customer price reductions, foreign currency exchange rates, component take rates by customers and short cycled or cancelled models or platforms.\nWe must implement and sustain a competitive technological advantage in producing our products to compete effectively.\nOur products are subject to changing technology, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative products introduced by competitors. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet customers\u2019 changing specifications with respect to technological innovation, price, quality, performance, service and delivery by implementing and sustaining competitive technological advances. Our business may, therefore, require significant recurring additional capital expenditures and investment in product development, manufacturing and management information systems. We cannot assure that we will be able to achieve technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive. Our inability to continuously improve existing products, to develop new products and to achieve technological advances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe discontinuation of, loss of business or lack of commercial success, with respect to a particular vehicle model for which the Company is a significant supplier could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm its profitability.\nAlthough the Company has purchase orders from many of its customers, these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer\u2019s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer\u2019s requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. In addition, it is possible that our customers could elect to manufacture components internally that are currently produced by outside suppliers, such as our Company. The discontinuation of, the loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which the Company is a significant supplier, could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe financial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative effect on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and expose us to risks.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $164.0 million in borrowings outstanding on our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). In addition, we are permitted under our Credit Facility to incur additional debt, subject to specified limitations. Our leverage and the terms of our indebtedness may have important consequences including the following:\n\u25cf we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and if we fail to comply with these requirements, an event of default could result;\n\u25cf we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate activities;\n\u25cf covenants relating to our debt may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate activities;\n\u25cf covenants relating to our debt may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u25cf we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors.\nThese and other consequences of our leverage and the terms of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCovenants in our Credit Facility may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nOur Credit Facility limits our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur additional debt and guarantees;\n\u25cf pay dividends and repurchase our shares;\n\u25cf make other restricted payments, including investments;\n\u25cf create liens;\n\u25cf sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital shares of subsidiaries;\n\u25cf enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries;\n\u25cf consolidate, merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u25cf substantially change the nature of our business.\nOn February 28, 2022, we amended the Credit Facility. As amended the Credit Facility provides for certain financial covenant relief and additional covenant restrictions during the \u201cSpecified Period\u201d (the period from February 28, 2022 until the date that the Company delivers a compliance certificate for the quarter ending March 31, 2023 in form and substance satisfactory to the administrative agent). During the Specified Period:\n\u25cf the maximum net leverage ratio is changed to 4.0x for the year ended December 31, 2021, suspended for the quarters ending March 31, 2022 through September 30, 2022 and cannot exceed 4.75 to 1.00 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 or 3.50 to 1.00 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023;\n\u25cf the minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.50 is reduced to 2.50 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, 2.25 for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and 3.00 for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022;\n\u25cf an additional condition to drawing on the Credit Facility has been added that restricts borrowings if the Company\u2019s total of 100% of domestic and 65% of foreign cash and cash equivalents exceeds $70.0 million;\n\u25cf there are certain additional restrictions on Restricted Payments (as defined); and\n\u25cf a Permitted Acquisition (as defined) may not be consummated unless the net leverage ratio is below 3.50x during the Specified Period.\nFollowing the Specified Period, the agreement governing our Credit Facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00, and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00. Our ability to comply with these covenants as well as the negative covenants under the terms of our indebtedness, may be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of any of the negative covenants under our indebtedness or our inability to comply with the leverage and interest ratio requirements in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Facility could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings, and the Credit Facility lenders could pursue foreclosure and other remedies against us and our assets.\nOur annual effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in the mix of earnings and other factors including changes in the recognition and/or release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets.\nOur overall effective tax rate is computed by dividing our total tax expense (benefit) by our total earnings (loss) before tax. However, tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis, but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in certain jurisdictions may not provide a current financial statement tax benefit as a result of the need to maintain a valuation allowance against the associated deferred tax asset. Also, management periodically evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets which may result in the recognition and/or release of valuation allowances. As a result, changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions and changes in the recognition and/or release of valuation allowances, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate.\nRisks Related to Products, Pricing and Supply\nWe are dependent on the availability and price of raw materials and other supplies.\nWe require substantial amounts of raw materials and other supplies, and substantially all such materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The availability and prices of raw materials and other supplies may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers and interruptions in production by suppliers, weather emergencies, natural disasters, commercial disputes, acts of terrorism or war, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. If demand for raw materials we require increases, we may have difficulties obtaining adequate raw materials and other supplies from our suppliers to satisfy our customers. Currently, and at times in the past, we have experienced difficulty obtaining adequate supplies of semiconductors and memory chips. In addition, there have been challenges at times in obtaining timely supply of nylon and resins for our Control Devices segment and audio component parts for our Stoneridge Brazil segment. If we cannot obtain adequate raw materials and other supplies, or if we experience an increase in the price of raw materials and other supplies, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant vehicle production slowdown in the first half of 2020, which was followed by increased consumer demand and vehicle production schedules in the second half of 2020. This surge in demand led to a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage at the end of 2020 and throughout 2021, as semiconductor suppliers have been unable to rapidly reallocate production lines to serve the transportation industry. In addition, we have experienced longer lead-times, higher costs and delays in procuring other component parts and raw materials. As a result, we are currently experiencing supply chain disruptions. We are assessing the potential supply chain impacts, which may directly or indirectly impact various suppliers, and correspondingly, OEM production. We are working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts, and we continue to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials, customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise, due to this or any other issue. However, any direct or indirect supply chain disruptions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe prices that we can charge our customers are typically predetermined and we bear the risk of costs in excess of our estimates, in addition to the risk of adverse effects resulting from general customer demands for cost reductions and quality improvements.\nOur supply agreements with our customers typically require us to provide our products at predetermined prices. In some cases, these prices decline over the course of the contract and may require us to meet certain productivity and cost reduction targets. In addition, our customers may require us to share productivity savings in excess of our cost reduction targets. The costs that we incur in fulfilling these contracts may vary substantially from our initial estimates. Unanticipated cost increases or the inability to meet certain cost reduction targets may occur as a result of several factors, including increases in the costs of labor, components or materials. In some cases, we are permitted to pass on to our customers the cost increases associated with specific materials. However, cost overruns that we cannot pass on to our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOEM customers have exerted and continue to exert considerable pressure on component suppliers to reduce costs, improve quality and provide additional design and engineering capabilities and continue to demand and receive price reductions and measurable increases in quality through their use of competitive selection processes, rating programs and various other arrangements. We may be unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset required price reductions. Additionally, OEMs have generally required component suppliers to provide more design engineering input at earlier stages of the product development process, the costs of which have, in some cases, been absorbed by the suppliers. Future price reductions, increased quality standards and additional engineering capabilities required by OEMs may reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have limited or no redundancy for certain of our manufacturing facilities, and therefore damage or disruption to those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.\nIf certain of our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products for any reason, we may be unable to meet production requirements, we may lose revenue and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our customers. Without operation of certain existing production facilities, we may be limited in our ability to deliver products until we restore the manufacturing capability at the particular facility, find an alternative manufacturing facility or arrange an alternative source of supply. We carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate, however, this insurance does not cover all possible situations and may be insufficient. Also, our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them.\nWe rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell certain products in the aftermarket sales channel and a disruption to this channel would harm our business.\nBecause we sell certain products such as security accessories and driver information products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. If dealers and distributors do not maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.\nOur dealer network also sells products offered by our competitors. If our competitors offer our dealers more favorable terms, those dealers may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. Our inability to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors, or to expand our distribution channels, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Global Positioning Systems (\u201cGPS\u201d) products depend upon satellites maintained by the United States Department of Defense. If a significant number of these satellites become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced, or if the policies of the United States government for the use of the GPS without charge are changed, our business will suffer.\nThe GPS is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense. The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.\nIf a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our GPS products and the growth of market opportunities. In addition, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of GPS satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the U.S. government that provide for the use of the GPS without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged. Because of the increasing commercial applications of the GPS, other U.S. government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of GPS signals. Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select GPS-based products instead of products based on competing technologies, which could adversely affect our operational revenues, financial condition and results of operation.\nGeopolitical Uncertainties\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations.\nApproximately 49% of our net sales in 2021 were derived from sales outside of North America. At December 31, 2021, significant concentrations of net assets outside of North America included $238.2 million in Europe and Other and $32.2 million in South America. Non-current assets outside of North America accounted for approximately 64% of our non-current assets as of December 31, 2021. International sales and operations are subject to significant risks, including, among others:\n\u25cf political and economic instability;\n\u25cf restrictive trade policies;\n\u25cf economic conditions in local markets;\n\u25cf currency exchange rates and controls;\n\u25cf labor unrest;\n\u25cf difficulty in obtaining distribution support and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u25cf the imposition of product tariffs and the burden of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. export laws.\nWe operate our business on a global basis and policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.\nWe manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products. Changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, cause non-U.S. customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S. trade relationship with China and Brazil and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could adversely impact our production costs, customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nStrategic Performance Risks\nOur inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn connection with the award of new business, we obligate ourselves to deliver new products and services that are subject to our customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order for the program launches of our products to be successful. Given the complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp-up of costs; however, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers\u2019 introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions into our business or may otherwise be unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions.\nFailure to successfully identify, complete and/or integrate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on us. A portion of our growth in sales and earnings has been generated from acquisitions and subsequent improvements in the performance of the businesses acquired. We expect to continue a strategy of selectively identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products. We cannot assure you that any business acquired by us will be successfully integrated with our operations or prove to be profitable. We could incur substantial indebtedness in connection with our acquisition strategy, which could significantly increase our interest expense.\nWe anticipate that acquisitions could occur in foreign markets in which we do not currently operate. As a result, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Any failure to successfully integrate such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nProduct Liability Risks\nIncreased or unexpected product warranty claims could adversely affect us.\nWe typically provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects and adhere to customer specifications. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated or compelled, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties, which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs. We maintain warranty reserves in an amount based on historical trends of units sold and costs incurred, combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims. To estimate the warranty reserves, we must forecast the resolution of existing claims, as well as expected future claims on products previously sold. The costs of claims estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what we may ultimately be required to pay. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations, our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may incur material product liability costs.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death and we cannot assure that we will not experience material product liability losses in the future. We cannot assure that our product liability insurance will be adequate for liabilities ultimately incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in government-imposed or customer OEM-instituted recalls involving such products. A successful claim brought against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in any product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property or are found liable for infringing the rights of others, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and license agreements, are important in the operation of our businesses, and we rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the United States and other countries, as well as nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. We may not, however, be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property, breaching any nondisclosure agreements with us, or independently developing technology that is similar or superior to ours and not covered by our intellectual property. Any of the foregoing could reduce any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. We cannot assure that any intellectual property will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged, rejected, cancelled, invalidated or declared unenforceable. In the case of pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing issued patents, or securing patents that provide us with a competitive advantage for our businesses. In addition, our competitors may design products around our patents that avoid infringement and violation of our intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot be certain that we have rights to all intellectual property currently used in the conduct of our businesses or that we have complied with the terms of agreements by which we acquire such rights, which could expose us to infringement, misappropriation or other claims alleging violations of third party intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted and may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims regarding intellectual property rights of others, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our resources. Any such claims and resulting litigation could require us to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all), pay damages and cease making or selling certain products and could result in a loss of our intellectual property protection. Moreover, in such a situation, we may need to redesign some of our products to avoid future infringement liability. We also may be required to indemnify customers or other third parties at significant expense in connection with such claims and actions. The Company has seen an increase in customer requests for indemnification in connection with third party patent claims related to connectivity-enabled products. These claims are being made by patent-holders seeking royalties and who may enter into litigation based on patent infringement allegations. The Company has taken actions to mitigate this risk from new programs, however, significant indemnification claims related to these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\nA failure of our information technology (IT) networks and systems, or the inability to successfully implement upgrades to our enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and/or activities. The secure operation of these IT networks and systems and the proper processing and maintenance of this information are critical to our business operations.\nAlso, we continually expand and update our IT networks and systems in response to the changing needs of our business and periodically upgrade our ERP systems. Should our networks or systems not be implemented successfully, or if the systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner once implementation is complete, our business and operations could be disrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results.\nWe may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems and cybersecurity.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and manage and operate our business. Despite the implementation of security measures, our IT networks and systems are at risk to damages from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. A breach in security could expose us and our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations. While we have taken steps to protect the Company from cybersecurity risks and security breaches (including enhancing our firewall, workstation, email security and network monitoring and alerting capabilities, and training employees around phishing, malware and other cybersecurity risks), and we have policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions, and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. Although we rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from all potential compromises or breaches of security. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nPrivacy and security concerns relating to the Company\u2019s current or future products and services could damage its reputation and deter current and potential users from using them.\nWe may gain access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, our financial condition or operating results. Furthermore, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning cybersecurity and data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. Complying with these various laws could cause the Company to incur substantial costs.\nEnvironmental, Climate and Weather Risks\nCompliance with environmental and other governmental regulations could be costly and require us to make significant expenditures.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things:\n\u25cf the discharge of pollutants into the air and water;\n\u25cf the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste and other materials;\n\u25cf the cleanup of contaminated properties; and\n\u25cf the health and safety of our employees.\nOur business, operations and facilities are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines for violations. The operation of our manufacturing facilities entails risks and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these operations. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and requirements or other governmental regulations could increase our cost of doing business or adversely affect the demand for our products.", "PERMNO": 85440, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "SRI"}
