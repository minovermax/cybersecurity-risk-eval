{"cik": "1101680", "company": "ZHONE TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and our stock price may continue to be volatile.\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenues for a particular quarter are difficult to predict. Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. The primary factors that may affect our results of operations include the following:\n\u2022\ncommercial acceptance of our SLMS and other products and services;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for network access products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of orders from customers;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to finance their purchase of our products as well as their own operations;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions, enhancements or announcements by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and ship new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our company and our contract manufacturers to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components;\n\u2022\nincreases in the prices of the components we purchase, or quality problems associated with these components;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in regulatory requirements which may require us to redesign portions of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules, such as recording expenses for employee stock option grants;\n\u2022\nintegrating and operating any acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve targeted cost reductions;\n\u2022\nhow well we execute on our strategy and operating plans; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions as well as those specific to the communications, internet and related industries.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price. During recent years our stock price has been volatile, ranging from a low of $0.40 to a high of $6.62 since December 31, 2011, and we anticipate that our stock price and trading volume may continue to be volatile in the future, whether due to the factors described above, volatility in public stock markets generally (particularly in the technology sector) or otherwise.\nBetween October 2011 and July 2013, the bid price for our common stock traded below the $1.00 minimum per share bid price required for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2), and we received letters from The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, requiring us to regain compliance within a specified period. A failure to regain compliance could result in our stock being delisted, subject to a right of appeal. In August 2013, we received written notification from Nasdaq advising us that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule as the closing bid price of our common stock had been $1.00 per share or greater for ten consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that our stock price will remain above the minimum bid price or that we will be able to regain compliance if our stock price falls below the minimum bid price again in the future. In addition, if our average market capitalization falls below the carrying value of our assets for an extended period of time as it has done during recent years, this may indicate that the fair value of our net assets is below their carrying value, and may result in recording impairment charges.\nWe have experienced significant losses and we may incur losses in the future. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our profitability, our stock price could decline.\nWe have incurred significant losses to date and expect that our operating losses and negative cash flows from operations may continue. Our net loss was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and we had an accumulated deficit of $1,041.0 million at December 31, 2014. We have significant fixed expenses and expect that we will continue to incur substantial manufacturing, research and product development, sales and marketing, customer support, administrative and other expenses in connection with the ongoing development of our business. In addition, we may be required to spend more on research and product development than originally budgeted to respond to industry trends. We may also incur significant new costs related to acquisitions and the integration of new technologies and other acquisitions that may occur in the future. We may not be able to adequately control costs and expenses or achieve or maintain adequate operating margins. As a result, our ability to sustain profitability in future periods will depend on our ability to generate and sustain higher revenue while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability in future periods, we may continue to incur operating losses, which could be substantial, and our stock price could decline.\nWe have significant debt obligations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $10.0 million of total debt outstanding under our $25.0 million revolving line of credit and letter of credit facility (the WFB Facility) with Wells Fargo Bank (WFB), of which all was current. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, $3.0 million was committed as security for various letters of credit under the WFB Facility. We expect to make borrowings from time to time under the WFB Facility. The WFB Facility includes covenants, restrictions and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. Our debt obligations could materially and adversely affect us in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or market conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to use a significant portion of any future cash flow from operations to repay or service the debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and increases in interest rates.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to engage in any of these actions on reasonable terms, if at all.\nIf we default under the WFB Facility because of a covenant breach or otherwise, WFB may be entitled to, among other things, require the immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts and sell our assets to satisfy the obligations under the WFB Facility. We were in compliance with our covenants under our WFB Facility as of December 31, 2014. In 2010, we failed to satisfy a financial covenant under our former revolving line of credit and letter of credit facility. Although we were able to obtain a waiver with respect to that default, we cannot give assurances that we will be able to obtain a waiver should a default occur under our WFB Facility in the future. Any acceleration of amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional capital to fund our existing and future operations, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development, and marketing and sales efforts, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe development and marketing of new products, and the expansion of our direct sales operations and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources. We may incur significant losses or expend significant amounts of capital if:\n\u2022\nthe market for our products develops more slowly than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe fail to establish market share or generate revenue at anticipated levels;\n\u2022\nour capital expenditure forecasts change or prove inaccurate; or\n\u2022\nwe fail to respond to unforeseen challenges or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities.\nAs a result, we may need to raise substantial additional capital. Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If additional capital is raised through the issuance of debt securities or other debt financing, the terms of such debt may include covenants, restrictions and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. In addition, volatility in our stock price may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities. If we elect to raise equity capital, this may be dilutive to existing stockholders and could reduce the trading price of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain additional capital or are required to obtain additional capital on terms that are not favorable to us, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts beyond the reductions that we have previously taken, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur lack of liquid funds and other sources of financing may limit our ability to maintain our existing operations, grow our business and compete effectively.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $11.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $10.0 million outstanding under our bank lending facility. Our current lack of liquidity could harm us by:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions in our industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nrequiring substantial amounts of cash to be used for debt servicing, rather than other purposes, including operations;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\ninfluencing investor and customer perceptions about our financial stability and limiting our ability to obtain financing or acquire customers.\nIn order to meet our liquidity needs and finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs for our business, we may be required to sell assets, issue debt or equity securities, or borrow on potentially unfavorable terms. In addition, we may be required to reduce our operations in low margin regions, including reductions in headcount. We may be unable to sell assets, access additional indebtedness or undertake other actions to meet these needs. As a result, we may become unable to pay our ordinary expenses, including our debt service, on a timely basis. If additional capital is raised through the issuance of debt securities or other debt financing, the terms of such debt may include covenants, restrictions and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. Likewise, any equity financing could result in additional dilution of our stockholders. If we are unable to sell assets, issue securities or access additional indebtedness to meet these needs on favorable terms, or at all, we may become unable to pay our ordinary expenses, including our debt service, on a timely basis and may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts beyond the reductions we have previously taken. In addition, we may be required to reduce our operations in low margin regions, including reductions in headcount. In addition, we may not be able to fund our business expansion, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and future operating results are subject to global economic and market conditions.\nMarket turbulence and weak economic conditions, as well as concerns about energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, business and consumer confidence, and unemployment could impact our business in a number of ways, including:\nPotential deferment of purchases and orders by customers: Uncertainty about global economic conditions may cause consumers, businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to flat revenue budgets, tighter credit, decreased cash availability and weak consumer confidence. Accordingly, future demand for our products could differ materially from our current expectations.\nCustomers\u2019 inability to obtain financing to make purchases from Zhone and/or maintain their business: Some of our customers require substantial financing in order to finance their business operations, including capital expenditures on new equipment and equipment upgrades, and make purchases from Zhone. The potential inability of these customers to access the capital needed to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. To sell to some of these customers, we may be required to assume incremental risks of uncollectible accounts or to extend credit or credit support. While we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate\nmeasures to protect ourselves, including factoring credit arrangements to financial institutions, it is possible that we may have to defer revenue until cash is collected or write-down or write-off uncollectible accounts. Such write-downs or write-offs, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If our customers become insolvent due to market and economic conditions or otherwise, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on third-party dealers, distributors and retailers: We make sales in certain regions through third-party dealers, distributors and retailers. These third parties may be impacted, among other things, by a significant decrease in available credit. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for these third parties and we are unable to successfully transition end customers to purchase our products from other third parties, or from us directly, it could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on key suppliers: Our ability to meet customers\u2019 demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components from our suppliers. Certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, credit constraints of key suppliers could result in accelerated payment of accounts payable by Zhone, impacting our cash flow.\nWe may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition as a result of weak or recessionary economic or market conditions in the United States or the rest of the world.\nIf demand for our SLMS products in our core or our FiberLAN business does not develop as we anticipate, then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nOur future revenue depends significantly on our ability to successfully develop, enhance and market our SLMS products to the network service provider market in our core business. Most network service providers have made substantial investments in their current infrastructure, and they may elect to remain with their current architectures or to adopt new architectures, such as SLMS, in limited stages or over extended periods of time. A decision by a customer to purchase our SLMS products will involve a significant capital investment. We must convince our service provider customers that they will achieve substantial benefits by deploying our products for future upgrades or expansions.\nWe commenced our FiberLAN business in 2012 with the launch of our FiberLAN Passive Optical LAN product, which provides an alternative to switched copper-based LANs. The success of our FiberLAN business depends on our ability to market and sell our FiberLAN Passive Optical LAN product to the enterprise market, including hospitality, government, education, manufacturing and business enterprises. We may be unsuccessful in implementing our business plan for our FiberLAN business, or we may not be able to achieve the revenue that we expect from our FiberLAN business. We may experience difficulties with product reliability, partnering, and sales and marketing efforts that could adversely affect our FiberLAN business and divert management attention and resources from our core business.\nWe do not know whether a viable market for our SLMS products will develop or be sustainable in our core and FiberLAN businesses. If these markets do not develop or develop more slowly than we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers\u2019 changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in end-user requirements, frequent new product introductions and changes in communications offerings from network service provider customers. Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes and to offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, products that meet changing customer demands and industry standards. We may not have sufficient resources to successfully and accurately anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and technological trends, manage long development cycles or develop, introduce and market new products and enhancements. The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to develop new products or enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if our new products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our products are complex and are deployed in complex environments, our products may have defects that we discover only after full deployment by our customers, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software typically contains defects or programming flaws that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. In addition, our products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large quantities across complex networks. Because of the nature of these products, they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in large networks with high amounts of traffic, and there is no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects. As a result, our customers may discover errors or defects in our hardware or software, or our products may not operate as expected, after they have been fully deployed by our customers. If we are unable to cure a product defect, we could experience damage to our reputation, reduced customer satisfaction, loss of existing customers and failure to attract new customers, failure to achieve market acceptance, reduced sales opportunities, loss of revenue and market share, increased service and warranty costs, diversion of development resources, legal actions by our customers, and increased insurance costs. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products could also result in financial or other damages to our customers. Our customers could seek damages for related losses from us, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly. The occurrence of any of these problems would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component inventories that could adversely affect our gross margins.\nOccasionally, we may experience a supply shortage, or a delay in receiving, certain component parts as a result of strong demand for the component parts and/or capacity constraints or other problems experienced by suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. Conversely, we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. In the past we experienced component shortages that adversely affected our financial results and in the future may continue to experience component shortages.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers for a portion of our manufacturing requirements.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to perform a portion of the manufacturing operations for our products. These contract manufacturers build product for other companies, including our competitors. In addition, we do not have contracts in place with some of these providers and may not be able to effectively manage those relationships. We cannot be certain that our contract manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. We face a number of risks associated with this dependence on contract manufacturers including reduced control over delivery schedules, the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand, poor manufacturing yields and high costs, quality assurance, increases in prices, and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, problems with our contract manufacturers, such as inferior quality, insufficient quantities and late delivery of products.\nWe depend on a limited source of suppliers for several key components. If we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements, which would harm our business.\nWe currently purchase several key components from a limited number of suppliers. If any of our limited source of suppliers become insolvent, cease business or experience capacity constraints, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our delivery schedules. Our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, be acquired by our competitors, stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices, refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price or be unable to obtain or have difficulty obtaining components for their products from their suppliers. If we do not receive critical components from our limited source of suppliers in a timely manner, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements. Any failure to meet a customer\u2019s delivery requirements could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.\nOur target customer base is concentrated, and the loss of one or more of our customers could harm our business.\nThe target customers for our products are network service providers that operate voice, data and video communications networks. There are a limited number of potential customers in our target market. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, three customers represented 31% and 33% of net revenue, respectively. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will depend on sales of our products to a limited number of customers. As a result, our revenue for any quarter may be subject to significant volatility based on changes in orders from one or a small number of key customers. Any failure of one or more customers to purchase products from us for any reason, including any downturn in their businesses, would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition.\nWe currently have international operations consisting of sales and technical support teams in various locations around the world. We expect to continue expanding our international operations in the future. The successful management and expansion of our international operations requires significant human effort and the commitment of substantial financial resources. Further, our international operations may be subject to certain risks and challenges that could harm our operating results, including:\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products into or from various countries;\n\u2022\npolitical considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards or customer requirements;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and customizing our products for foreign countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection cycles and financial instability of customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and excessive costs for staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and economic conditions.\nAny of these factors could harm our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in the communications equipment market for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, rapid consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of customers we serve. Loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market we serve is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nCompetition in the communications equipment market is intense. This market is characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages. We are aware of many companies in related markets that address particular aspects of the features and functions that our products provide. Currently, our primary competitors in our core business include Alcatel-Lucent, Calix, Adtran, Huawei, and ZTE, among others. In our FiberLAN business, our competitors include Tellabs and Cisco. We also may face competition from other large communications equipment companies or other companies that may enter our market in the future. In addition, a number of companies have introduced products that address the same network needs that our products address, both domestically and abroad. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more customer financing than we can. In particular, we are encountering price-focused competitors from Asia, especially China, which places pressure on us to reduce our prices. If we are forced to reduce prices in order to secure customers, we may be unable to sustain gross margins at desired levels or achieve profitability. Competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing\nexpenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that render our products less valuable or obsolete.\nIn our markets, principal competitive factors include:\n\u2022\nproduct performance;\n\u2022\ninteroperability with existing products;\n\u2022\nscalability and upgradeability;\n\u2022\nconformance to standards;\n\u2022\nbreadth of services;\n\u2022\nreliability;\n\u2022\nease of installation and use;\n\u2022\ngeographic footprints for products;\n\u2022\nability to provide customer financing;\n\u2022\nprice;\n\u2022\ntechnical support and customer service; and\n\u2022\nbrand recognition.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, we may have difficulty obtaining or retaining customers, and we could experience price reductions, order cancellations, increased expenses and reduced gross margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to retain and recruit key personnel, and any failure to do so would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur future success depends upon the continued services of James Norrod, our President and Chief Executive Officer\nand our other executive officers, as well as the continued chairmanship of our Board by Morteza Ejabat (our co-founder), our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to build our business. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, or the loss of Mr. Ejabat as our Executive Chairman, could delay the development and production of our products and negatively impact our ability to maintain customer relationships, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny strategic acquisitions or investments we make could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had acquired twelve companies or product lines since we were founded in 1999. Further, we may acquire additional businesses, products or technologies in the future. On an ongoing basis, we may evaluate acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary companies, products or technologies to supplement our internal growth. Also, in the future, we may encounter difficulties identifying and acquiring suitable acquisition candidates on reasonable terms.\nIf we do complete future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nconsume a substantial portion of our cash resources;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities;\n\u2022\nincrease our ongoing operating expenses and level of fixed costs;\n\u2022\nrecord goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincur large and immediate write-offs; and\n\u2022\nbecome subject to litigation.\nAny acquisitions or investments that we make in the future will involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans.\nMergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We do not know whether we will be able to successfully integrate the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or that any strategic investments we make will meet our financial or other investment objectives. Any failure to do so could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSales to communications service providers are especially volatile, and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nSales activity in the service provider industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures, the availability of funding, and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic and business conditions in the country of operations. Although some service providers may be increasing capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years, weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Slowdowns in the general economy, overcapacity, changes in the service provider market, regulatory developments and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers, with many of these customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results, and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of service including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of our products. In addition, such regulations could require us to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the redesign of any non-compliant product. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. For example, in 2003 the European Union enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), for implementation in European Union member states. We are aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or is being considered in the United States, as well as other countries, such as Japan and China. Our failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being liable for costs, fines, penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries in the jurisdictions where these regulations apply.\nAdverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are a party to various lawsuits and claims in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property rights may prove difficult to protect and enforce.\nWe generally rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as extensively as in the United States. We cannot assure you that our pending, or any future, patent applications will be granted, that any existing or future patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any existing or future patents will be enforceable. While we are not dependent on any individual patents, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time and effort required to create the innovative products.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly and time consuming to defend and could limit our ability to use some technologies in the future.\nThird parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. The asserted claims or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products, or components of those products. We have received correspondence from companies claiming that many of our products are using technology covered by or related to the intellectual property rights of these companies and inviting us to discuss licensing arrangements for the use of the technology. Regardless of the merit of these claims, intellectual property litigation can be time consuming and costly, and result in the diversion of technical and management personnel. Any such litigation could force us to stop selling, incorporating or using our products that include the challenged intellectual property, or redesign those products that use the technology. In\naddition, if a party accuses us of infringing upon its proprietary rights, we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in any such litigation, we could be subject to significant liability for damages and loss of our proprietary rights. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the availability of third party licenses.\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various elements of the technology used to develop these products. We cannot assure you that our existing and future third-party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our inability to maintain or obtain any third-party license required to sell or develop our products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, or at greater cost.\nThe long and variable sales cycles for our products may cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe target customers for our products have substantial and complex networks that they traditionally expand in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, our marketing efforts are focused primarily on prospective customers that may purchase our products as part of a large-scale network deployment. Our target customers typically require a lengthy evaluation, testing and product qualification process. Throughout this process, we are often required to spend considerable time and incur significant expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about the uses and features of our products. Even after a company makes the final decision to purchase our products, it may deploy our products over extended periods of time. The timing of deployment of our products varies widely, and depends on a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 skill sets, geographic density of potential subscribers, the degree of configuration and integration required to deploy our products, and our customers\u2019 ability to finance their purchase of our products as well as their operations. As a result of any of these factors, our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nDecreased effectiveness of share-based compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.\nWe have historically used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation program in order to align the interests of our employees with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages. If the trading price of our common stock declines, this would reduce the value of our share-based compensation to our present employees and could affect our ability to retain existing or attract prospective\nemployees. Difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could also make it harder or more expensive for us to grant share-based payments to employees in the future.\nOur industry is subject to government regulations, which could harm our business.\nOur operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including those regulations promulgated by the FCC. The FCC has jurisdiction over the entire communications industry in the United States and, as a result, our existing and future products and our customers\u2019 products are subject to FCC rules and regulations. Changes to current FCC rules and regulations and future FCC rules and regulations could negatively affect our business. The uncertainty associated with future FCC decisions may cause network service providers to delay decisions regarding their capital expenditures for equipment for broadband services. In addition, international regulatory bodies establish standards that may govern our products in foreign markets. The SEC has adopted disclosure rules regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals. These rules may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply DRC \u201cconflict free\u201d components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Also, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of government regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted in the future, any of which could negatively impact our operations and costs of doing business. Because of our smaller size, legislation or governmental regulations can significantly increase our costs and affect our competitive position. Changes to or future domestic and international regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of customer orders for our products and services, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals that may, in the future, be required to operate our business.\nThe ability of unaffiliated stockholders to influence key transactions, including changes of control, may be limited by significant insider ownership, provisions of our charter documents and provisions of Delaware law.\nAt December 31, 2014, our executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence substantially all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. Circumstances may arise in which the interests of these stockholders could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. These stockholders could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our other stockholders. In addition, provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to certain stockholders.\nOur business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes and other natural catastrophic events.\nOur corporate headquarters, including a significant portion of our research and development operations, are located in Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, some of our facilities, including our manufacturing facilities, are located near geographic areas that have experienced hurricanes in the past. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood or other catastrophic event, could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 89925, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "DZSI"}
