RISK FACTORS.\nOur future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control. The following issues, uncertainties, and risks, among others, should be considered in evaluating our business and outlook. Also, note that additional risks not currently identified or known to us could also negatively impact our business or financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business is subject to general economic and other factors that are largely out of our control and could affect our operations, profitability and cash flow.\nOur business is dependent on various economic factors over which we have little control, that include:\n\u2022\nthe availability of qualified drivers;\n\u2022\naccess to the credit and capital markets;\n\u2022\nrising healthcare costs;\n\u2022\nincreases in fuel prices, taxes and tolls;\n\u2022\nincreases in costs of equipment;\n\u2022\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nexcess capacity in the trucking industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations or changes in license and regulatory fees;\n\u2022\npotential disruptions at U.S. ports of entry and in pipeline operations;\n\u2022\ndownturns in customers\u2019 business cycles; and\n\u2022\ninsurance prices and insurance coverage availability.\nAs a result, we may experience periods of overcapacity, declining prices, lower profit margins and less availability of cash in the future. Our revenues and operating income could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of increased transportation costs.\nWe would be adversely affected by a decline in demand for hauling petroleum products in our markets.\nWe derive approximately 86% of our revenues from the hauling of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel and ethanol. The demand for these services is determined by motor fuel consumption in our markets, which is affected by general economic conditions, employment levels, consumer confidence, spending patterns and gasoline prices. Demand for our petroleum hauling services is also impacted by vehicle fuel efficiency, the increasing popularity of electric, hybrid or alternative fuel vehicles and government regulation relating to ethanol. The Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy projects that U.S. motor gasoline consumption will decline at an average rate of 1.1% per year between 2012 and 2040 as improvements in fuel efficiency are expected to outpace increases in miles driven.\nFuture legislation or regulations adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as a carbon tax, may increase our operating costs, require unanticipated capital expenditures and reduce the demand for petroleum products. Developments regarding climate change and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change in recent years has increased the likelihood of such legislation or regulation. Moreover, attitudes toward gasoline and its relationship to the environment may significantly affect our sales and ability to market our products. Reduced consumer demand for gasoline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel.\nWe require large amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, cost of fuel (including fuel taxes) represented approximately 13.4%, 15.3%, and 14.5%, respectively, of our total revenue. The market price for fuel can be extremely volatile and can be affected by a number of economic and political factors. In addition, changes in federal or state regulations can impact the price of fuel, as well as increase the amount we pay in fuel taxes.\nWe typically incorporate a fuel surcharge provision in all customer contracts. The intended\neffect of that provision is to neutralize the impacts of fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel on both the Company and our customer. The amount of the fuel surcharge is typically set at the beginning of each month and is based on the actual price of diesel fuel recorded in the preceding month. This provision produces a lag in the timing of the recovery of the price move for both the Company and our customer. However, our customers may be able to negotiate contracts that minimize or eliminate our ability to pass on fuel price increases. If fuel prices increase and we are unable to pass the increased cost to our customers, the additional expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently do not hedge our fuel purchases to protect against fluctuations in fuel prices that are not covered by fuel surcharges, and therefore are at risk to the extent that changes in the market price of fuel are not covered by the fuel surcharge provisions of our customer contracts.\nOur operations may also be adversely affected by any limit on the availability of fuel. Disruptions in the political climate in key oil producing regions in the world, particularly in the event of wars or other armed conflicts, could severely limit the availability of fuel in the United States. In the event our customers face significant difficulty in obtaining fuel, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions.\nOur business is subject to seasonal trends common in the refined petroleum products delivery industry. We typically encounter increased demand for fuels delivery services in Florida during the spring months. Further, operating costs and earnings are generally adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. These factors generally result in lower operating results during the first and second fiscal quarters of the year and cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our operating expenses also have been somewhat higher in the winter months, primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency, increased utility costs and increased maintenance costs for tractors and trailers in colder months. An occurrence of unusually harsh or long-lasting inclement weather could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and competitive pressures may adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nThe tank lines transportation business is extremely competitive and fragmented. We compete with many other carriers of varying sizes as well as our customers\u2019 private fleets. Numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current level of revenues and profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. These factors include the following:\n\u2022 we compete with many other fuels delivery service providers, particularly smaller regional competitors, some of which may have more equipment in, or stronger ties to, the geographic regions in which they operate or other competitive advantages;\n\u2022 some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices, implement new pricing strategies or maintain significant growth in our business;\n\u2022 many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors;\n\u2022 many customers are looking to reduce the number of carriers they use, and in some instances we may not be selected to provide services;\n\u2022 consolidation in the fuels delivery industry could create other large carriers with greater financial resources than we have and other competitive advantages relating to their size;\n\u2022 the development of alternative power sources for cars and trucks could reduce demand for gasoline; and\n\u2022 advances in technology require increased investments to maintain competitiveness, and we may not have the financial resources to invest in technology improvements or our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments.\nIf we are unable to address these competitive pressures, our operations and profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe loss or bankruptcy of one or more significant customers may adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent upon a limited number of large customers. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 63.1% of our total revenues during the year ended September 30, 2019. In particular, our largest customer, Murphy USA, accounted for 19.2% of our total revenues during fiscal 2019. The loss of one or more of our major customers, or a material reduction in services performed for such customers, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if one or more of our customers were to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws, we might not receive payment for services rendered and, under certain circumstances, might have to return payments made by these customers during the 90 days prior to the bankruptcy filing. If we were to lose one or more of our key customers, we might not be able to capture additional volume from other customers to offset the fixed costs historically covered by the lost revenue.\nDifficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could negatively affect our operations and limit our growth.\nThere is substantial competition for qualified personnel, particularly drivers, in the trucking industry. We operate in many geographic areas where there is currently a shortage of drivers. Regulatory requirements, including electronic logging, and an improving U.S. jobs market, could continue to reduce the number of eligible drivers in our markets. Any shortage of drivers could result in temporary under-utilization of our equipment, difficulty in meeting our customers\u2019 demands and increased compensation levels, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A loss of qualified drivers could lead to an increased frequency in the number of accidents, potential claims exposure and, indirectly, insurance costs.\nDifficulty in attracting qualified drivers could also require us to limit our growth. Our strategy is to grow in part by expanding existing customer relationships into new markets. However, we may have difficulty finding qualified drivers on a timely basis when presented with new customer opportunities, which could result in our inability to accept or service this business or could require us to increase the wages we pay in order to attract drivers. If we are unable to hire qualified drivers to service business opportunities in new markets, we may have to temporarily\nsend drivers from existing terminals to those new markets, causing us to incur significant costs relating to out-of-town driver pay and expenses. In making acquisitions and converting private fleets, some of the drivers in those fleets may not meet our standards, which would require us to find qualified drivers to replace them. If we are unable to find and retain such qualified drivers on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to forego opportunities to expand or maintain our business.\nIf our relationship with our employees were to deteriorate, we may be faced with unionization efforts, labor shortages, disruptions or stoppages, which could adversely affect our business and reduce our operating margins and income.\nOur operations rely heavily on our employees, and any labor shortage, disruption or stoppage caused by poor relations with our employees could reduce our operating margins and income. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, although unions have traditionally been active in the U.S. trucking industry. Our workforce has been subject to union organization efforts from time to time, and we could be subject to future unionization efforts as our operations expand. Unionization of our workforce could result in higher compensation and working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility. In addition, we are from time to time subject to wage and hour claims relating to overtime pay where our drivers work more than eight hours in a day but less than 40 hours in a week. We believe we are exempt from overtime pay rules under regulations of the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d). However, our operating costs would increase if this exemption were rescinded or if a court determined that we were not exempt from these overtime pay rules.\nIf we lose key members of our senior management, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy successfully and to operate profitably depends in large part on the continued employment of our senior management team, led by Robert Sandlin, President and CEO. If Mr. Sandlin or the other members of senior management become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop, integrate or upgrade our information technology systems, we may lose customers or incur costs beyond our expectations.\nWe rely heavily on information technology and communications systems to operate our business and manage our network in an efficient manner. We have equipped our tractors with various mobile communications systems and electronic logging devices that enable us to monitor our tractors and communicate with our drivers in the field and enable customers to track the location and monitor the progress of their cargo through the Internet. Despite redundancies and security measures, our information technology and communications systems remain susceptible to outages, computer viruses, break-ins, human error, data leakage and other disruptions and imperfections. Any of these could impair the efficiency of our operations, inhibit our customer service or reduce customer access to information. In addition, there could be a loss of confidential information, corruption of data, or damage to our reputation. Demand for our services or the profitability of operations could in turn be affected, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreasingly, we compete for customers based upon the flexibility and sophistication of our technologies supporting our services. The failure of hardware or software that supports our information technology systems, the loss of data contained in the systems, or the inability of our\ncustomers to access or interact with our website, could significantly disrupt our operations and cause us to lose customers. If our information technology systems are unable to handle additional volume for our operations as our business and scope of service grow, our service levels and operating efficiency will decline. In addition, we expect customers to continue to demand more sophisticated fully-integrated information systems. If we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement and maintain our information technology systems or if we fail to upgrade or replace these systems to handle increased volumes, meet the demands of our customers and protect against disruptions of our operations, we may lose customers, which could seriously harm our business.\nTo compete effectively, we must anticipate and adapt to technology changes. We may choose new technologies that later prove to be inadequate, or may be forced to implement new technologies, at substantial cost, to remain competitive. In addition, competitors may implement new technologies before we do, allowing such competitors to provide lower priced or enhanced services and superior quality compared to those we provide. This development could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete.\nWe are self-insured and/or have deductible exposure to certain claims and are subject to the fluctuations of the insurance marketplace, all of which could affect our profitability.\nThe primary accident risks associated with our business are:\n\u2022\nmotor-vehicle related bodily injury and property damage;\n\u2022\nworkers\u2019 compensation claims;\n\u2022\nenvironmental pollution liability claims;\n\u2022\ncargo loss and damage; and\n\u2022\ngeneral liability claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance for:\n\u2022\nmotor-vehicle related bodily injury and property damage claims;\n\u2022\nworkers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage on our employees; and\n\u2022\ngeneral liability claims.\nOur insurance program included a self-insured deductible of $250,000 per incident for bodily injury, property damage, and workers\u2019 compensation (with a basket at $250,000 for all three) until September 30, 2017. Effective October 1, 2017 our deductible on bodily injury and property damage remained at $250,000 but increased to $500,000 on workers compensation with no basket coverage. In addition, we maintained insurance policies with a total limit of $50 million, of which $49 million was provided under umbrella and excess liability policies and $1 million is provided under a primary liability policy. The $250,000 deductible per incident could adversely affect our profitability, particularly in the event of an increase in the frequency or severity of incidents. Additionally, we are self-insured for damage to the equipment that we own and lease, as well as for cargo losses and such self-insurance is not subject to any maximum limitation. In addition, even where we have insurance, our insurance policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities.\nOur self-insured retentions require us to make estimates of expected loss amounts and accrue such estimates as expenses. Changes in estimates may materially and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, our insurance does not cover claims for punitive damages. As a result of the increase in our self-insured retention, it is likely that we will increase our claims\naccrual as a result of a possible increase in our claims expense.\nWe are subject to changing conditions and pricing in the insurance marketplace that in the future could change dramatically the cost or availability of various types of insurance. To the extent these costs cannot be passed on to our customers in increased prices, increases in insurance costs could reduce our future profitability and cash flow.\nIn addition, our insurance carriers and the states in which we operate require us to post either letters of credit or surety bonds to collateralize our self-insured retention. We currently have letters of credit of $3 million outstanding to satisfy these obligations. If our insurance carriers or the states in which we operate require us to increase the amount of collateral we provide in the future, we could face increased costs, including the payment of additional fees to the providers of letters of credit. Since our letters of credit are considered debt under the financial covenants for our financing arrangements, increases in the amount of letters of credit we have outstanding to collateralize our self-insurance obligations will reduce borrowing availability under our credit agreement and reduce our capacity for additional borrowings.\nMoreover, any accident or incident involving us, even if we are fully insured or not held to be liable, could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future. Because we provide \u201clast mile\u201d fuels delivery services, we generally perform our services in more crowded areas, which increases the possibility of an accident involving our trucks.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could significantly increase our costs of doing business.\nAs a motor carrier, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\u201cFMCSA\u201d) and DOT, and by various federal and state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing various aspects such as operating authority, safety, hours of service, hazardous materials transportation, financial reporting and acquisitions. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment, product-handling requirements and drug testing of drivers. In 2003, Florida Rock & Tank Lines, Inc. underwent a compliance review by the FMCSA in which we retained our satisfactory DOT safety rating. Any downgrade in our DOT safety rating (as a result of new regulations or otherwise) could adversely affect our business.\nThe trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices, emissions or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing trucking services. Possible changes include:\n\u2022\nincreasingly stringent environmental regulations, including changes intended to address climate change;\n\u2022\nrestrictions, taxes or other controls on emissions;\n\u2022\nregulation specific to the energy market and logistics providers to the industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in the hours-of-service regulations, which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period;\n\u2022\ndriver and vehicle electronic logging requirements;\n\u2022\nrequirements leading to accelerated purchases of new tractors;\n\u2022\nmandatory limits on vehicle weight and size;\n\u2022\ndriver hiring restrictions;\n\u2022\nincreased bonding or insurance requirements; and\n\u2022\nmandatory regulations imposed by the Department of Homeland Security.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels and emissions, which may increase our operating costs, require capital expenditures or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers.\nRestrictions on emissions or other climate change laws or regulations could also affect our customers that use significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels in producing or delivering the products we carry. We also could lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements.\nOur business may be adversely affected by terrorist attacks and anti-terrorism measures.\nIn the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and are implementing various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks and fingerprinting of drivers in connection with new hazardous materials endorsements on their licenses. Such measures may have costs associated with them which we are forced to bear. While we believe we are in compliance with these new regulations, if existing requirements are interpreted differently by governmental authorities or additional new security measures are required, the timing of our deliveries may be disrupted and we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Moreover, large trucks containing petroleum products are potential terrorist targets, and we may be obligated to take measures, including possible capital expenditures intended to protect our trucks. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage maintained by us could continue to increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure, or targeting those of our third-party service providers.\nOur business, like other companies in our industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, including technologies that are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. Such technologies are integrated into our business operations. Use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including \"cloud\" computing, exposes all users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks.\nWhile we and our third-party service providers commit resources to the design, implementation, and monitoring of our information systems, there is no guarantee that our security measures will provide absolute security. Despite these security measures, we may not be able to anticipate, detect, or prevent cyberattacks, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until launched, and because attackers are increasingly using techniques designed to circumvent controls and avoid detection. We and our third-party service providers may therefore be vulnerable to security events that are beyond our control, and we may be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as physical attacks, which could result in information security breaches and significant disruption to our business.\nAs cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any information\nOur operations involve hazardous materials and could result in significant environmental liabilities and costs.\nOur activities, which involve the transportation, storage and disposal of fuels and other hazardous substances and wastes, are subject to various federal, state and local health and safety laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including, among others, those governing the transportation, management and disposal of hazardous materials, vehicle emissions, underground and above ground storage tanks and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Our operations involve risks of fuel spillage or seepage, hazardous waste disposal and other activities that are potentially damaging to the environment. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of or liable under applicable laws or regulations, it could significantly increase our cost of doing business.\nMost of our truck terminals are located in industrial areas, where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Under environmental laws, we could be held responsible for the costs relating to any contamination at those or other of our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, including cleanup costs, fines and penalties and personal injury and property damages. Under some of these laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (also known as the Superfund law) and comparable state statutes, liability for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed upon any current or former owner or operator, or upon any party who sent waste to the site, regardless of the lawfulness of any disposal activities or whether a party owned or operated a contaminated property at the time of the release of hazardous substances. From time to time, we have incurred remedial costs and/or regulatory penalties with respect to spills and releases in connection with our operations and, notwithstanding the existence of our environmental management program, such obligations may be incurred in the future. The discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations or liabilities in the future could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or our business reputation.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could also be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. As a result, our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising from such laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements.\nOur business requires substantial ongoing capital investment, particularly for tractors, trailers, terminals and technology. Our capital expenditures were approximately $6.3 million, $4.7 million and $9.6 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $8.4 million during fiscal 2020. We expect that cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be our primary sources of financing for capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or borrow sufficient funds on terms that are acceptable to us, we may be forced to limit our growth and operate existing equipment for significant periods of time, each of which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment on a timely basis. Any delay in delivery of equipment could impair our ability to serve our customers, and, to the extent that we must obtain equipment from alternative sources at increased prices, could result in a significant increase in our anticipated capital expenditures and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancing may not always be available to fund our activities.\nWe usually must spend and risk a significant amount of capital to fund our activities. Although most capital needs are funded from operating cash flow, the timing of cash flows from operations and capital funding needs may not always coincide, and the levels of cash flow may not fully cover capital funding requirements.\nFrom time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. We currently have a revolving credit facility available to us, for up to $35 million of borrowings, to provide us with available financing for working capital, equipment purchases and other general corporate purposes. This credit facility is intended to meet any ongoing cash needs in excess of internally generated cash flows.\nOur revolving credit agreement limits our ability to engage in some business activities.\nOur revolving credit agreement contains customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that will, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make certain investments;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to merge with another company;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nrequire us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and\n\u2022\nprevent us from encumbering certain assets except as approved by the lender.\nThese limitations could cause us to default on our credit agreements or negatively affect our operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nYour percentage of ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or other corporate purposes, including equity awards that we will grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have options to purchase shares of our common stock and we anticipate our compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to our employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the\napproval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nCertain shareholders have effective control of a significant percentage of our common stock and likely will control the outcome of any shareholder vote.\nAs of September 30, 2019, two of our directors, Edward L. Baker and Thompson S. Baker II, beneficially own approximately 7.38% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (57.50% of such shares are held in trusts under which voting power is shared with other family members) and certain of their family members beneficially own an additional 26.07%. As a result, these individuals effectively may have the ability to direct the election of all members of our board of directors and to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations involving us, our acquisition or disposition of assets, our borrowing of monies, our issuance of any additional securities, our repurchase of common stock and our payment of dividends.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of Florida law could delay or prevent a change in control of us.\nThe existence of some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Florida law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a shareholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022\nproviding that our directors may be removed by our shareholders only for cause;\n\u2022\nestablishing supermajority vote requirements for our shareholders to approve certain business combinations;\n\u2022\nestablishing supermajority vote requirements for our shareholders to amend certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and our bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorizing a large number of shares of stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us;\n\u2022\nprohibiting shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders or taking action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nimposing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors at the annual shareholder meetings.\nThese provisions apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our shareholders\u2019 best interests.", "PERMNO": 15144, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "PATI"}
