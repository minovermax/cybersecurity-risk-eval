{"cik": "797465", "company": "HG Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the specific risk factors described below in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and a loss of all or part of your investment.\nWe have no revenue-generating operations and have limited sources of income following the Asset Sale, which may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale, we have no revenue-generating operations and no sources of income other than payments of interest and principal under the subordinated secured promissory notes from Buyer and S&L, any remaining payments to be made to us under the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, refundable alternative minimum tax credits, and repayment at death of premiums we have paid for a split dollar life insurance policy for a former executive officer. As of March 19, 2019, our sources of income also include dividends on HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock and interest paid on the loan we made to HC Realty\u2019s operating partnership. There can be no guarantee that suitable assets in addition to our investment in HC Realty will be available for us to purchase or that any assets acquired will generate the revenues anticipated or any revenue at all. A failure by us to secure additional sources of revenue could negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nWe may not receive the amount owed us under the subordinated secured promissory notes from Buyer and S&L.\nThe promissory note from Buyer will mature, and the entire principal amount will be payable on the date that is five years after the closing of the Asset Sale. Buyer\u2019s obligations under this note, including its payment obligations, and our rights and remedies with respect to the collateral pledged by Buyer under this note may at times be subordinate to Buyer\u2019s obligations under, and the lender\u2019s rights with respect to, Buyer\u2019s senior secured loan facility, including the lender\u2019s rights to the collateral pledged by Buyer in connection with its senior secured loan facility. As a result, there can be no guarantee that Buyer will pay us any portion of the interest or principal due under this note or that upon any default by Buyer we will have access to any of the collateral pledged by Buyer under this note. As of November 5, 2018, the Buyer paid off its initial senior secured loan facility resulting in the senior secured lender releasing all its liens on Buyer\u2019s assets. Thereby, our collateral pledged by Buyer under our promissory note from Buyer was not subordinated as of December 31, 2018. However, Buyer entered into a new senior secured loan facility on February 25, 2019 and our collateral pledged by Buyer under the Second A&R Note became subordinated to Buyer\u2019s obligations, and lenders rights with respect to, Buyer\u2019s new senior secured loan facility.\nThe S&L Note will mature, and the entire principal amount will be payable on, the date that is five years after the closing of the Asset Sale. S&L\u2019s obligations under this note, including its principal payment obligations, and our rights and remedies with respect to the collateral pledged by S&L under this note may at times be subordinate to S&L\u2019s obligations under, and the lender\u2019s rights with respect to, S&L\u2019s senior secured loan facility, including the lenders rights to the collateral pledge by S&L in connection with its senior secured loan facility. As a result, there can be no guarantee that S&L will pay us any portion of the principal due under this note or that upon any default by S&L we will have access to any of the collateral pledged by S&L under this note. As of December 17, 2018, S&L paid off its senior secured loan facility resulting in the senior secured lender releasing all its liens on the S&L\u2019s assets. Thereby, our collateral pledged by S&L under the A&R Note was not subordinated as of December 31, 2018.\nOur investment in HC Realty may lose value.\nIn connection with using cash proceeds from the Asset Sale to acquire non-furniture related assets, we acquired an equity interest in HC Realty on March 19, 2019 by purchasing HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock. As a result of these stock purchases, we currently own approximately 16.7% of the as-converted equity interest of HC Realty. On March 19, 2019, we also made a loan to HC Realty\u2019s operating partnership. There is no guarantee that HC Realty will be successful implementing its business strategy for the acquisition, management and disposition of GSA properties and as a result our HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock may lose value and the repayment of our loan to HC Realty\u2019s operating partnership may be negatively impacted.\nThe value of our equity investment in HC Realty would be adversely affected if HC Realty failed to quality as a REIT.\nHC Realty has elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Its continued qualification as a REIT depends on its satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution and stockholder ownership requirements on a continuing basis. Its ability to satisfy some of the asset tests depends upon the fair market values of its assets, some of which are not able to be precisely determined and for which HC Realty has indicated it will not obtain independent appraisals. If HC Realty fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and certain statutory relief provisions are not available, HC Realty would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and distributions to stockholders would not be deductible by it in computing its taxable income. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution. Unless entitled to relief under certain Internal Revenue Code provisions, HC Realty also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which HC Realty ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if HC Realty fails to qualify as a REIT, HC Realty will no longer be required to make distributions. As a result of all these factors, HC Realty\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT could impair its ability to expand business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our HC Common Stock and HC Series B Stock.\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d could limit the use of our net operating loss carryforwards and our potential to derive a benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards.\nIf an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs pursuant to applicable statutory regulations, we are potentially subject to limitations on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards which in turn could adversely impact our potential to derive a benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards. While we have entered into a rights agreement designed to preserve and protect our net operating loss carryforwards, there is no guarantee that the rights agreement will prevent us from experiencing an ownership change and, therefore, having a limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of our common stock of more than 50% by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d during a three-year test period.\nWe will continue to incur the expense of complying with public company reporting requirements following the closing of the Asset Sale.\nSubsequent to the Asset Sale, we continue to be required to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), even though compliance with such reporting requirements is economically burdensome.\nOur common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) following the Asset Sale, and there may be reduced ability to trade our common stock.\nSubsequent to the Asset Sale, our common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market pursuant to Nasdaq\u2019s authority under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5101. While trading of our common stock is currently conducted in the over-the-counter market on the OTCQB, such trading could substantially reduce the market liquidity of our common stock. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock.\nFailure to successfully identify, acquire and, to the extent applicable, operate non-furniture related assets could cause our stock price to decline.\nFollowing the closing of the Asset Sale, we began evaluating alternatives for using cash proceeds from the Asset Sale to acquire non-furniture related assets. We have not identified any assets for acquisition other than the equity interest we acquired in HC Realty and we may not be able to identify other profitable assets. In addition, any assets that we do acquire, including our equity interest in HC Realty, may not be profitable. If we are not successful in identifying, acquiring and, to the extent applicable, operating non-furniture related assets, our stock price may decline.\nWe will likely have no operating history in the business of non- furniture related assets to be acquired, and therefore, with respect to certain assets, we will be subject to the risks inherent in establishing a new line of business.\nOther than the equity interest we acquired in HC Realty, we have not identified additional assets to be acquired or the line or lines of business to which any such assets may relate and, therefore, cannot fully describe the specific risks presented by an acquisition of such assets. It is likely that we will have had no operating history in the line of business of any such assets to be acquired, and it is possible that any such assets that we may acquire will have a limited operating history in their business. Accordingly, to the extent we acquire any such assets, our future success may in part be subject to the risks, expenses, problems and delays inherent in establishing a new line of business and the ultimate success of such new business cannot be assured. In addition, our management does not have prior experience relating to the operations of a real estate investment trust such as HC Realty and the ultimate success of our investment in HC Realty cannot be assured.\nResources may be expended in researching potential acquisitions that might not be consummated.\nThe investigation of non-furniture company assets to acquire and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements and other documents will require substantial management time and attention in addition to potentially incurring legal and other professional expenses. If a decision is made not to complete a specific acquisition, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2018, we had not incurred any such related expenses. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific acquisition, we may fail to consummate the acquisition for any number of reasons including those beyond our control.\nOwnership may become diluted if we conduct a rights offering.\nOur board is considering a rights offering to raise additional cash for acquisition purposes. If we conduct a rights offering and you do not participate, you will experience dilution in your ownership.\nWe may be required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nUnder Section 3(a)(l)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"1940 Act\"), an issuer is deemed to be an investment company if it is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire \u201cinvestment securities\u201d having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer's total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. The 1940 Act defines \u201cinvestment securities\u201d broadly to include virtually all securities except U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves regulated or exempt investment companies. Consequently, the A&R Note and S&L Note may be considered investment securities and we may fall within the scope of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act.\nA company that falls within the scope of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act can avoid being regulated as an investment company if it can rely on certain of the exclusions under the 1940 Act. One such exclusion is Rule 3a-2 under the 1940 Act, which allows a 3(a)(1)(C) investment company (as a \"transient investment company\") a grace period of one year from the date of classification (in our case, the date of the Asset Sale, which was March 2, 2018) to avoid registration under the 1940 Act, so long as it does not intend to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. While we did not acquire sufficient assets within one year from closing the Asset Sale as contemplated by Rule 3a-2, the Rule is a safe harbor and failure to comply with that Rule does not necessarily indicate a need to register under the 1940 Act.\nWe have actively pursued alternatives for using cash proceeds from the Asset Sale for the acquisition of non-furniture related assets and acquired an equity interest in HC Government Realty Trust, Inc. (\u201cHC Realty\u201d) on March 19, 2019; however, we could become subject to the 1940 Act and be required to register under the 1940 Act. Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulation relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates.\nIf we are required to register under the 1940 Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.\nOur common stock may be deemed a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nOur common stock may be considered a \"penny stock\" as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, unless the price of our shares of common stock is at least $5.00. We expect that our share price will remain less than $5.00. Unless our common stock is otherwise excluded from the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d, the penny stock rules apply. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, the level of trading activity could be limited and it may be difficult for investors to sell our common stock.\nFollowing the closing of the Asset Sale, we became a \u201cshell company\u201d under the federal securities laws.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale, we no longer had an operating business, and accordingly, alter the closing of the Asset Sale, we became a shell company as defined by Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. As a result of our acquisition of an equity interest in HC Realty on March 19, 2019, we are no longer a shell company. However, applicable securities rules prohibit shell companies from using a Form S-8 registration statement to register securities pursuant to employee compensation plans and from utilizing Form S-3 for the registration of securities for 12 months after we cease to be a shell company.\nTo assist the Securities and Exchange Commission in the identification of shell companies, we were required to check a box on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our annual reports on Form 10-K indicating that we were a shell company.\nUnder Rule 144 of the Securities Act, a holder of restricted securities of a company that was a \u201cshell company\u201d is not allowed to resell their securities in reliance upon Rule 144 for a period of 12 months after the company ceases to be a shell company and files required information with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The inability to utilize registration statements on Forms S-8 and S-3 would likely increase our costs to register securities in the future. Additionally, the loss of the use of Rule 144 and Form S-8 might make the offering and sale of our securities to employees, directors and others under compensatory arrangements more expensive and less attractive to recipients.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We identified a material weakness in our internal control during the third quarter of 2018 over the assignment of a portion of the Original Note to S&L. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls related to the accounting with respect to the recording of a gain on extinguishment of the Original Note. If our remediation efforts for this material weakness is not successful, or if other material weaknesses arise in the future, our ability to properly manage the business may be impaired and we may be unable to accurately report our financial results. This could result in previously reported financial results being restated, which could result in a loss of investor confidence and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nOur executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders have significant voting power and may vote their shares in a manner that is not in the best interest of other stockholders.\nOur executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders control approximately 39% of the voting power represented by our outstanding common stock. If these stockholders act together, they may be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs requiring stockholder approval, such as the election of directors or the dissolution of the company. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all our stockholders.\nOur management, who will be employed on a part-time basis for the foreseeable future, currently has outside business interests that will require their time and attention and may interfere with their ability to devote all of their time to our business, which may adversely affect our business and operations.\nSince our business will be limited until we find suitable non-furniture assets for acquisition, our only employees consist of our two executive officers, who will be employed for the foreseeable future on a part-time basis and who have outside business interests that could require substantial time and attention. Our executive officers are associated with Hale Partnership Capital Management LLC and devote significant time to its affairs. Our executive officers are also associated with HC Government Realty Trust, Inc.. On March 19, 2019, we acquired an equity interest in HC Realty and made a loan to HC Realty\u2019s operating partnership. We cannot accurately predict the amount of time and attention that will be required of our officers to perform their ongoing duties related to outside business interests. The inability of our officers to devote sufficient time to managing our business could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.", "PERMNO": 78068, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "STLY"}
