{"cik": "948708", "company": "SMITH MICRO SOFTWARE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur future operating results are highly uncertain. Before deciding to invest in our common stock or to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our other Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nIf we are unable to meet our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months, the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe currently believe that we will be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months, primarily based on our current working capital levels, our current financial projections, and our ability to secure short-term loans and raise capital when necessary.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is substantially dependent upon these factors. If our financial and cash flow position the Company unfavorably compared to our internal plans and projections, we may need to consider additional actions to mitigate conditions or events that would raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, including the following:\n\u2022\nRaising additional capital through short-term loans.\n\u2022\nImplementing additional restructuring and cost reductions.\n\u2022\nRaising additional capital through a private placement or other transaction.\n\u2022\nDisposing of or discontinuing one or more product lines.\n\u2022\nSelling or licensing intellectual property.\nShould our going concern assumption not be appropriate or should we become unable to continue in the normal course of operations, adjustments would be required to our consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, and these adjustments could be significant. Our consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments or reclassifications of assets and liabilities that would be necessary if we were to become unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe may raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money in order to meet our capital needs. Additional funds to allow us to meet our capital needs may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe believe that our cash and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for the next twelve months. However, it is possible that we may need or choose to obtain additional financing to fund our future activities. We could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail our operations or other business activities significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets.\nIt is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently anticipated. The amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nthe levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nour business, product, capital expenditure, and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps;\n\u2022\nthe levels of working capital that we maintain;\n\u2022\ncapital improvements to new and existing facilities;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 response to our products; and\n\u2022\nour relationships with suppliers and customers.\nIn addition, we may raise additional capital to accommodate planned growth, hiring, and infrastructure needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, products or technologies.\nOur current customer profile, including the fact that we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to a concentrated number of clients, may adversely impact our revenues and operating results.\nIn our Wireless business segment, we sell primarily to large carriers, cable operators, and OEMs, so there are a limited number of actual and potential customers for our products, resulting in significant customer\nconcentration. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Sprint and their affiliates comprised 61% of our total revenues.\nBecause of our relatively high customer concentration, this carrier and other large customers possess a relative level of pricing power over us, and any material decrease in sales to any of them would materially affect our revenue and profitability.\nOur carrier, cable operator, and OEM customers are not the end users of our products and our revenue is in many instances dependent upon distribution of our products by our customers to their end users. If any of their efforts to market and sell products and services incorporating our software and services are unsuccessful in the marketplace, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe also derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few vertical markets, such as wireless carriers, cable operators, and handset manufacturers. In order to sustain and grow our business, we must continue to sell our software products in these vertical markets. Shifts in the dynamics of these vertical markets, such as new product introductions by our competitors, could materially harm our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Increasing our sales outside our core vertical markets, for example to large enterprises, requires us to devote time and resources to hire and train sales employees familiar with those industries. Even if we are successful in hiring and training sales teams, customers in other vertical markets may not need or sufficiently value our current products or new product introductions.\nIf there are delays in the distribution of our products or if customer negotiations for our new products cannot occur on a timely basis, we may not be able to generate revenues sufficient to meet the needs of the business in the foreseeable future or at all.\nThe Company has a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future, and may not achieve profitability.\nWe have undertaken recent restructurings to reduce our expenses to be more in line with our current and projected revenue. However, if our revenues do not increase in the future, we will likely need to undertake further restructurings, operating losses will likely continue, and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and could fall below analyst or investor expectations, which could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline. Fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of a key customer;\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of orders from and shipments to our major customers;\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of any product return requests;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain or increase gross margins;\n\u2022\nvariations in our sales channels or the mix of our product sales;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate market needs and to identify, develop, complete, introduce, market and produce new products and technologies in a timely manner to address those needs;\n\u2022\nthe availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products;\n\u2022\nacquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe effect of new and emerging technologies;\n\u2022\nthe timing of acceptance of new mobile services by users of our customers\u2019 services;\n\u2022\ndeferrals of orders by our customers in anticipation of new products, applications, product enhancements or operating systems; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nWe have difficulty predicting the volume and timing of orders. In any given quarter, our sales may involve large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers. As a result, the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of orders could materially impact our revenues, which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance. Also, we have often recorded a large amount of our sales in the last month of the quarter and often in the last week of that month. Accordingly, delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenues to fall substantially short of anticipated levels. Significant sales may also occur earlier than expected, which could cause operating results for later quarters to compare unfavorably with operating results from earlier quarters.\nFuture orders may come from new customers or from existing customers for new products. The sales cycles may be greater than what we have experienced in the past, increasing the difficulty to predict quarterly revenues.\nBecause we sell primarily to large carriers, cable/MSOs and OEM customers, we have no direct relationship with most end users of our products. This indirect relationship delays feedback and blurs signals of change in the quick-to-evolve wireless ecosystem, and is one of the reasons we have difficulty predicting demand.\nA large portion of our operating expenses, including rent, depreciation and amortization, is fixed and difficult to reduce or change. Accordingly, if our total revenue does not meet our expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue. In that event, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this Report, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance.\nTechnology and customer needs change rapidly in our market, which could render our products obsolete and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards. We will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our target markets\u2019 changing demands and keep up with evolving industry standards, including changes in the Microsoft, Google, and Apple operating systems with which our products are designed to be compatible, and to promote those products successfully. The communications and graphics software markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards, and short product life cycles. In addition, some of the technology we market, which has been sold as software in the past, can be integrated at the chipset level by the leading mobile chipset manufacturers. Any of these factors could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. In addition, new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods as a result of the complexities inherent in today\u2019s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers and called for by evolving wireless networking technologies. If our target markets do not develop as we anticipate, our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets, or we are unable to develop new versions of our software products that can operate on future wireless networks and PC and mobile device operating systems and interoperate with other popular applications, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition within our target markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors and new entrants, which could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe operate in markets that are extremely competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. Because there are low barriers to entry into the software markets in which we participate and may participate in the future, we expect significant competition to continue from both established and emerging software companies, both domestic and international. In fact, our growth opportunities in new product markets could be limited to the extent established\nand emerging software companies enter or have entered those markets. Furthermore, our existing and potential OEM customers may acquire or develop products that compete directly with our products.\nMany of our other current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical, and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Announcements of competing products by competitors could result in the cancellation of orders by customers in anticipation of the introduction of such new products. In addition, some of our competitors are currently making complementary products that are sold separately. Such competitors could decide to enhance their competitive position by bundling their products to attract customers seeking integrated, cost-effective software applications. Some competitors have a retail emphasis and offer OEM products with a reduced set of features. The opportunity for retail upgrade sales may induce these and other competitors to make OEM products available at their own cost or even at a loss. We also expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidations, which may lead to the creation of additional large and well-financed competitors. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, and loss of market share.\nWe have introduced products to support higher speed networking and 4G technologies and services and next generation networks. If the market for these products does not develop as we have anticipated or if the adoption of and investments in these technologies and services grows more slowly than we have anticipated, our operating results, financial condition, and prospects may be negatively affected.\nWe have introduced products to support new high-speed networking, 4G technologies, and next generation networks, but the pace of the market adoption of such technologies and the deployment of next generation networks is uncertain. Where some of the products that we have introduced to support high-speed networking and 4G technologies have allowed us to enter new markets, such as mobile marketing and analytics, a viable market for these products may not develop or be sustainable, and we may face intense competition in these markets.\nFuture sales and any future profits from these and related products are substantially dependent upon the acceptance and use of these new high-speed networking and 4G technologies, on the continued adoption and use of mobile data services by end users, on our carrier, MSO, and enterprise customers\u2019 ability to successfully introduce new mobile services enabled by our products, and on our ability to broaden our carrier customer base, which we believe will be difficult and time-consuming. If the adoption of and investments in new networking and 4G technologies does not grow or grows more slowly than anticipated, or if CSPs delay their deployment of next generation networks or fail to deploy such networks successfully, or if we are unable to compete in new markets for our products, we will not obtain the anticipated returns from our planning and development investments. To the extent we devote substantial resources and incur significant expenses to enable our products to be interoperable with new networks that have failed or have been delayed or not deployed, our operating results, financial condition, and prospects may be negatively affected.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management and other key technical personnel. We do not have employment agreements with our key employees. The loss of the services of our key employees would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, particularly highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing research and development required to develop and enhance our products. Competition for these employees remains high and employee retention is a common problem in our industry. Our inability to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are essential to our product development, marketing, service, and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate revenue, develop new products or product enhancements and generally would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely directly and indirectly on third-party intellectual property and licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMany of the Company\u2019s products and services include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties directly to us or to unrelated companies which provide us with sublicenses and/or execution of\nservices for the operation of our business. These products and services include our wireless suite of products, as well as our graphics products. The Company has historically been able to obtain such licenses on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. If the Company or our third-party service providers are unable to obtain or renew critical licenses on reasonable terms, we may be forced to terminate or curtail our products and services which rely on such intellectual property, and our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to continue to establish and maintain strategic relationships with mobile device manufacturers, wireless carriers, cable MSOs and network infrastructure manufacturers, market acceptance of our products and our profitability may suffer.\nMost of our strategic relationships with mobile device manufacturers are not subject to written contract, but rather are in the form of informal working relationships. We believe these relationships are valuable to our success. In particular, these relationships provide us with insights into product development and emerging technologies, which allows us to keep abreast of, or anticipate, market trends, and helps us serve our current and prospective customers. Because these relationships are not typically governed by written agreements, there is no obligation for many of our partners to continue working with us. If we are unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships with mobile device manufacturers or if we fail to enter into additional strategic relationships or the parties with whom we have strategic relationships favor one of our competitors, our ability to provide products that meet our current and prospective customers\u2019 needs could be compromised and our reputation and future revenue prospects could suffer. For example, if our software does not function well with a popular mobile device because we have not maintained a relationship with its manufacturer, carriers seeking to provide that device to their respective customers could choose a competitor\u2019s software over ours or develop their own. Even if we succeed in establishing these relationships, they may not result in additional customers or revenues.\nOur growth depends in part on our customers\u2019 ability and willingness to promote our services and attract and retain new end user customers or achieve other goals outside of our control.\nWe sell our wireless products for use on handheld devices primarily to our carrier, cable/MSO, and enterprise customers, who deploy our products for use by their end user customers. The success of our carrier, cable/MSO and enterprise customers, and their ability and willingness to market services to their end users that are supported by our products, is critical to our future success. Our ability to generate revenues from sales of our software is also constrained by our carrier customers\u2019 ability to attract and retain customers. We have no input into or influence upon their marketing efforts and sales and customer retention activities. If our large carrier customers fail to maintain or grow demand for their services, revenues or revenue growth from our products designed for use on mobile devices will decline and our results of operations will suffer.\nOur acquisitions of companies or technologies may disrupt our business and divert management attention and cause our current operations to suffer.\nWe have historically made targeted acquisitions of smaller companies with important technology and expect to continue to do so in the future. As part of any acquisition, we will be required to assimilate the operations, products, and personnel of the acquired businesses and train, retain, and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts. Similarly, acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management\u2019s attention from our Company\u2019s day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with our current employees, customers, and strategic partners. Acquisitions may also subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition.\nWe may also have to incur debt or issue equity securities in order to finance future acquisitions. Our financial condition could be harmed to the extent we incur substantial debt or use significant amounts of our cash resources in acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our existing stockholders. In addition, we expect our profitability could be adversely affected because of acquisition-related accounting costs, write offs, amortization expenses, and charges related to acquired intangible assets. In consummating acquisitions, we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have had limited or no prior experience. If we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses, products, or technologies within existing operations, we may not receive the intended benefits of such acquisitions.\nOur operating income or loss may continue to change due to shifts in our sales mix and variability in our operating expenses.\nOur operating income or loss can change quarter to quarter and year to year due to a change in our sales mix and the timing of our continued investments in research and development and infrastructure. We continue to invest in research and development, which is the lifeline of our technology portfolio. The timing of these additional expenses can vary significantly quarter to quarter and even from year to year.\nOur products may contain undetected software defects, which could negatively affect our revenues.\nOur software products are complex and may contain undetected defects. In the past, we have discovered software defects in certain of our products and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period it took to correct these problems. Although we and our OEM customers test our products, it is possible that errors may be found or occur in our new or existing products after we have commenced commercial shipment of those products. Defects, whether actual or perceived, could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenues, product returns, a delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position, or claims against us by customers. Any such problems could be costly to remedy and could cause interruptions, delays, or cessation of our product sales, which could cause us to lose existing or prospective customers and could negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, some of our software contains open source components that are licensed under the GNU General Public License and other open source licenses. These components may contain undetected defects or incompatibilities, may cause us to lose control over the development of portions of our software code, and may expose us to claims of infringement if these components are, or incorporate, infringing materials, the licenses are not enforceable or are modified to become incompatible with other open source licenses, or exposure to misappropriation claims if these components include unauthorized materials from a third party.\nRegulations affecting our customers and us and future regulations, to which they or we may become subject to, may harm our business.\nCertain of our customers in the communications industry are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, which could have an indirect effect on our business. In addition, the U.S. telecommunications industry has been subject to continuing deregulation since 1984. We cannot predict when, or upon what terms and conditions, further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect regulation or deregulation may have on demand for our products from customers in the communications industry. Demand for our products may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those products, which may increase our costs and expenses.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, which could negatively impact our revenues.\nOur success is dependent upon our software code base, our programming methodologies and other intellectual properties and proprietary rights. In order to protect our proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, patents, and copyright and trademark law. We currently own U.S. trademark registrations for certain of our trademarks and U.S. patents for certain of our technologies. However, these measures afford us only limited protection. Furthermore, we rely primarily on \u201cshrink wrap\u201d licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Accordingly, it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain our rights without our authorization. It is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours. It may be difficult for us to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nWe may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of trademarks, patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights asserted by companies in our industry grows and the coverage of these patents and other rights and the functionality of software products increasingly overlap. From time to time, we have received communications from third parties asserting that our trade name or features, content, or trademarks of certain of our products infringe upon intellectual property rights held by such third parties. We have also received correspondence from third parties separately asserting that our products may infringe on certain patents held by each of the parties. Although we are not aware that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others, third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to our current or future products. Additionally, our customer agreements require that we indemnify our customers for infringement claims made by third parties involving our intellectual property embedded in their products. Infringement claims, whether with or without merit, could result in time-consuming and costly litigation, divert the attention of our management, cause product shipment delays, or\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties. If we are required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, they may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. Unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements could seriously impair our ability to market our products.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal, business, and economic risks specific to international operations.\nIn recent years, our revenues derived from sales to customers outside the U.S. have not been material. Our revenues derived from such sales can vary from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We also frequently ship products to our domestic customers\u2019 international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors. In the future, we may expand these international business activities. International operations are subject to many inherent risks, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral political, social and economic instability;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of governmental controls;\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal standards, particularly with respect to intellectual property;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including without limitation data privacy laws, such as the General Data Privacy Regulation in Europe;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements and restrictions of the United States and any other country in which we operate;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nforeign technical standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in securing and servicing international customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and any imposition of currency exchange controls; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nThese conditions may increase our cost of doing business. Moreover, as our customers are adversely affected by these conditions, our business with them may be disrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may harm our business.\nThe uninterrupted operation of our hosted solutions and the confidentiality and security of third-party information is critical to our business. Any failures in our security and privacy measures, such as \u201chacking\u201d of our systems by outsiders, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. If we are unable to protect, or our customers perceive that we are unable to protect, the security and privacy of our electronic information, our growth could be materially adversely affected. A security or privacy breach may:\n\u2022\ncause our customers to lose confidence in our solutions;\n\u2022\nharm our reputation;\n\u2022\nexpose us to liability; and\n\u2022\nincrease our expense from potential remediation costs.\nWhile we believe we use proven applications designed for data security and integrity to process electronic transactions, there can be no assurance that our use of these applications will be sufficient to address changing market conditions or the security and privacy concerns of existing and potential customers. In addition, our customers and end users may use our products and services in a manner which violates security or data privacy laws\nin one or more jurisdictions. Any significant or high profile data privacy breaches or violations of data privacy laws, whether directly through our hosted solutions or by third parties using our products and services, could result in the loss of business and reputation, litigation against us and regulatory investigations and penalties that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nInterruptions or delays in service from data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our customers from data center hosting facilities. Any damage to, or failure of, such facilities generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their on-demand services, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market, our common stock would likely be delisted from trading on NASDAQ, which would likely reduce the liquidity of our common stock and could cause our trading price to decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Stock Market. We are required to meet specified financial requirements in order to maintain our listing on NASDAQ. If we fail to satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ and our common stock would instead trade on the OTC Market. Any potential delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility of our common stock, and would likely cause our trading price to decline.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as sales, use, and other non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, sales and use taxes, and other tax liabilities. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate.\nWe are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. An increasing number of states have considered or have adopted laws that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state retailers to collect sales and use taxes on their behalf. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect sales and use taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nAlthough we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that our provisions for taxes are correct, or that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If we are required to pay substantially more taxes in the future or for prior periods, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEvolving information security and data privacy laws and regulations may result in increased compliance costs, impediments to the development or performance of our offerings, and monetary or other penalties.\nBecause our solutions process customer data that may contain personally identifying information, we are or may become subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the privacy and protection of such data. These laws and regulations address a range of issues, including data privacy, cybersecurity and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, retention or transfer of data. The regulatory framework for data privacy and cybersecurity issues worldwide can vary substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. In the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), is due to come into force in May 2018. The GDPR will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR will include operational and governance requirements for companies that collect or process personal data of residents of the European Union that differ from or expand upon those currently in place in the EU. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. The costs of compliance with, and\nother burdens imposed by, these laws and regulations may become substantial and may limit the use and adoption of our offerings, require us to change our business practices, impede the performance and development of our solutions, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance with such laws or regulations.", "PERMNO": 82281, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SMSI"}
