{"cik": "1065059", "company": "CENTRUS ENERGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risk factors below, in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nThe full extent to which our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy will impact our business operations, reputation and relationships with our customers, employees, suppliers and regulators are uncertain.\nCentrus recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our recent emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, employees and suppliers, as well as with the federal government, upon which plans for the American Centrifuge project are dependent. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nkey suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022\ntrade creditors could require payment in advance or cash on delivery;\n\u2022\nthe ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, as our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted;\n\u2022\nthe operations and relationships of our wholly owned subsidiary Enrichment Corp., even though not included as a debtor in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, may suffer; and\n\u2022\nother factors as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations going forward.\nOur financial results after emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy are not comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh start accounting. Adoption of fresh start accounting and modification of our accounting policies relating to pension and postretirement benefits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 may have a significant effect on our financial condition and future results of operations.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 852. Our consolidated financial statements also reflect all of the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are not comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in the Company\u2019s historical financial statements. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our Class A Common Stock.\nAs part of the adoption of fresh start accounting upon our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, fair value adjustments for the Company were made that:\n\u2022\nsignificantly reduce the gross profit impact of deferred revenues going forward;\n\u2022\nresult in the amortization of sales backlog and customer relationship intangible assets that were created at emergence; and\n\u2022\nresult in higher cost of sales as a result of increasing inventory values at emergence.\nThe reduction of the gross profit impact of deferred revenues going forward, the amortization of sales backlog and customer relationship intangible assets that were created at emergence, and the higher cost of sales as a result of increasing inventory values at emergence will adversely impact our results of operations in future periods.\nIn addition, we will evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets by performing impairment tests whenever adverse conditions or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment loss. If impairment is indicated, the asset carrying value will be reduced to fair market value or, if fair market value is not readily available, the asset is reduced to a value determined by applying a discount rate to expected cash flows. Additionally, the carrying value of the excess reorganization value will be evaluated by performing an impairment test on an annual basis. The excess reorganization value testing utilizes a two-step process, where the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to its fair value. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. However, if the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the second step is performed. An impairment charge would be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of the excess reorganization value exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the net present value of projected future cash flows. In the event any of these evaluations result in an impairment, the impairment will adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAssets and obligations related to our retiree benefit plans are remeasured each year as of the balance sheet date resulting in differences between actual and projected results for the year. Historically, we recognized these actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity and generally amortized them into operating results over the average future service period of the active employees of these plans or the average future lifetime of plan participants for inactive plans. Upon the adoption of fresh start accounting and as a result of ceasing enrichment activities and the various plan changes, we adopted an accounting policy to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in the statement of operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014. The immediate recognition in the statement of operations is intended to increase transparency into how movements in plan assets and benefit obligations impact financial results. Immediate recognition of such actuarial gains and losses in the statement of operations may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations.\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, our Old Notes and Old Common Stock were cancelled and we issued New Notes and Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Our New Notes are not listed on any national or regional securities exchange. Shares of our Class A Common Stock are listed on the NYSE MKT.\nIn the short period since the issuance of our Class A Common Stock, the price of our Class A Common Stock has been volatile and remains subject to volatility and the current market price of our Class A Common Stock may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the future. The market price of our Class A Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our Class A Common Stock may be affected by, numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our new capital structure as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization, our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our Class A Common Stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results. The automatic conversion (with limited exceptions) of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock upon the sale of Class B Common Stock could significantly adversely impact the trading price of the Class A Common Stock on the NYSE MKT.\nThe New Notes represent a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The New Notes are not listed on any securities exchange. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for the New Notes or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the New Notes. The New Notes may be traded only infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or otherwise, and reliable market quotations for the New Notes may not be available. In addition, the trading prices of the New Notes will depend on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the limited trading volume of the New Notes and the other factors discussed above with respect to the Class A Common Stock.\nCentrus has significant long-term liabilities.\nWhile the restructuring under the Plan of Reorganization significantly reduced the amount of and extended the maturity of our debt, we emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy with significant long-term liabilities. In addition to the indebtedness under the New Notes, we still have substantial pension and postretirement health and life benefit obligations and other long-term liabilities. In addition, the terms of the Indenture will not restrict Centrus, or any of its subsidiaries (including Enrichment Corp.), from incurring substantial additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur significant long-term liabilities (and other third-party financial obligations) could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to lenders and other creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness or breaches of such other commitments;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and have less flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in the nuclear enrichment industry which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any industry competitors that have less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022\nwe may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing for future working capital, further development of the American Centrifuge project and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nwe will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash resources to payments on the New Notes thereby reducing the availability of our cash for further development of the American Centrifuge project and to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\nIf we incur substantial additional indebtedness, the foregoing risks would intensify. Additional information concerning the New Notes including the terms and conditions of the New Notes are described in Note 13, Debt, of the consolidated financial statements.\nFollowing our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the composition of the Board of Directors changed significantly and the Board of Directors\u2019 ability to quickly learn our business and lead our Company will be critical to our success.\nPursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the composition of the Board of Directors changed significantly. Six of the ten current directors have not previously served on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. Although there will be certain regulatory, contractual or other constraints on the actions of the new Board, there is no certainty that the new Board will continue to pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our current strategic plans with respect to the American Centrifuge project or any other matter. Moreover, the new Board may elect to make changes in the current management team which could impact the direction and management of the Company.\nThe ability of the new directors to quickly expand their knowledge of our business plans, operations and strategies and our technologies and to obtain security clearances in a timely manner will be critical to their ability to make informed decisions about Company strategy and operations. If our Board of Directors is not sufficiently informed to make such decisions, our ability to compete effectively and profitably could be adversely affected.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nThe success of our business depends on key executives, managers, scientists, engineers and other skilled personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. We do not have employment agreements with our corporate executives or other key personnel, nor do we have key man life insurance policies. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity. In addition, most of the key personnel are involved in the development of the American Centrifuge technology and all of them have security clearances. The loss of these key personnel could result in delays in the deployment of the American Centrifuge project. Given the proprietary nature of centrifuge technology, we are also at risk as to its intellectual property if key employees resign to work for a competitor.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Condition\nThe continued effects on the industry of the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nApproximately 60 reactors in Japan and Germany were taken off-line and remain out of service in the regulatory and political aftermath following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused irreparable damage to four reactors in Fukushima, Japan. In recent months, the Japanese government process for evaluating the restart of nuclear reactors took important steps forward. Japanese utilities have requested permission to restart a total of 20 reactors. Four reactors have completed the safety review under the new nuclear safety standards established by Japan's Nuclear Regulatory Authority. One or more of these reactors is expected to restart in 2015. Germany has shut down eight of its reactors and announced that it will be phasing out all 17 nuclear reactors by 2022. Although we do not serve any of the German reactors, the shutdown of any reactor contributes to the excess supply in the market.\nThe events at Fukushima and its aftermath have negatively affected the balance of supply and demand. This impact could continue to grow depending on the length and severity of delays or cancellations of deliveries. Prior to the events in Japan, Japanese demand was approximately 6 million SWU annually. The longer that this demand is reduced or absent from the market, the greater the cumulative impact on the market. Market prices for our products are at their lowest levels in more than a decade and this trend could continue or worsen. Suppliers whose deliveries are cancelled or delayed due to shutdown reactors or delays in reactor refuelings have excess supply available to sell in the market. This has adversely affected our success in selling LEU. Decreases in SWU prices have also adversely affected our ability to finance and deploy the ACP. The events have created significant uncertainty and our business, cash flow, results of operations and prospects have been and in the future could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have long been a leading supplier of LEU to Japan and TEPCO, owner of the Fukushima plant, has historically been one of our largest customers. Sales to Japanese utility customers in 2014 were $89.2 million. A portion of these contracts are requirements contracts and therefore sales to Japanese utility customers with such contracts could be delayed or ultimately canceled depending on how quickly their reactors return to service. If deliveries under contracts included in our backlog are significantly delayed, modified or canceled, because purchases are tied to requirements or because customers seek to limit their obligations under existing contracts, our\nrevenues and earnings may be materially and adversely impacted, with a corresponding impact on our financial condition and prospects.\nThe effects of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and other market conditions, have impacted our ability to finance and deploy the ACP, including obtaining financing in the timeframe needed and the overall economics of the project. Funding following the ACTDO Agreement, as well as the economics, financing and timing of commercial deployment, are uncertain. Our ability to finance the project could also be further adversely impacted by the potential extended duration of the current supply/demand imbalance in the market for LEU. In addition, while we have discussed with Japanese export credit agencies financing up to $1 billion of the cost of constructing the ACP, the availability of such potential funding could be adversely affected by the impacts of the events in Japan and the delay in commercial deployment. There is no assurance that the Japanese export credit agencies will not shift their priorities in the future or otherwise be unable to provide financing in the amount needed. If our ability to obtain Japanese export credit agency financing was adversely affected, this would also adversely affect the ability to obtain a DOE loan guarantee and construct the ACP.\nThe March 2011 events in Japan could also have a material and adverse impact on the nuclear energy industry in the long term. The impact of the events have harmed the public\u2019s perception of nuclear power and have raised public opposition to the planned future construction of nuclear plants. Some countries have delayed or abandoned deployment of nuclear power as a result of the events in Japan. Italy has renewed its moratorium on nuclear power and other European Union countries are reviewing their future plans for nuclear power. Countries have undertaken new safety evaluations of their plants and how well they operate in situations involving earthquakes and other natural disasters and other situations involving the loss of power. Several investment banks have exited uranium trading and spot demand has declined. The uranium market continues to be oversupplied and prices remain under downward pressure because of the continued delay of reactor restarts in Japan. Demand for nuclear fuel has been and in the future could be negatively affected by such actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects.\nIncreased public opposition to nuclear power could lead to political opposition and could slow the pace of global licensing and construction of new or planned nuclear power facilities or negatively impact existing facilities\u2019 efforts to extend their operating licenses. The events could also result in additional permitting requirements and burdensome regulations that increase costs or have other negative impacts and could raise concerns regarding potential risks associated with certain reactor designs or nuclear power production. Since the events at Fukushima, the staff of the NRC has issued requirements for design-basis enhancements to improve U.S. nuclear safety. This could adversely affect the economic viability of the facilities of our customers. The events in Japan have also raised concerns regarding how to deal with spent fuel, which could result in additional burdensome regulations or costs to the nuclear industry which could potentially impact demand for LEU. These events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nThe cessation of enrichment at the Paducah GDP could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nWe ceased enrichment at the Paducah GDP at the end of May 2013. On October 21, 2014, we completed the de-lease and return of the leased facilities at the Paducah GDP to DOE.\nThe Company has moved the uranium inventories previously held at the Paducah GDP to other licensed commercial nuclear facilities. We expect to manage this inventory under agreements with the operators of the facilities and will depend on these operators to provide essential services to the Company, including receiving, managing, protecting, and delivering these inventories as needed, and in some cases, transferring inventories into cylinders that are suitable for transportation and delivery to other processors. All services are provided at our cost and we are dependent upon the performance of these services in a timely manner. In addition, we may need to bear the cost and risk of further transportation of all or part of the inventory from these facilities to other facilities where it can be made available in the future to customers to whom we are obligated to supply the material. These costs and risks are different and potentially greater than the past costs and risks associated with inventory management at the Paducah GDP.\nThe cessation of enrichment at the Paducah GDP could also have significant impacts on our existing business, including:\n\u2022\nThere will be a transition period of at least several years until Centrus will have further clarity regarding its commercialization plans for the ACP. During this period, the Company will be making sales from its existing inventory and supply purchases. The Company has an objective of minimizing the period of transition until it has a new source of domestic U.S. enrichment production. However, there is currently no definitive timeline for the ACP deployment to provide this source of production and the economics of the American Centrifuge project are severely challenged as a result of current nuclear fuel market conditions. Absent a definitive timeline for deployment of the ACP, efforts to pursue the American Centrifuge project and our long-term LEU business could be adversely affected by this lack of certainty in timing and could threaten our overall viability.\n\u2022\nThe cessation of enrichment at the Paducah GDP could adversely affect our relationships with a variety of stakeholders, including customers. Customers could ask us to provide adequate assurances of performance under existing contracts that could adversely affect our business. Customers may also not be willing to modify existing contracts, some of which may need to be revised to permit acceptance of LEU from anticipated supply sources during the transition period. The cessation of enrichment at the Paducah GDP could also adversely affect our ability to enter into new contracts with customers, including our ability to contract for the output of the ACP and for the material purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement.\nAll of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, and correspondingly on our ability to achieve our strategic initiatives.\nWe are dependent on existing inventory, purchases of Russian LEU and purchases from other suppliers to meet our obligations to customers.\nWith the cessation of enrichment at the Paducah GDP, we are now dependent on existing inventory, purchases of Russian LEU and purchases from other suppliers to meet our obligations to customers. We are acquiring alternative sources of supply in the market given the current oversupply. The availability, cost and terms of additional alternative sources of supply are subject to variables that are difficult to predict. A significant delay in, or stoppage or termination of, deliveries of LEU from Russia under the Russian Supply Agreement could adversely affect our ability to make deliveries to customers and would adversely affect revenues and results of operations. A delay, stoppage or termination could occur due to a number of factors, including logistical problems with shipments, commercial or political disputes between the parties or their governments, imposition of sanctions in response to geopolitical events or a failure or inability by either party to meet the terms of such agreements. An interruption of deliveries under the Russian Supply Agreement could adversely impact our results of operations, business and prospects.\nWe may be unable to sell all of the commercial Russian LEU that is purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement for prices that cover our purchase costs, which could adversely affect profitability and the viability of our business; restrictions on imports or sales of Russian LEU could adversely affect the ability to sell commercial Russian LEU purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the Russian Supply Agreement because of current market prices for LEU and restrictions on U.S. imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation. The price we are charged for the SWU component of Russian LEU under the Russian Supply Agreement is determined by a formula that combines a mix of price points and other pricing elements. A multi-year retrospective view of market-based price points in the formula is used to minimize the disruptive effect of short-term swings in these price points, but may result in prices that are not aligned with the prevailing market prices when those prices are depressed, as is currently the case. Currently, the price we pay for Russian LEU is above market prices. Further, there are floor prices applicable to the calculation of the price for such SWU. The agreement provides for reexamination of a key element of the pricing formula in later years to account for significant increases or decreases in market prices. We expect this will result in a reduction in the price we would pay in those years, but\nthere can be no assurance that an unexpected change involving significant market price increases in the next several years will not occur that could lead to a different result. These factors may limit our ability to make new sales at prices that exceed the purchase price we pay for the Russian LEU. While the prices included in existing sales contracts in our backlog currently exceed the price we pay for Russian LEU, our ability to place Russian LEU into backlog contracts is subject to U.S. import limitations and, in some cases, the contracts\u2019 terms.\nAs stated previously, the Russian Supply Agreement provides for the supply by TENEX of commercial Russian LEU to the Company over a ten-year period with deliveries beginning in 2013. Sales of Russian LEU are more challenging than sales of non-Russian material. Some of our customers are unable or unwilling to accept Russian LEU. In addition, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the Russian Supply Agreement because of restrictions on U.S. imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation. These imports (other than LEU we previously imported under the Russian Contract under the Megatons to Megawatts program) are subject to quotas imposed under legislation enacted into law in September 2008 and under the 1992 Russian Suspension Agreement, as amended. Under the Russian Supply Agreement, we have the right to use a portion of the import quotas to support sales in the United States of SWU purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement beginning in 2014, and can ask TENEX for additional quota, which they can give us in their discretion. Prior to the expiration of the quotas at the end of 2020, we will not be able to import for consumption in the United States LEU delivered to us under the Russian Supply Agreement in excess of the portion of the quotas available to us, except for imports that are expressly excluded from the quotas (e.g., LEU for use in fabricating initial fuel cores for any U.S. nuclear reactors entering service for the first time). We expect to procure LEU from other sources or take other actions to service our customers that we are unable to supply from LEU purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement.\nFurther, the Russian LEU that we cannot sell for consumption in the United States will have to be sold for consumption by utilities outside the United States, but the ability to sell to those utilities may be limited by policies of foreign governments or regional institutions that seek to restrict the amount of Russian LEU purchased by utilities under their jurisdiction, as well as requirements that Russian LEU imported into the United States to be used to fabricate fuel for foreign customers must be processed and re-exported within a certain period of time. To facilitate the ability of our Japanese customers to take Russian LEU pending the restart of their reactors, the U.S. Department of Commerce has agreed that so long as our existing Japanese customers hold imported Russian LEU from us in physical storage, they are not required to re-export the material under these time limits until it is withdrawn from storage, but the fact that the time limits on re-export will apply once the material is withdrawn may create uncertainty for Japanese utilities contemplating the use of such storage. As a result, they may resist taking Russian LEU from us. Further, geopolitical events such as the developments in Ukraine, including domestic or international reactions or responses to such events and subsequent government or international actions including the imposition of sanctions, could also impact our ability to purchase, sell or make deliveries of LEU from Russia to customers. An interruption of deliveries under the Russian Supply Agreement could, depending on the length of such an interruption, threaten our ability to fulfill these delivery commitments with adverse effects on our reputation, costs, results of operations, cash flows and long-term viability. In the event of an interruption of deliveries under the Russian Supply Agreement, we would take action to mitigate any adverse impacts on our customers and to fulfill our delivery commitments including delivery from existing inventory and the purchase of alternative supplies. Even in the absence of sanctions or other legal restrictions, customers may be unwilling to agree to purchase or amend contracts to permit delivery of the Russian LEU. Accordingly, while we expect to secure supplies of non-Russian LEU in the currently oversupplied market in order to meet our contract obligations, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to sell Russian LEU in or outside of the United States.\nWe have worked with and expect to continue to work with TENEX to adjust the terms, including quantities, under the Russian Supply Agreement to better align our purchase obligations in light of market conditions generally, our contract backlog, and restrictions on the sale of Russian LEU. We have no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to make adjustments to the Russian Supply Agreement in the future.\nThe long-term success of our LEU business depends on our ability to deploy competitive gas centrifuge enrichment technology.\nWe ceased enrichment at the Paducah GDP at the end of May 2013. The economics, timing and ability of Centrus to commercialize an advanced uranium enrichment centrifuge technology as a replacement for the Paducah GDP are uncertain. Moreover, the construction and deployment of the ACP is a large and capital-intensive undertaking that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully finance and deploy the ACP or an alternative enrichment technology on a cost-effective basis due to the risks and uncertainties described herein or for any other reasons, the long term viability of our LEU business would be threatened.\nCurrent nuclear fuel market conditions are severely challenging the economics of the American Centrifuge project and our ability to finance and proceed with commercialization of the project.\nOur plan and timing for proceeding with the financing and commercialization of the American Centrifuge project are uncertain. Factors that can affect this plan and the economics of the project include key variables related to project cost, schedule, the status of the supply chain for centrifuge manufacturing and plant support systems, market demand and market prices for LEU, financing costs and other financing terms. An oversupply of nuclear fuel available for sale has increased over time as approximately 60 reactors in Japan and Germany have been taken off-line in the aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami that caused irreparable damage to four reactors in Japan. The economics of the project are severely challenged by the current supply/demand imbalance in the market for LEU and related downward pressure on market prices for SWU which are now at their lowest levels in more than a decade. Under current market conditions, we do not believe that our prior plans for commercialization of the American Centrifuge project are economically viable without additional government support beyond the $2 billion loan guarantee funding that we applied for from DOE. In addition, low prices for competing fuels such as natural gas and subsidized renewables in the United States could slow the deployment of new base load nuclear power capacity and have resulted in early retirement of five nuclear plants in the United States over the past two years. Based on current market conditions, we see limited uncommitted demand for LEU relative to supply prior to the end of the decade, which could continue to adversely affect market prices. If there is further delay or reduction in the number of Japanese reactor restarts, the supply/demand imbalance and market prices could worsen. We have also experienced construction cost pressures, including inflation, due to delays in deployment of the project that are impacting the project economics. In addition, actions the Company has taken as part of the limited demobilization due to the reduction in scope of work from the Cooperative Agreement to the ACTDO Agreement or any future demobilization may also adversely impact project economics including as a result of the time and cost associated with project remobilization.\nUncertainties and risks related to implementation of the ACTDO Agreement and American Centrifuge costs that are outside the scope of work under the ACTDO Agreement could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe ACTDO Agreement is a firm fixed-price contract that provides for continued cascade operations and the continuation of core American Centrifuge research and technology activities and the furnishing of related reports to ORNL. On January 23, 2015, ORNL exercised its second option to extend the period of performance for the ACTDO Agreement by an additional six months to September 30, 2015, which increased the total amount of the contract from approximately $75.3 million to approximately $117 million. The agreement is incrementally funded and provides for payments of approximately $6.9 million per month through September 30, 2015. We could incur cost overruns if the costs we incur for the work required to be performed under the ACTDO Agreement exceed the firm fixed funding provided thereunder. Such cost overruns or increases in costs for American Centrifuge activities that are outside the scope of work under the ACTDO Agreement could adversely impact our results of operations.\nFunding for the ACTDO agreement has been appropriated for government fiscal year 2015. ORNL has provided funding incrementally under the ACTDO Agreement on a monthly basis, and funds currently allotted to the ACTDO Agreement are expected to cover the work to be performed through April 30, 2015.\nUncertainties and risks related to future government support and funding for the American Centrifuge program following the current contract with ORNL and related to our continued role in a government program could adversely impact our ability to commercially deploy the American Centrifuge technology and our business.\nDOE instructed UT-Battelle, the management and operating contractor for ORNL, to assist in developing a path forward for achieving a reliable and economic domestic uranium enrichment capability that promotes private sector deployment and that supports national security purposes. This task includes, among other goals: (1) taking actions intended to promote the continued operability of the advanced enrichment centrifuge machines and related property, equipment and technology currently utilized in the American Centrifuge project; and (2) assessing technical options for meeting DOE\u2019s national security needs and preserving the option of commercial deployment. Pursuant to those instructions, ORNL and Centrus entered into the ACTDO Agreement. However, the scope of and our role in a program after completion of the current ACTDO Agreement with ORNL are uncertain, and we have no assurance that the U.S. government will continue to support the project beyond the current subcontract or beyond the current funding available for that subcontract.\nThe Administration\u2019s budget request for government fiscal year 2016 includes $100 million for domestic uranium enrichment to maintain the current centrifuge program while the Administration finalizes its assessment of how best to meet U.S. national security and non-proliferation goals. Appropriations for government fiscal year 2016 will require further action from both Congress and the President. Further, there is no assurance regarding what option, if any, DOE will pursue to maintain a domestic enrichment capability, regarding the timing of a DOE decision, or as to the scope, schedule, cost and funding of such option and whether Congress will support and fund such option. Despite the technical progress that has been made to confirm the technical readiness of the American Centrifuge technology for deployment, if additional funding is not in place to continue the American Centrifuge project, if Enrichment Corp. discontinues its funding of the Company, if DOE determines not to continue the program or our role in the program is discontinued, or if we determine there is no longer a viable path to commercialization of the American Centrifuge project, we could further demobilize or terminate the project. See the Risk Factor, Centrus could further demobilize or terminate the American Centrifuge project in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, business and prospects and could trigger termination of the limited, conditional guaranty by Enrichment Corp. of the New Notes.\nThe Company has material unfunded defined benefit pension plans obligations and postretirement health and life benefit obligations. These liabilities are anticipated to require material contributions in future periods, which may divert funds from other uses and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nCentrus and Enrichment Corp. maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans that are guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\"PBGC\"), a wholly owned U.S. government corporation that was created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). Centrus also maintains non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for certain executive officers. In addition, Enrichment Corp. maintains postretirement health and life benefit plans. These plans are anticipated to require material cash contributions in the future, which may divert funds from other uses and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s liquidity depending on the timing of any required contributions or payments in relation to the Company\u2019s sources of cash and other payment obligations. See also the Risk Factor, Levels of returns on pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the amounts to be contributed to fund future pension and postretirement benefit liabilities could adversely affect earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nIn addition the Company has been in discussion with the PBGC and its advisors regarding the status of the qualified pension plans, including with respect to potential liability under ERISA Section 4062(e). On September 30, 2011, Enrichment Corp. completed the de-lease to the DOE of the former Portsmouth GDP and transition of employees performing government services work to DOE\u2019s decontamination and decommissioning contractor. Enrichment Corp. notified the PBGC of this occurrence at that time.\nFurther, at the end of May 2013, Enrichment Corp. ceased enrichment at the Paducah GDP and on October 21, 2014 completed the de-lease and return of the Paducah GDP to DOE. In connection with the de-lease and return of the Paducah GDP to DOE, the remaining employees at the Paducah GDP were terminated other than a few employees that have been retained to continue operations related to servicing customers, implementation of the Russian contract and to fill positions elsewhere in the Company.\nAfter receiving the Company\u2019s notification of the transition of employees at the Portsmouth GDP in 2011, the PBGC staff at that time informally advised Enrichment Corp. of its preliminary view that the Portsmouth GDP transition was a cessation of operations that triggered liability under ERISA Section 4062(e) and that its preliminary estimate was that the ERISA Section 4062(e) liability (computed taking into account the plan\u2019s underfunding on a \u201ctermination basis,\u201d which amount differs from that computed for GAAP purposes) for the Portsmouth GDP transition was approximately $130 million. At that time, Enrichment Corp. informed the PBGC that it did not agree with the PBGC staff\u2019s view that ERISA Section 4062(e) liability was triggered in 2011, and also disputed the amount of the preliminary PBGC calculation of the potential ERISA Section 4062(e) liability. At the end of May 2013, the PBGC staff also informally advised Enrichment Corp. that the Paducah de-lease would be a cessation of operations under section 4062(e) when more than 20% of the Enrichment Corp.\u2019s employees who are participants in a PBGC-covered pension plan were separated. The 20% reduction to the active plan participant threshold was reached at Paducah in April 2014.\nSubsequently, on December 16, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (the \u201cCFCAA\u201d), which made major changes to ERISA section 4062(e). The CFCAA changes the criteria for triggering liability under section 4062(e); provides certain exemptions from the applicability of section 4062(e) to certain events; permits companies to satisfy the liability by making payments into the pension over seven years, but cease once the pension reaches a 90% funding level as calculated under the method provided in the CFCAA; subject to an exception not applicable here, prohibits the PBGC from taking any enforcement, administrative or other action under section 4062(e) that is inconsistent with the amendments made by the CFCAA based on events that occurred before the date of enactment (December 16, 2014); and permits companies to elect to satisfy any liability under section 4062(e) as provided in the CFCAA for an event that had occurred prior to date of enactment as if such cessation had occurred on such date of enactment. While the PBGC has not issued any guidance or rules regarding the implementation of the changes to section 4062(e), we believe that in the event the PBGC were to determine that a cessation of operations had occurred under section 4062(e) as a result of the Portsmouth GDP transition or the Paducah GDP transition (events that occurred before enactment of the CFCAA), the Company could elect to satisfy any section 4062(e) liability under the provisions of the CFCAA. As of January 1, 2014, (the first plan year for which payments would otherwise be required) the Enrichment Corp. pension plan was over 90% funded under the method used in the CFCAA. Consequently the Company believes that any such liability would be fully satisfied under the method provided in the CFCAA.\nThe PBGC, however, has other authorities under ERISA that it may consider to address the Portsmouth and Paducah transitions or otherwise in connection with the Company\u2019s qualified defined benefit pension plans. These authorities include, but are not limited to, initiating involuntary termination of underfunded plans and seeking liens or additional funding. We would seek to defend against the assertion by the PBGC of any such authorities based on the facts and circumstances at the time. The involuntary termination by the PBGC of any of the qualified pension plans of Centrus or Enrichment Corp. would result in the termination of the limited, conditional guaranty by Enrichment Corp. of the New Notes (other than with respect to the unconditional interest claim).\nWe have been engaged in discussions with the PBGC since the Portsmouth GDP transition. In 2014, prior to enactment of the CFCAA, the PBGC informed the Company that the PBGC had retained an outside financial advisor to advise the PBGC on the Company\u2019s business and the need for and advisability of any actions that may be taken by the PBGC. The Company believes it is in the best interest of all stakeholders, including the PBGC, the covered plan participants and the Company, to continue funding of the qualified pension plans in the ordinary course and expects to do so, but there is no assurance that the PBGC will agree with that approach. In the event that the PBGC initiates involuntary termination actions or seeks liens or additional funding related to such plans, in light of current demands on our liquidity and depending on the timing and amount of any obligations that may arise from such PBGC actions, we might not have the cash needed to address such actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and prospects.\nIn addition, in the event of lack of funding for the American Centrifuge project or lack of prospects for successful financing and commercialization of the American Centrifuge Plant after the completion of the ACTDO Agreement (including under any options, extensions or successor agreements thereto), the Company could demobilize all or a portion of the American Centrifuge project. The PBGC could take the position that a future decision to demobilize the American Centrifuge project, either alone or taken together with the transition of the Portsmouth GDP and Paducah GDP, could create additional potential liabilities under ERISA Section 4062(e) or other provisions under ERISA with respect to either the Enrichment Corp. or the Centrus pension plans, the amount of which would depend on the various factors described above.\nCentrus could further demobilize or terminate the American Centrifuge project in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, business and prospects and could trigger termination of the limited, conditional guaranty by Enrichment Corp. of the New Notes.\nActions Centrus may take with respect to the American Centrifuge project could have significant adverse consequences on its business. Any further demobilization or the termination of the American Centrifuge project could raise doubt about Centrus\u2019 long-term viability and could result in actions by third parties that could give rise to events that individually, or in the aggregate, impose significant demands on its liquidity. For example, in light of a further demobilization or termination of the American Centrifuge project, either alone or taken together with prior actions related to the transition of the Paducah GDP to DOE, the PBGC could determine to utilize authorities under ERISA that could create, increase or accelerate liabilities under ERISA. Any additional demobilization or the termination of the American Centrifuge project could also result in actions by vendors, customers, creditors and other third parties in response to Centrus\u2019 actions or based on their view of its financial strength and future business prospects. In addition, Centrus could incur significant costs in connection with any additional demobilization or termination of the American Centrifuge project that could put significant demands on its liquidity. Centrus currently estimates that it could incur total employee related severance and benefit costs of approximately $13 million for all American Centrifuge workers in the event of a full demobilization of the project. Depending on the length of the demobilization period, Centrus would also incur significant costs related to the execution of the demobilization in addition to the costs described above. Our actual costs could be greater than these estimates. Continued funding to Centrus from Enrichment Corp. would also be in doubt in this scenario. Such actions may have a material adverse impact on Centrus\u2019 ability to deploy the American Centrifuge technology, on Centrus\u2019 results of operations and liquidity, and on the long-term viability of the LEU business.\nTermination of the American Centrifuge project could trigger termination of the limited, conditional guaranty by Enrichment Corp. of the New Notes (other than with respect to the unconditional interest claim).\nActions Centrus has taken or may take in the future to reduce spending on the American Centrifuge project may have adverse consequences on the American Centrifuge project.\nAs a result of the reduction in DOE funding and scope of work for the American Centrifuge project under the ACTDO Agreement as compared to the scope of work under the prior Cooperative Agreement, Centrus undertook a limited demobilization of certain American Centrifuge project activities. This limited demobilization has and any further reductions in spending on the American Centrifuge project would:\n\u2022\ncause Centrus to implement worker layoffs and potentially lose additional key skilled personnel, all of whom have security clearances, which could be difficult to re-hire or replace, and incur severance and other termination costs;\n\u2022\ncause Centrus to need to suspend or to terminate contracts with suppliers and contractors involved in the American Centrifuge project and make it more difficult to obtain key suppliers for the ACP and preserve the manufacturing infrastructure developed over the last several years; and\n\u2022\ndelay deployment of the American Centrifuge project and increase its overall cost, which could adversely affect the overall economics of the project and Centrus\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize the American Centrifuge technology.\nSuch actions may have a material adverse impact on Centrus\u2019 ability to deploy the American Centrifuge technology, on its liquidity, and on the long-term viability of Centrus\u2019 LEU business.\nThe potential for DOE to seek to terminate or exercise its remedies under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement and our other agreements with DOE, or to require modifications to such agreements that are materially adverse to Centrus\u2019 interests, may have adverse consequences on the Company.\nDOE consented to the assumption by Centrus of the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement and other agreements between the Company and DOE subject to an express reservation of all rights, remedies and defenses by DOE and Centrus under those agreements as part of Centrus' Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. The 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement requires Centrus to develop, demonstrate and deploy advanced enrichment technology in accordance with milestones and provides for remedies in the event of a failure to meet a milestone under certain circumstances.\nDOE has specific remedies under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement if Centrus fails to meet a milestone that would materially impact its ability to begin commercial operations of the American Centrifuge Plant on schedule, and such delay was within Centrus\u2019 control or was due to its fault or negligence or if Centrus abandons or constructively abandons the commercial deployment of an advanced enrichment technology. These remedies include terminating the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement, revoking Centrus\u2019 access to DOE\u2019s centrifuge technology that is required for the success of the American Centrifuge project, requiring Centrus to transfer certain rights in the American Centrifuge technology and facilities to DOE, and requiring Centrus to reimburse DOE for certain costs associated with the American Centrifuge project.\nThe 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement provides that if a delaying event beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of Centrus occurs that could affect Centrus\u2019 ability to meet an American Centrifuge Plant milestone, DOE and Centrus will jointly meet to discuss in good faith possible adjustments to the milestones as appropriate to accommodate the delaying event. The Company notified DOE that it had not met the June 2014 milestone within the time period currently provided due to events beyond its control and without the fault or negligence of the Company. The assumption of the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement provided for under the Plan of Reorganization did not impact the ability of either party to assert all rights, remedies and defenses under the agreement and all such rights, remedies and defenses are specifically preserved and all time limits tolled expressly including all rights, remedies and defenses and time limits relating to any missed milestones. DOE and Centrus have agreed that all rights, remedies and defenses of the parties with respect to any missed milestones since March 5, 2014, including the June 2014 and November 2014 milestones, and all other matters under the June 2002 Agreement continued to be preserved, and that the time limits for each party to respond to any missed milestones continue to be tolled.\nWe anticipate that the parties will address the milestones and other matters under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement at an appropriate time. However, the parties may not be able to reach agreement on appropriate modifications to the agreements in the future and DOE may seek to exercise remedies under such agreements. Moreover, even if the parties reach agreement on modifications to such agreements, there is no assurance that such modifications will not impose material additional requirements, provide DOE with material additional rights or remedies or otherwise affect the overall economics of the American Centrifuge Plant and the ability to finance and successfully deploy the project. Any of these actions could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nCentrus also granted to DOE an irrevocable, non-exclusive right to use or permit third parties on behalf of DOE to use all centrifuge technology intellectual property (\u201cCentrifuge IP\u201d) royalty free for U.S. government purposes (which includes national defense purposes, including providing nuclear material to operate commercial nuclear power reactors for tritium production). Centrus also granted an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to DOE to use such Centrifuge IP developed at its expense for commercial purposes (including a right to sublicense), which may be exercised only if Centrus misses any of the milestones under the 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement or if Centrus (or its affiliate or entity acting through it) is no longer willing or able to proceed with, or has determined to abandon or has constructively abandoned, the commercial deployment of the centrifuge technology. Such a commercial purposes license is subject to payment of an agreed upon royalty to Centrus, which shall not exceed $665 million in the aggregate. Any of these actions could have a material adverse impact on Centrus\u2019 business and prospects.\nEven if market conditions improve, we may not obtain a loan guarantee from DOE and other financing needed to build commercial capacity using the American Centrifuge technology and could demobilize or terminate the project.\nIn July 2008, we applied for a $2 billion loan guarantee under the DOE Loan Guarantee Program, which was established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to construct commercial capacity using the American Centrifuge technology. Instead of moving forward with a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee, in the fall of 2011, DOE proposed the cooperative cost-sharing research, development and demonstration program under the Cooperative Agreement. DOE indicated that the application for a DOE loan guarantee would remain pending. Although we successfully completed the Cooperative Agreement and have been working under the ACTDO Agreement and notwithstanding that we have implemented the restructuring described in the Plan of Reorganization, DOE has given no assurance that a loan guarantee would be provided when market conditions improve sufficiently to support commercialization of the American Centrifuge project. We intend to continue to pursue financing for the ACP in the future, including a DOE loan guarantee; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining a DOE loan guarantee. Factors that could affect our ability to obtain a DOE loan guarantee include:\n\u2022\nthe ability to address DOE\u2019s financial concerns to DOE\u2019s satisfaction;\n\u2022\nthe ability to address any additional concerns that may be raised by DOE as part of its review of our loan guarantee application in the future;\n\u2022\nthe ability to demonstrate to DOE that we can obtain the capital needed to complete the ACP;\n\u2022\nreliance on the continued support of our strategic investor, Toshiba, and obtaining access to financing from the Japanese export credit agencies;\n\u2022\nthe ability to reach agreement with DOE regarding the terms of a loan guarantee conditional commitment;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of any reviews of our loan guarantee application by the DOE credit group, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the Treasury and the National Economic Council, including uncertainty regarding our ability to achieve a manageable credit subsidy cost estimate and to fund any potential capital shortfall that would be created by a high credit subsidy cost; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding the continuation of the DOE Loan Guarantee Program, including the impact of defaults and related investigations under the DOE Loan Guarantee Program.\nWe may take actions in the future if we determine at any time that we do not see a path forward to commercializing the American Centrifuge project, including if we see increased uncertainty with respect to our prospects for obtaining a loan guarantee or other government support, or for other reasons, including as needed to preserve our liquidity. Further cuts in project spending and staffing could make it even more difficult to remobilize the project and could lead to more significant delays and increased costs and potentially make the project uneconomic. Termination of the American Centrifuge project could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects because the long-term competitive position of our LEU business depends on the successful deployment of competitive gas centrifuge enrichment technology.\nCommercial deployment of the American Centrifuge Plant would require significant additional capital, and the sources and timing of obtaining such capital are uncertain and could result in changes in our anticipated ownership of or role in the project.\nOur ability and the timing to proceed with the financing and commercial deployment of the American Centrifuge technology, including the availability of additional government support for deployment of a national security capacity or for commercial deployment, are uncertain. We do not currently have any funding in place for the project following completion of the ACTDO Agreement and, as discussed above, the government\u2019s plans for continuation of the program or for proceeding with a national security capacity and the timing thereof are uncertain. We anticipate that funding will be needed for the project for the period from completion of the current or any subsequent program until the receipt of financing for commercial deployment. The amount of any such funding would depend on a number of factors including whether the government has proceeded with the deployment of a national security capacity as well as the timing of commercial deployment in light of market conditions and the length of time until financing could be obtained for a commercial plant.\nIf we proceed with commercialization of the American Centrifuge project, we expect to need at least $4 billion of capital in order to commercially deploy the ACP based on prior estimates of cost and schedule of commercial deployment. These estimates of costs and schedule for commercial deployment would need to be revised and would depend on a number of factors, including timing and scope of commercial deployment, the government\u2019s decisions with respect to deployment of a national security capacity and remobilization costs, but we expect that the capital needed for commercial deployment would continue to be substantial. The majority of the capital will need to come from third parties. We have applied for a $2 billion loan guarantee under the DOE Loan Guarantee Program and we have also had discussions with Japanese export credit agencies regarding financing up to $1 billion of the cost of completing the ACP, with such potential financing predicated on receiving a DOE loan guarantee. While we have no assurance that those capital sources would be available at the time of commercial deployment, we previously anticipated that under such a financing plan the potential remaining sources for capital could include cash generated by the project during startup, available cash flow from Enrichment Corp.\u2019s operations and additional third-party capital. We are uncertain regarding the amount of cash flow from operations that will be available to fund the project in light of the delays in deployment of the project, reduced cash flow from operations as a result of ceasing enrichment at the Paducah GDP and potential requirements for cash flow to satisfy pension and postretirement benefits, cash interest payments on the Company's notes and other obligations. We have a limited amount of capital that we will be able to contribute to the project going forward. This will affect our share of the ultimate ownership of the project, which may be reduced as a result of raising equity and other capital to commercially deploy the project.\nIn order to successfully raise the necessary capital, we would need to demonstrate a viable business plan that supports loan repayment and provides potential investors with an attractive return on investment based on the project's risk profile, which is not supported by current nuclear fuel market conditions without additional government support. We could also take actions to restructure the American Centrifuge project that could result in changes in our anticipated ownership of or role in the project.\nIncreased costs and cost uncertainty could adversely affect our ability to finance and deploy the ACP.\nThere are significant carrying costs associated with the ACP project and maintaining the project infrastructure. The scope of the overall work under the ACTDO Agreement is reduced from the scope of work that was being conducted by USEC under the prior Cooperative Agreement with DOE. The reduced scope of work does not include activities related to engineering, procurement and construction of the commercial plant; work related to the manufacturing of new centrifuge machines; or design, testing, and procurement of specialty uranium handling equipment necessary to support the uranium enrichment process. In order to align its continued activities with the funding provided under the ACTDO Agreement, Centrus carried out a limited demobilization of those activities not included in the ACTDO Agreement scope of work. In connection with obtaining any financing in the future for commercial deployment we would need to re-establish a number of suppliers to complete the project. We may not be able to utilize prior suppliers and the costs of using or developing new suppliers may be significantly higher than prior cost estimates. Further, suppliers may not be willing to provide contracts on terms that are acceptable to us or potential lenders or at all. The cost and schedule for the project would depend on a large variety of factors, including how we ultimately deploy the project and the timing thereof, decisions by DOE and Congress on whether to extend, revise or terminate the ACTDO Agreement or a successor program and on the preferred option (if any) for maintaining a domestic enrichment capability to meet national security requirements as well as the scope, schedule, cost and funding for such option, the outcome of future discussions with suppliers, changes in commodity and other costs, and the ability to develop and implement cost saving and value engineering actions. There is no assurance that we will achieve required schedule or target costs for the project or that we will develop a viable business plan for commercial deployment that supports loan repayment and provides potential investors with an attractive return on investment based on the project's risk profile, which as described above is not supported by current nuclear fuel market conditions without additional government support.\nFurther increases in the cost of the ACP would increase the amount of external capital we must raise and would adversely affect our ability to successfully finance and deploy the ACP. The costs associated with the ACP may be materially higher than anticipated. Cost estimates and budget for the ACP have been, and will continue to be, based on many assumptions that are subject to change as new information becomes available or as events occur. Uncertainty surrounding our ability to accurately estimate costs or to limit potential cost increases could adversely affect our ability to successfully finance and deploy the ACP. Inability to finance and deploy the ACP could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects because the long-term competitive position of our LEU business depends on the successful deployment of competitive gas centrifuge enrichment technology.\nThe centrifuge machines and supporting equipment deployed in the American Centrifuge Plant may not meet performance or availability targets over the life of the project.\nThe target output for the American Centrifuge Plant is based on assumptions regarding performance and availability of centrifuge machines and related equipment and actual performance may be different than expected. Factors that can influence performance include:\n\u2022\nthe performance and reliability of individual centrifuge components;\n\u2022\nthe availability and performance of plant support systems;\n\u2022\nthe operable lives of individual components and the level of maintenance required to sustain overall plant availability;\n\u2022\nthe ability to acquire or manufacture replacement parts for centrifuges or plant support systems when needed; and\n\u2022\ndifferences in actual commercial plant conditions from the conditions used to establish and test design criteria.\nIn particular, work under the ACTDO Agreement includes addressing an issue identified in February 2014, following successful completion of the 60-day commercial demonstration cascade operation test at the end of 2013. While details are classified, failure to resolve this issue would increase maintenance costs over the life of a centrifuge plant that could impact commercial plant economics. As with other matters that the Company has addressed throughout the American Centrifuge technology development program, mitigating actions are being evaluated and implemented and are expected to successfully resolve the issue; however, there is no assurance that the issue will be resolved and will not impact overall plant availability and economics, including capital required for construction, and costs of maintenance and operation.\nFailure to achieve targeted performance over the life of the American Centrifuge Plant could affect the overall economics of the American Centrifuge Plant and the ability to finance and successfully deploy the project. This could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nWe face risks associated with reliance on third-party suppliers to meet customer commitments as well as for key components for our American Centrifuge program. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain replacement suppliers or re-establish suppliers for such components for the commercial deployment of the technology.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide essential services to the Company, such as the storage and management of inventory, transportation and radiation protection. We face the risk that those third-party service providers may not perform on time, with the desired quality or at all for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside our control. Alternative third-party suppliers may not be readily available or may be more costly. As a result of such risks, we may be unable to meet our customer commitments, our costs could be higher than planned, and our relationship with customers could be negatively affected, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nPeriodically, events or issues arise that may affect the performance of our suppliers. In such circumstances, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that such issues are addressed in a manner that minimizes the impacts to the Company and our customers and that meets our high standards for ethical business conduct. However, there can be no assurance that when such issues arise or otherwise, that the steps we are able to take will effectively address those risks and minimize potential impacts to the Company and our customers. Unless adequately addressed, such events or issues could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nIn particular, we rely on third-party suppliers for key American Centrifuge components. The scope of the overall work under the ACTDO Agreement is reduced from the scope of work that we conducted under the prior Cooperative Agreement with DOE. The reduced scope of work does not include activities related to engineering, procurement and construction of the commercial plant; work related to the manufacturing of new centrifuge machines; or design, testing, and procurement of specialty uranium handling equipment necessary to support the uranium enrichment process. Following the Cooperative Agreement, in order to align its continued activities with the funding provided under the ACTDO Agreement, Centrus carried out a limited demobilization of those activities not included in the ACTDO Agreement scope of work. As a result, contracts with key suppliers were terminated or suspended.\nIt is uncertain whether we will be able to re-establish contracts with prior suppliers when market conditions permit commercial deployment or if such suppliers will remain willing or able to provide the necessary components. There are a limited number of potential suppliers for these key components and finding alternate suppliers could be difficult, time consuming and costly. Because of this, our ability to obtain favorable contractual terms with these suppliers may be limited.\nWe are dependent on the continued cooperation and support of Toshiba.\nToshiba has been an important strategic partner to us in our effort to deploy the American Centrifuge project. Its support was evidenced in the investment transactions that resulted in Toshiba acquiring the Old Preferred Stock and agreeing to make additional investments conditioned upon, among other things, progress in obtaining a loan guarantee from DOE. Although the conditions were not satisfied prior to our Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, and thus no additional investments were made, Toshiba has continued to evidence its support and continues to maintain its investment in Centrus. If Toshiba were to withdraw its support for the American Centrifuge project, it could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to deploy the ACP and on our business and prospects. The ability to obtain Japanese export credit agency financing is highly dependent on the continued support by Japanese industry. If the ability to obtain Japanese export credit agency financing were adversely affected, this would also adversely affect our ability to obtain a DOE loan guarantee and complete the ACP.\nChanges in the price for SWU or uranium could affect gross profit margins and the ability to service indebtedness and finance the American Centrifuge project.\nThe events at Fukushima and its aftermath have negatively affected the balance of supply and demand, and there is limited uncommitted demand for LEU prior to the end of the decade. This supply/demand imbalance was reflected in lower uranium and nuclear fuel prices during 2012, 2013 and 2014. These market prices for our products are at their lowest levels in more than a decade. Changes in the price for SWU and uranium are also influenced by numerous other factors, such as:\n\u2022\nLEU and uranium production levels and costs in the industry;\n\u2022\nactions taken by governments to regulate, protect or promote trade in nuclear material, including the continuation of existing restrictions on unfairly priced imports;\n\u2022\nactions taken by governments to narrow, reduce or eliminate limits on trade in nuclear material, including the decrease or elimination of existing restrictions on unfairly priced imports;\n\u2022\nthe release by governments of stockpiles of enriched and natural uranium without consideration of the adverse impact of the availability of those stockpiles on producers;\n\u2022\nactions of competitors;\n\u2022\nexchange rates;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of alternate fuels; and\n\u2022\ninflation.\nLEU may be produced by downblending government stockpiles of highly enriched uranium. Governments control the timing and availability of highly enriched uranium released for this purpose, and the release of this material to the market could impact market conditions. In the past, we have been a primary supplier of downblended highly enriched uranium made available by the U.S. and Russian governments. Given the current oversupplied nuclear fuel market, any additional LEU from downblended highly enriched uranium released into the market would have a significant negative effect on prices for LEU.\nThe long-term nature of SWU sales contracts delays the impact of any material change in market prices and may prolong any adverse impact of low market prices on gross profit margins. For example, even if prices increase and new higher-priced contracts are secured, the contractual obligations under contracts signed prior to the increase are to deliver LEU and uranium at the lower prices. A decrease in the price for SWU could also affect our future ability to service our indebtedness and finance the American Centrifuge project.\nLow market prices for LEU may adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from the Russian Supply Agreement. See also the Risk Factor, We may be unable to sell all of the commercial Russian LEU that is purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement for prices that cover our purchase costs, which could adversely affect profitability and the viability of our business; restrictions on imports or sales of Russian LEU could adversely affect the ability to sell commercial Russian LEU purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement.\nWe face significant competition from three major producers who may be less cost sensitive or may be favored due to national loyalties and from emerging competitors.\nWe compete with three major producers of LEU, all of which are wholly or substantially owned by governments: Areva (France), Rosatom/TENEX (Russia) and Urenco (Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom). These competitors use centrifuge technology to enrich uranium. In addition, Urenco is currently expanding its centrifuge production capacity.\nThere is also the potential that any of these suppliers will further increase their expansion rates in the long term from what they have announced, or for Areva to proceed with a currently suspended planned expansion in the United States. All of these represent competition in our efforts to sell SWU, including output from the ACP. We also face competition from China and others.\nOur competitors have greater financial resources than we do, including access to below-market financing terms. Foreign competitors enjoy support from their government owners, which may enable them to be less cost- or profit-sensitive than us. In addition, decisions by foreign competitors may be influenced by political and economic policy considerations rather than commercial considerations. For example, foreign competitors may elect to increase their production or exports of LEU, even when not justified by market conditions, thereby depressing prices and reducing demand for LEU, which could adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations. Similarly, the elimination or weakening of existing restrictions on imports from foreign competitors could adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nDependence on our largest customers could adversely affect us.\nIn 2014, our 10 largest customers represented 95% of total revenue and our three largest customers represented 62% of total revenue. A reduction in purchases from our largest customers, whether due to their decision not to purchase optional quantities or for other reasons, including a disruption in their operations that reduces their need for LEU from us, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are seeing increased price competition as competitors and secondary suppliers lower their prices to sell excess supply created by current market conditions. This has adversely affected our sales efforts. Because price is a significant factor in a customer\u2019s choice of a supplier of LEU, when contracts come up for renewal, customers may reduce their purchases from us if we are not able to compete on price, resulting in the loss of new sales contracts. Historically, our ability to compete on price has been limited by the higher operating costs at the Paducah GDP than competitors who operated centrifuge facilities and are protected from competition in their home markets. Once lost, customers may be difficult to regain because they typically purchase LEU under long-term contracts. Therefore, given the need to maintain existing customer relationships, particularly with the largest customers, our ability to raise prices in order to respond to increases in costs or other developments may be limited. In addition, because we have a commitment to acquire Russian LEU under the Russian Supply Agreement, any reduction in purchases by the customers below the level required for us to resell both our inventory and the Russian material could adversely affect revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe ability to compete in certain foreign markets may be limited for political, legal and economic reasons.\nAgreements for cooperation between the U.S. government and various foreign governments or governmental agencies control the export of nuclear materials from the United States. If any of the agreements governing exports to countries in which customers are located were to lapse, terminate or be amended, it is possible sales could no longer be made or LEU could no longer be delivered to customers in those countries. This could adversely affect our results of operations.\nPurchases of LEU by customers in the European Union are subject to a policy of the Euratom Supply Agency that seeks to limit foreign enriched uranium to no more than 20% of European Union consumption per year. Application of this policy to consumption in the European Union of the LEU that we supply or purchase can significantly limit our ability to make sales to European customers.\nFurther, geopolitical events such as the developments in Ukraine, including domestic or international reactions or responses to such events and subsequent government or international actions including the imposition of sanctions, could also impact our ability to purchase, sell or make deliveries of LEU from Russia to customers.\nCertain emerging markets lack a comprehensive nuclear liability law that protects suppliers by channeling liability for injury and property damage suffered by third persons from nuclear incidents at a nuclear facility to the facility\u2019s operator. To the extent a country does not have such a law and has not otherwise provided nuclear liability protection for suppliers to the projects to which we supply SWU, we intend to negotiate terms in customer contracts that we believe will adequately protect us in a manner consistent with this channeling principle. However, if a customer is unwilling to agree to such contract terms, the lack of clear protection for suppliers in the national laws of these countries could adversely affect our ability to compete for sales to meet the growing demand for LEU in these markets and our prospects for future revenue from such sales.\nThe dollar amount of the sales backlog, as stated at any given time, is not necessarily indicative of future sales revenues and is subject to uncertainty.\nBacklog is the estimated aggregate dollar amount of SWU and uranium sales that we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods under existing contracts with customers. There is no assurance that the revenues projected in the backlog will be realized, or, if realized, will result in profits. Most of our contracts provide for fixed purchases of SWU during a given year. Our estimate of backlog is partially based on customers\u2019 estimates of the timing and size of their fuel requirements and other assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Backlog is also based on estimates of selling prices, which are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, prices may be adjusted based on escalation using a general inflation index, published SWU or uranium market price indicators prevailing at the time of delivery, and other factors, all of which are unpredictable, particularly in light of general uncertainty in the nuclear market and the economy generally. We use external composite forecasts of future market prices and inflation rates in our pricing estimates. These forecasts may not be accurate, and therefore estimates of future prices could be overstated. Any inaccuracy in estimates of future prices would add to the imprecision of the backlog estimate.\nFor a variety of reasons, the amounts of SWU and uranium that we will sell in the future under existing contracts, and the timing of customer purchases under those contracts, may differ from estimates. Customers may not purchase as much as we predicted, nor at the times we anticipated, as a result of operational difficulties, changes in fuel requirements or other reasons. Reduced purchases would reduce the revenues we actually receive from contracts included in the backlog. Customers could also seek to modify or cancel orders in response to concerns regarding our financial strength or future business prospects. Further, financial and operational issues facing our customers could affect the backlog.\nThe backlog includes sales prices that are significantly above current market prices. Therefore, customers may seek to limit their obligations under existing contracts or may be unwilling to continue contracts that have termination rights. The backlog also includes contracts that may need to be revised to reflect anticipated supply sources during the transition period. Some long-term contracts in our backlog were established with milestones related to the ACP that permit termination with respect to portions of the contract under limited circumstances that vary across the contracts. While we have waived, eliminated or renegotiated those termination rights where possible, we estimate that approximately 40% of our backlog remains at various levels of risk due to milestones related to deployment of the ACP. Some of these customers have indicated they expect to exercise such contract termination rights, and where one customer purported to exercise its right to terminate, we are disputing that action. We are also working with customers to modify contracts that have delivery, scheduling, origin or other terms that may require modifications to address our anticipated supply sources during the transition period. We have no assurance that our customers will agree to revise existing contracts or will not seek to exercise contract termination rights or require concessions, which could adversely affect the value of our backlog. A loss of all or part of the existing backlog, or a reduction in its value, also could adversely affect our ability to secure adequate contracts to support commercialization of the American Centrifuge project and the likelihood that we will succeed in securing financing for, or deploying, the ACP and thereby adversely affect our prospects.\nUnless market conditions improve or we lower price to compete with excess supply, we expect to continue to see a reduction to our sales backlog over time. Our ability to make new sales is also constrained by the uncertainty about the future prospects associated with the transition from production at the Paducah GDP to commercial production at the ACP. During the period of transition to commercialization of the ACP, we anticipate a lower level of revenue and sales, aligned with our anticipated sources of LEU. As the time frame for potential commercialization of the ACP becomes longer, these issues could be exacerbated.\nThe sources of supply to meet existing backlog will include LEU delivered under the Russian Supply Agreement, which is subject to U.S. government quotas in the U.S. market and foreign trade restrictions in other markets, and which does not fit the origin requirements of a few contracts in the backlog. To the extent our delivery obligations cannot be fully met with Russian LEU under the Russian Supply Agreement, we expect to rely on inventory and purchases from suppliers of non-Russian LEU (and, in the future, supply from the ACP). Our inventories and the LEU we plan to purchase will have origins that are acceptable under existing contracts with our customers. We could also seek a relaxation of trade restrictions or an increase in quotas available to us, but the timing, cost and availability of any these options is uncertain.\nOur future prospects are tied directly to the nuclear energy industry worldwide.\nPotential events that could affect either nuclear reactors under current or future contracts with us or the nuclear industry as a whole, include:\n\u2022\naccidents, terrorism or other incidents at nuclear facilities or involving shipments of nuclear materials;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions or changes in regulations by nuclear regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\ndecisions by agencies, courts or other bodies that limit our ability to seek relief under applicable trade laws to offset unfair competition or pricing by foreign competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in other areas of the nuclear fuel cycle, such as uranium supplies or conversion;\n\u2022\ncivic opposition to, or changes in government policies regarding, nuclear operations;\n\u2022\nbusiness decisions concerning reactors or reactor operations;\n\u2022\nthe need for generating capacity; or\n\u2022\nconsolidation within the electric power industry.\nThese events could adversely affect us to the extent they result in a reduction or elimination of customers\u2019 contractual requirements to purchase from us, the suspension or reduction of nuclear reactor operations, the reduction of supplies of raw materials, lower demand, burdensome regulation, disruptions of shipments or production, increased competition from third parties, increased operational costs or difficulties or increased liability for actual or threatened property damage or personal injury.\nChanges to, or termination of, any agreements with the U.S. government, or deterioration in our relationship with the U.S. government, could adversely affect results of operations.\nWe are a party to a number of agreements and arrangements with the U.S. government that are important to the business, including:\n\u2022\nleases for the American Centrifuge facilities;\n\u2022\nthe 2002 DOE-USEC Agreement and other agreements that address issues relating to the domestic uranium enrichment industry and centrifuge technology; and\n\u2022\nthe ACTDO Agreement with UT-Battelle as operator of ORNL for DOE.\nTermination or expiration of one or more of these agreements, without replacement with an equivalent agreement or arrangement that accomplishes the same objectives as the terminated or expired agreement(s), could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, deterioration in our relationship with the U.S. agencies that are parties to these agreements could impair or impede our ability to successfully implement these agreements which could adversely affect results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in collecting amounts due from DOE related to U.S. government contract work.\nWe previously performed services under contract with DOE and its contractors at the Portsmouth GDP and the Paducah GDP. We may not be successful in collecting unpaid receivables from DOE for such work. Certain receivables from DOE are included in other long-term assets based on the extended timeframe expected to resolve claims for payment. We believe DOE has breached its agreements by failing to establish appropriate provisional billing and final indirect cost rates on a timely basis and the Company has filed claims with DOE for payment under the Contract Disputes Act (\"CDA\"). DOE denied our initial claims for payment of $38.0 million for the periods through 2011, and on May 30, 2013, the Company appealed DOE's denial of its claims to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. We have been able to reach a resolution on a portion of the amounts claimed and DOE has now paid approximately $6 million of claims for work performed in 2003 through 2005. The Court dismissed claims against DOE related to approximately $3.8 million due from prime subcontractors to DOE and we intend to pursue payment of such claims directly from the DOE contractors.\nIn December 2012, we invoiced DOE for $42.8 million, representing its share of pension and postretirement benefits costs related to the transition of Portsmouth site employees to DOE's D&D contractor, as permitted by CAS and based on CAS calculation methodology. DOE denied payment on this invoice in January 2013 and subsequent to providing additional information, as requested, to DOE, the Company submitted a claim on August 30, 2013 under the CDA for payment of the $42.8 million. On August 27, 2014, the DOE contracting officer denied our claim. As a result, we filed a complaint with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in January 2015 but there is no assurance we will be successful in our appeal. This claim has a full valuation allowance in our records due to the lack of a resolution with DOE and uncertainty regarding the amounts owed and the timing of collection. The amounts owed by DOE may be more than the amounts we have invoiced to date. Further, on February 5, 2015, we filed claims with DOE for payment under the CDA for approximately $1.6 million related to services performed in 2013. We believe that DOE improperly reduced its payment by applying a duplicative credit that had previously been applied to a 2011 invoice. We also filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims since the DOE action relates to the pending litigation and to preserve the Company\u2019s rights. There is no assurance that we will be successful in these claims or recover any additional amounts for these past due receivables.\nOur operations are highly regulated by the NRC and DOE.\nOur operations are subject to regulation by the NRC. The centrifuge demonstration cascade in Ohio and the construction and operation of the ACP are licensed and regulated by the NRC. The license for ACP activities is held by American Centrifuge Operating, LLC.\nThe NRC could refuse to renew our licenses if it determines that: (1) we are foreign owned, controlled or dominated; (2) the issuance of a renewed license would be inimical to the maintenance of a reliable and economic domestic source of enrichment; (3) the issuance of a renewed license would be adverse to U.S. defense or security objectives; or (4) the issuance of a renewed license is otherwise not consistent with applicable laws or regulations in effect at the time of renewal.\nThe NRC has the authority to issue notices of violation for violations of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the NRC regulations and conditions of licenses, certificates of compliance, or orders. The NRC has the authority to impose civil penalties or additional requirements and to order cessation of operations for violations of its regulations. Penalties under the NRC regulations could include substantial fines, imposition of additional requirements or withdrawal or suspension of licenses or certificates. Any penalties imposed on Centrus could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The NRC also has the authority to issue new regulatory requirements or to change existing requirements. Changes to the regulatory requirements could also adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, the American Centrifuge project development and manufacturing facilities in Oak Ridge, and certain operations at our other facilities, are subject to regulation by DOE. DOE has the authority to impose civil penalties and additional requirements, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations require that we maintain security clearances that are overseen by the NRC and DOE in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. These security clearances could be suspended or revoked if Centrus is determined by the NRC to be subject to foreign ownership, control or influence.\nFailures or security breaches of information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires us to use and protect classified and other protected information. Our computer networks and other IT systems are designed to protect this information through the use of classified networks and other procedures. A material network breach in the security of the IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property. To the extent any security breach results in a loss or damage to data, or in inappropriate disclosure of classified or other protected information, it could cause grave damage to the country\u2019s national security and to our business. One of the biggest threats to classified information we protect comes from the insider threat - an employee with legitimate access who engages in misconduct. Transitions in the business, in particular the potential for employee layoffs and other transitions, can increase the risk that an insider with access could steal our intellectual property.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations.\nWe incur costs for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed wastes generated as a result of operations at the American Centrifuge project. Unanticipated events or regulatory developments could cause the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures to vary substantially from those expected.\nPursuant to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, we are required to hold multiple permits related to the American Centrifuge project. Some permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions, and we cannot predict whether we will be able to renew such permits or whether material changes in permit conditions will be imposed. Changes to or an inability to obtain or renew permits could increase costs or impact our ability to meet our obligations to customers and could adversely impact our results of operations and ability to finance the ACP.\nOur operations involve the use, transportation and disposal of toxic, hazardous and/or radioactive materials and could result in liability without regard to fault or negligence\nOur operations involve the use of toxic, hazardous and radioactive materials. A release of these materials could pose a health risk to humans or animals. If an accident were to occur, its severity would depend on the volume of the release and the speed of corrective action taken by plant emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and wind conditions. Actions taken in response to an actual or suspected release of these materials, including a precautionary evacuation, could result in significant costs for which we could be legally responsible. In addition to health risks, a release of these materials may cause damage to, or the loss of, property and may adversely affect property values.\nWe lease facilities from DOE at the ACP and centrifuge test facilities in Piketon, Ohio and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, DOE has indemnified the Company against claims for public liability (as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended) arising out of or in connection with activities under those leases resulting from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation. If an incident or evacuation is not covered under the DOE indemnification, we could be financially liable for damages arising from such incident or evacuation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The DOE indemnification does not apply to incidents outside the United States, including in connection with international transportation of LEU.\nWhile DOE has provided indemnification pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, there could be delays in obtaining reimbursement for costs from DOE and DOE may determine that some or all costs are not reimbursable under the indemnification.\nHistorically, we did not maintain any nuclear liability insurance for our operations at the Paducah GDP site. Further, American Nuclear Insurers, the only provider of nuclear liability insurance, has declined to provide nuclear liability insurance to the ACP due to past and present DOE operations on the site. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act indemnification does not cover loss or damage to property located on the leased facilities due to a nuclear incident.\nIn our contracts, we seek to protect ourselves from liability, but there is no assurance that such contractual limitations on liability will be effective in all cases. The costs of defending against a claim arising out of a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation, and any damages awarded as a result of such a claim, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLevels of returns on pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the amounts to be contributed to fund future pension and postretirement benefit liabilities could adversely affect earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nEarnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for employee benefit plans. This is particularly true with expense for the pension and postretirement benefit plans. GAAP require a company to calculate expense for these plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension and postretirement benefit expenses for the following year are the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The rate of return on pension assets and changes in interest rates affect funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans. The IRS and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 regulate the minimum amount we contribute to our pension plans. The amount required to contribute to pension plans can have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments that are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this report for a discussion of assumptions, estimates and judgments related to our accounting for asset valuations, American Centrifuge decontamination and decommissioning obligations, pension and postretirement health and life benefit costs and obligations and income taxes. Changes in accounting rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nRevenue is recognized at the time LEU or uranium is delivered under the terms of customer contracts. Customer demand is affected by, among other things, electricity markets, reactor operations, maintenance and the timing of refueling outages. Utilities typically schedule the shutdown of their reactors for refueling to coincide with the low electricity demand periods of spring and fall. Thus, some reactors are scheduled for annual or two-year refuelings in the spring or fall, or for 18-month cycles alternating between both seasons. Customer payments for the SWU component of LEU typically average approximately $15 to $20 million per order. As a result, a relatively small change in the timing of customer orders for LEU due to a change in a customer\u2019s refueling schedule may cause operating results to be substantially above or below expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows.\nCentrus is dependent on intercompany support from Enrichment Corp.\nSubstantially all revenue-generating operations of the Company are conducted at the subsidiary level. Centrus performs work under the ACTDO Agreement with UT-Battelle for continued cascade operations and continuation of core American Centrifuge research and technology activities and the furnishing of related reports to ORNL. Centrus\u2019 principal source of funding of American Centrifuge activities is provided under the fixed-price ACTDO Agreement and funding provided by Enrichment Corp. to Centrus and its wholly owned subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating, LLC (\u201cACO\u201d), pursuant to two secured intercompany financing notes (the \"Intercompany Notes\"). The Intercompany Notes are demand notes and are secured by substantially all of the assets of Centrus and ACO, respectively. The financing obtained from Enrichment Corp. funds American Centrifuge activities pending receipt of payments related to work performed under the ACTDO Agreement, American Centrifuge costs that are outside the scope of work under the ACTDO Agreement, including costs of the limited demobilization and contract termination costs resulting from the reduction in scope of work under the ACTDO Agreement as compared to the scope of work under the prior Cooperative Agreement with DOE, and general corporate expenses, including cash interest payments on the New Notes. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrus, Enrichment Corp. has its own set of creditors and a separate board of directors, including independent directors (the \u201cEnrichment Board\u201d), who are elected by Centrus. The Enrichment Board has authorized Enrichment Corp. to provide such funding and to provide a guarantee with respect to the New Notes issued under the Plan of Reorganization. Such current and future funding and support are conditional and dependent on Enrichment Corp.\u2019s own financial condition and a determination by the Enrichment Board that such funding is in the interest of Enrichment Corp.\nOur failure to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the NYSE MKT could result in a delisting of our Class A Common Stock and would impair stockholders\u2019 ability to sell or purchase our Class A Common Stock.\nAs announced on March 11, 2015, at the request of the Company, the NYSE transferred the listing of Centrus common stock that trades under the ticker \u201cLEU\u201d to the NYSE\u2019s MKT trading platform. The NYSE MKT\u2019s continued listing standards are more aligned with our new capital structure, trading volume and share price since emerging from bankruptcy. On March 16, 2015, LEU began trading on the NYSE MKT. Given the limited period of trading since our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the substantially changed capital structure of the Company, among other factors, there is no assurance that we will continue to meet the NYSE MKT's continued listing standards, including with respect to our overall financial condition and results of operations. A delisting of our Class A Common Stock by the NYSE MKT and the failure of our Class A Common Stock to be listed on another national exchange could have significant adverse consequences. A delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock and would impair stockholders\u2019 ability to sell or purchase our Class A Common Stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives us certain rights with respect to equity securities held (beneficially or of record) by foreign persons. If levels of foreign ownership set forth in our certificate of incorporation are exceeded, we have the right, among other things, to redeem or exchange New Common Stock held by foreign persons, and in certain cases, the applicable redemption price or exchange value may be equal to the lower of fair market value or a foreign person\u2019s purchase price.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives us certain rights with respect to shares of our New Common Stock held (beneficially or of record) by foreign persons. Foreign persons are defined in our certificate of incorporation to include, among others, an individual who is not a U.S. citizen, an entity that is organized under the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and an entity that is controlled by individuals who are not U.S. citizens or by entities that are organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the following events is a \u201cforeign ownership review event\u201d and triggers the board of directors\u2019 right to take various actions under our certificate of incorporation: (1) the beneficial ownership by a foreign person of (a) 5% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of our equity securities, (b) 5% or more in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of our equity securities, or (c) less than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of our equity securities or less than 5% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of all classes of our equity securities, if such foreign person is entitled to control the appointment and tenure of any of our management positions or any director; (2) the beneficial ownership of any shares of any class of our equity securities by or for the account of a foreign uranium enrichment provider or a foreign competitor (defined in our certificate of incorporation as a \u201cContravening Person\u201d); or (3) any ownership of, or exercise of rights with respect to, shares of any class of our equity securities or other exercise or attempt to exercise control of us that is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any regulatory restrictions, or that could jeopardize the continued operations of our facilities (defined in our certificate of incorporation as an \u201cAdverse Regulatory Occurrence\u201d). These rights include requesting information from holders (or proposed holders) of our securities, refusing to permit the transfer of securities by such holders, suspending or limiting voting rights of such holders, redeeming or exchanging shares of our stock owned by such holders on terms set forth in our certificate of incorporation, and taking other actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions.\nThe terms and conditions of our rights with respect to our redemption or exchange right in respect of shares held by foreign persons or Contravening Persons are as follows:\n\u2022\nRedemption price or exchange value: Generally, the redemption price or exchange value for any shares of our New Common Stock redeemed or exchanged would be their fair market value. However, if we redeem or exchange shares held by foreign persons or Contravening Persons and our Board in good faith determines that such person knew or should have known that its ownership would constitute a foreign ownership review event (other than shares for which our Board determined at the time of the person\u2019s purchase that the ownership of, or exercise of rights with respect to, such shares did not at such time constitute an Adverse Regulatory Occurrence), the redemption price or exchange value is required to be the lesser of fair market value and the person\u2019s purchase price for the shares redeemed or exchanged.\n\u2022\nForm of payment: Cash, securities or a combination, valued by our Board in good faith.\n\u2022\nNotice: At least 30 days written notice of redemption is required; however, if we have deposited the cash or securities for the redemption or exchange in trust for the benefit of the relevant holders, we may redeem shares held by such holders on the same day that we provide notice.\nAccordingly, there are situations in which a foreign stockholder or Contravening Person could lose the right to vote its shares or in which we may redeem or exchange shares held by a foreign person or Contravening Person and in which such redemption or exchange could be at the lesser of fair market value and the person\u2019s purchase price for the shares redeemed or exchanged, which could result in a significant loss for that person.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and in our charter, bylaws and in the indenture governing our New Notes could delay or prevent an acquisition of us.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire control of our company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. Our certificate of incorporation, or charter, establishes restrictions on foreign ownership of our securities. Other provisions of our charter and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors. These various restrictions could deprive shareholders of the opportunity to realize takeover premiums for their shares. In addition, the Indenture governing our New Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the New Notes. These and other provisions could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to stockholders.", "PERMNO": 86233, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "LEU"}
