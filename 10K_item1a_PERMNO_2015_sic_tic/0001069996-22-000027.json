RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks in our business operations as described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are the known risk factors we consider material. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Investors should carefully consider these risks before making an investment decision.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nManagement has concluded the Company does not qualify as a going concern, and could be placed into receivership or experience an event of default that would accelerate the mandatory repayment of our debt.\nThe Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company recently received notice from Demotech that FNIC\u2019s rating has been downgraded from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cS.\u201d The Company believes that the downgrade of FNIC\u2019s Demotech rating will adversely impact our ability to obtain excess-of-loss reinsurance for coverage beginning July 1, 2022. Absent such coverage, the Company will not be in compliance with requirements communicated by the Office of Insurance Regulation of the state of Florida regarding such coverage, which could ultimately result in the Company being placed into receivership. Additionally, being placed into receivership and/or failing to obtain excess-of-loss reinsurance each represent potential defaults under the applicable covenants of our senior debt indentures that could result in acceleration of repayment of our debt. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to comply with certain covenants in our senior note indentures or to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event we cannot do so. Such conditions raise substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Further, the Company\u2019s conclusion that there is substantial doubt with respect to its ability to continue to as a going concern is expected to result in increased regulatory oversight of the Company\u2019s operations by the OIR, as evidenced by the consent order entered into by the Company on April 21, 2022 (see Going Concern in \u201cPart I, Item I. Business, Insurance Operations and Related Services\u201d of this annual report for further discussion of the consent order).\nOur financial condition is adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters.\nWe write insurance policies that cover homeowners for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes and sinkholes. Catastrophic losses can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, wind, hail, brush fires, explosions and other events. The incidence and severity of these events are inherently unpredictable. Catastrophic losses can also be caused by terrorist attacks, war, riots, political instability and other man-made events. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of two factors: the total amount of the insurance company\u2019s exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Our homeowners policyholders are disbursed throughout the southeast United States, although the majority of our policyholders are located in Florida. Further, a substantial portion of our Florida homeowners policyholders are located in south Florida, and therefore are especially subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms.\nThe occurrence of claims from catastrophic events has resulted in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year, as seen in 2021, 2020 and 2019, and we expect such volatility to continue. An elevation in the values and concentrations of insured property may increase the severity of the occurrence of claims in the future. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations. As a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFlorida, Louisiana and Texas, all states in which we write homeowners policies, collectively, experienced several significant hurricanes in 2021, 2020 and 2019, which some weather analysts believe is consistent with a period of greater hurricane activity. Exposure risk management alternatives are carefully evaluated as they may increase operating expenses and may not be successful in protecting long-term profitability. If our loss experience is more adverse than is contemplated by our loss reserves, the related increase in our loss reserves may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs.\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we are impacted by different severe weather events at different times of the year.\nOur homeowners business is impacted by catastrophic and other severe weather events, which causes our operating results and financial condition to vary significantly from one period to the next. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable, although certain types of events are more likely to occur during particular times of year. For example, hurricane season\nin the Atlantic and Caribbean oceans and in the Gulf of Mexico is from June 1st to November 30th of each year, with the peak occurrence of storms typically from mid-August to late October. By comparison, severe storms resulting in hail and tornados are more likely to occur in the spring in the states in which we have policies. The nature of spring storms also tends to result in multiple occurrences, none of which would typically exceed our catastrophe reinsurance retention on an individual basis. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of claims when severe weather conditions occur.\nAdverse ratings by insurance rating agencies may adversely impact our ability to write new policies, renew desirable policies or obtain adequate reinsurance, which could limit or halt our growth and harm our business.\nThird-party rating agencies assess and rate the ability of insurers to pay their claims. The insurance industry uses financial strength ratings to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings are based on criteria established by the rating agencies and reflect evaluations of each insurer\u2019s profitability, debt and cash levels, customer base, adequacy and soundness of reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of reserves, capital and RBC ratios (e.g. 300%), and management. Ratings are also based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors, such as purchasers of our common stock.\nOur ability to compete successfully in states outside of Florida to expand our business footprint may also be negatively affected by our lack of an A.M. Best company rating of our financial strength. As of December 31, 2021, FNIC and MNIC had Demotech ratings of \u201cA\u201d (Exceptional), which is generally accepted in Florida and certain other states, a rating by A.M. Best is more widely accepted outside of Florida and may cause customers and agents to prefer a policy written by an A.M. Best-rated company over a policy written by us. In addition, some mortgage companies outside of Florida may require homeowners to obtain property insurance from an insurance company with a minimum A.M. Best rating.\nThe Company has recently been notified by Demotech that MNIC\u2019s \u201cA\u201d rating has been reaffirmed; however, FNIC has been downgraded to \u201cS\u201d. The withdrawal or downgrade of our ratings could limit or prevent us from obtaining adequate reinsurance, writing or renewing desirable insurance policies, or competing with insurers who have higher ratings. The withdrawal or downgrade of our ratings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position because our insurance products might no longer be acceptable to the secondary marketplace and mortgage lenders or the related government sponsored entities (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). Furthermore, a withdrawal or downgrade of our ratings could prevent independent agents from selling and servicing our insurance products or could increase the commissions we must pay to these agents.\nOur loss reserves are estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual liability for losses, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liabilities for losses and LAE. These reserves are estimates based on historical data and statistical projections of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known to us. Actual loss and LAE reserves, however, may vary significantly from our estimates. Factors that affect loss and LAE reserves include the estimates made on a claim-by-claim basis known as \u201ccase reserves\u201d coupled with bulk estimates known as IBNR. Periodic estimates by management of the ultimate costs required to settle all claim files are based on our analysis of historical data and estimations of the impact of numerous factors such as:\n\u2022per-claim information;\n\u2022company and industry historical loss experience, including the impact of trends such as the AOB (as described in more detail below) by insureds;\n\u2022legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in the awarding of damages, and changes in political attitudes; and\n\u2022trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation.\nManagement revises its estimates based on the results of its analysis. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for estimating the ultimate settlement of all claims. There is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of the reserves, because the eventual redundancy or deficiency is affected by multiple factors. Because of the uncertainties that surround estimated loss reserves, we cannot be certain that our reserves will be adequate to cover our actual losses. If our loss and LAE reserves are less than actual losses and LAE, we will be required to increase our reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Future loss experience, substantially in excess of our loss and LAE reserves, could substantially harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance companies are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nOur insurance companies are subject to RBC standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws, including the laws of the State of Florida. The RBC standards, based upon the Risk Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require our insurance companies to report their results of RBC calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. These RBC standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company\u2019s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its ACL RBC.\nIf we fail to meet the applicable RBC or minimum statutory capital requirements imposed by the laws of Florida or other states where we do business, we would be required to raise additional capital and we could be subject to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, additional state supervision, receivership or liquidation. Similarly, an increase in existing RBC requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements, such as the catastrophic risk component of RBC may require us to increase our statutory capital levels. Ratios calculated based on RBC also tend to be key criteria in the assignment of ratings by insurance rating agencies.\nThe non-admissibility of the surplus note from MIC to FNIC would cause FNIC to have an immediate additional capital need.\nAs of December 31, 2021, FNIC held a surplus note receivable with a carrying value of $17.1 million payable by MIC. If MIC were to have a ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL below 300% and a combined ratio in excess of 120%, then such surplus note would no longer be an admitted asset (meaning an asset that qualified for treatment as capital for statutory purposes) and FNIC would need replacement surplus to maintain its ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL of 300% or greater. As a result of catastrophe weather events impacting our carriers (including MIC) during the first quarter of 2022, we expect that this surplus note receivable will be non-admitted for purposes of first quarter 2022 statutory reporting.\nWe will likely require additional capital in the near future which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms.\nOur current and future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses, and manage our claims resolution processes. Many factors will affect the amount and timing of our capital needs, including our claims experience, the availability of reinsurance, market disruptions, and regulatory and other unforeseeable developments. In addition, our insurance companies are subject to RBC standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws. To the extent that our capital is insufficient to meet future operating requirements, minimum statutory requirements and the minimal capital expectations of the rating agency that provides Financial Stability Ratings for our insurance subsidiaries, we will be required to raise additional funds through financings or further curtail our business.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have determined to runoff our non-Florida business and, concurrently with that determination, have determined to maintain MIC\u2019s capital at the minimum statutory level but not to the 300% RBC level. Although FNIC and MNIC currently have capital at the 300% RBC level, they may nevertheless require additional capital in the future. When we are required to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders\u2019 ownership could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing shareholders. The Company is precluded from issuing more than $10 million of incremental debt without the approval of existing holders of our debt. If we were to raise additional funds by incurring debt financing the terms of any such debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate our business. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we were unable to meet the applicable RBC or minimum statutory capital requirements imposed by the laws of Florida or other states in which we currently have policies, and were unable to obtain additional capital when needed, we could be subject to corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, additional state supervision, or liquidation.\nAlthough we follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our risks, our costs of obtaining reinsurance in each of the last two years has increased substantially and the terms have become less favorable, with the result that we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through our reinsurance arrangements.\nWe have a reinsurance structure that is a combination of private reinsurance and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (\"FHCF\"). Our reinsurance structure is composed of several reinsurance companies with varying levels of participation providing coverage for\nlosses and LAE at pre-established minimum and maximum amounts. Losses incurred in connection with a catastrophic event below the minimum and above the maximum are the responsibility of FNIC, MIC and MNIC.\nThe availability and costs associated with the acquisition of reinsurance varies year to year, with significant increases occurring in each of the last two years. We are not able to control additional future availability and price increases of reinsurance, which may be significant and may limit our ability to purchase adequate coverage. In addition, when the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries decreases, it decreases the maximum per-event retention allowed by our rating agency and our regulators. While a lower per-event retention has the benefit of reducing our maximum exposure to any single catastrophic event, it also further increases the cost of our reinsurance program. The recovery of increased reinsurance costs through rate increases is not immediate and cannot be presumed, as rate increases are subject to approval of the OIR or LDI.\nWe will experience increased financial exposure due to changes in private excess-of-loss reinsurance market terms and conditions.\nThe private reinsurance market goes through what are known in the industry as \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d market cycles based on factors such as capital availability and expected returns within the reinsurance industry and variations in world-wide and regional weather patterns and other natural or man-made catastrophes that produce higher or lower loss experience than expected for the reinsurance industry. During soft market cycles, where losses have been less than expected, more favorable pricing, terms and conditions are more readily available to us, which reduces our potential exposure by providing broader coverage and at better pricing. During a hard market cycle, when less capital is available, higher returns are expected or where prior losses have been more than expected, private reinsurance markets typically increase pricing and tighten coverage, potentially resulting in more financial exposure to the Company. Certain hard markets can lead to the absence of certain types of reinsurance capacity at any reasonable price. Examples of tighter terms include, but are not limited to, the exclusion of coverage for certain types of weather events, removal of cascading protection and elimination of individual insurance carrier per-event retentions when there are multiple insurance carriers in a group. The reinsurance market for our 2021-2022 reinsurance program was a hard market, with less favorable terms, as described above, on a portion of our July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 property catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance program. In particular, portions of our 2021-2022 program exclude coverage for severe convective storms after hurricane season. Those portions of the reinsurance program that exclude severe convective storms are specifically in the lowest layer of coverage (below approximately $30 million in each tower). As such, other than the potential coverage under certain quota-share reinsurance treaties, the Company will retain 100% of any severe convective storm losses that may occur in this layer. We may determine to purchase additional coverage for such storms, but the Company anticipates that the reinsurance market will remain hard such that additional coverage may not be available or may be on terms, including premiums, unfavorable to us. While it is not possible to know what specific weather events will occur in the future, it is possible that we could experience a large event, or a series of smaller events that in aggregate could materially impact our balance sheet and our ability to comply with the capital requirements of our rating agencies and regulators. Peak season for severe convective storm losses occurs in March through May of each year. Our gross exposure to severe convective storms has been reduced somewhat for the 2022 peak season by the exposure management and runoff initiatives described herein. Such exposure will decrease substantially in future years as we continue to shrink the footprint of our book of business outside of Florida, particularly in Texas and Louisiana.\nWe face a risk of non-collectability of reinsurance, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs is common practice within the insurance industry, we transfer a portion of the risks insured under our policies to other companies through the purchase of reinsurance. This reinsurance is maintained to protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims, unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss and other catastrophic events. Although reinsurance does not discharge our insurance subsidiaries from their respective primary obligations to pay for losses insured under the policies they issue, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiary for the reinsured portion of the risk. A credit exposure exists with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reinsurance structure has significant risks, including the fact that the FHCF or our other reinsurers may not have available capital resources to pay their claims or that their ability to pay their claims in a timely manner may be impaired. This could result in significant financial, legal and operational challenges to our company. Therefore, in the event of a catastrophic loss, we may become dependent upon the FHCF\u2019s and our other reinsurers\u2019 ability to pay their claims. With respect to the FHCF, we may, in turn, be dependent upon the ability of the State Board of Administration of Florida to issue bonds in amounts that would be required to meet its reinsurance obligations in the event of such a catastrophic loss.\nContractual terms within our quota-share reinsurance treaties may limit the extent to which catastrophe losses can be ceded into the treaties, increasing the Company\u2019s net losses retained.\nMany of the Company\u2019s quota-share reinsurance treaties include contractual terms that limit the nature or amount of catastrophe losses that can be ceded into the treaties. For example, the quota-share treaties covering FNIC\u2019s Florida homeowners book of business exclude named storm catastrophe losses and contain caps on non-named storm losses, or exclude them altogether. In addition, the quota-share treaty covering FNIC\u2019s non-Florida book of business includes limits on the net loss that the reinsurer can incur during the treaty year, and has been commuted such that no further losses related to 2021 and prior can be ceded into the treaty. The quota-share treaty covering FNIC\u2019s non-Florida book of business for the period from January 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022 excludes most catastrophe losses altogether.\nA reduction in our future capacity to enter new, renew, or maintain existing quota-share or excess of loss reinsurance treaties could potentially decrease the scope of options available to us in response to managing future statutory surplus needs.\nOur company is dependent on reinsurance to manage our exposure to weather events. We purchase excess of loss reinsurance to satisfy requirements of our state regulators, insurance industry rating agency, and debt rating agency. We also purchase quota-share reinsurance, which assists us in managing the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries. Our inability to maintain, renew or secure excess of loss or quota-share reinsurance at an affordable price, or at any price, could impact our ability to write new business or continue our operations.\nThere are also practical constraints on the total percentage of a given book of business that can be ceded via quota-share reinsurance. During the two years ending December 31, 2021, the quota-share cession percentage on FNIC\u2019s Florida homeowners book of business was increased from 10% to 40%, and the cession percentage on its non-Florida homeowners book was increased from zero to 100%, actions which benefited FNIC\u2019s statutory surplus and RBC ratio. As such, FNIC has reduced capacity to increase the level of quota-share cessions in the future. MIC and MNIC currently have no quota-share treaties in place.\nA future reduction in the amount of quota-share reinsurance in place, upon the expiration of the current treaties or termination of our treaties resulting from a ratings downgrade or the failures of such treaties to pass risk transfer, could reduce existing statutory surplus of the impacted carrier, potentially triggering the need for additional capital infusions.\nTo qualify as reinsurance for accounting purposes, a contract must embody substantive risk transfer, which is defined as the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer could experience a significant loss on the treaty. Contractual provisions in a treaty that excessively limit the extent or timing of the net loss that a reinsurer can experience can conceivably preclude the treaty from meeting the criteria for risk transfer, thereby disqualifying it from reinsurance accounting treatment. An assessment of risk transfer must be performed upon entry into a new treaty, as well as each time the treaty is renewed. Each of our in-force quota-share reinsurance treaties qualified for reinsurance accounting at the time of its most-recent inception. Each of these treaties has a term of one-year or less (refer to Note 6 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for further discussion of these reinsurance treaties). The Company currently expects to be able to renew each of the treaties that it determines beneficial to renew on terms that qualify for continued reinsurance accounting; however, there can be no assurance that the available market terms of these renewals (including pricing, coverage and exclusions) will also pass risk transfer. If a treaty that we desire to renew fails to qualify for reinsurance accounting based on its then-current renewal terms, it could adversely impact that carrier\u2019s statutory surplus, triggering the need for additional capital infusions within a short period of time.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s quota-share treaties contain provisions that give the reinsurer the option to terminate the treaty in the event that our Demotech rating is downgraded or that we are placed into receivership. The termination of any of our quota-share treaties would place additional strain on our statutory surplus.\nWe expect to experience significantly increased financial exposure from climate change.\nA body of scientific evidence strongly indicates that climate change is occurring. Climate change, to the extent that it affects weather patterns, is likely to cause a significant increase in the frequency and/or the severity of catastrophic events or severe weather conditions. Our financial exposure from climate change is most notably associated with losses in connection with the occurrence of hurricanes striking Florida, Louisiana and Texas and severe convective storms occurring in Louisiana and Texas. We mitigate the risk of financial exposure from climate change by restrictive underwriting criteria, sensitivity to geographic concentrations, and reinsurance.\nRestrictive underwriting criteria can include, but are not limited to, limitations on the geographic areas in which we will write policies, higher premiums and deductibles and more specifically excluded policy risks such as fences and screened-in enclosures. New\ntechnological advances in computer generated geographical mapping afford us an enhanced perspective as to geographic concentrations of policyholders and proximity to wind and/or flood-prone areas. Our amount of maximum reinsurance coverage is determined in part by subjecting our homeowners exposures to statistical forecasting models that are designed to quantify a catastrophic event in terms of the frequency of a storm occurring once in every \u201cn\u201d years. The statistical forecasting models have limitations, including the possible failure to contemplate emerging claims trends. This could include the impact of \u201csocial inflation,\u201d where contractors and vendors extract more overages from an insurance policy than it was designed and price to provide, including the rise of \u201ccottage industries\u201d that are more active and aggressive than historical loss data may indicate. The potential failure of these models to capture such emerging trends, such as elevated claims litigation in Florida, gives rise to the risk that we may not purchase adequate catastrophic wind coverage. Our reinsurance coverage contemplates the effects of catastrophic events in a manner that satisfies our regulators, debtholders and our rating agency. Our amount of losses retained (our deductible) and the amount of coverage purchased in connection for any single event and in aggregate for a treaty year are influenced by market capacity, pricing conditions and our need for surplus preservation. There can be no assurance that our reinsurance coverage and other measures taken will be sufficient to mitigate losses resulting from one or more catastrophic events.\nWe are refocusing our operations on the Florida homeowners market, which could have consequences that materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are refocusing our operations on writing Florida homeowners policies by, among other things, allowing our policies outside of Florida to runoff. This process requires us to comply with applicable regulatory requirements when non-renewing our non-Florida policies at their expiration dates. As a result, the runoff of our non-Florida business will occur over a period of approximately 18 months during which policies will remain in effect until their expiration dates. The runoff of our non-Florida business may have consequences that could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations, such as the following:\n\u2022We expect our policies outside of Florida will remain in effect until their individual expiration dates, which means that we may have losses relating to weather events and other insured events in those markets until the policies expire.\n\u2022Our focus on writing policies only in Florida means that catastrophic weather events that impact Florida, such as hurricanes, tornados and hail events, may have a more severe adverse impact on us because of our more limited geographic footprint.\n\u2022As a result of our Florida-only focus, we may experience higher reinsurance costs or less reinsurance availability because of concerns by reinsurers about our lack of geographic diversity.\n\u2022Our decision to wind-down our business outside of Florida could cause agents to stop recommending us to their clients inside of Florida and could cause Florida homeowners seeking insurance to decide to move existing policies or not to obtain new policies from us.\n\u2022We may need to reduce our workforce as a result of the wind-down of our non-Florida operations, which may adversely impact our ability to retain our remaining employees.\n\u2022Non-Florida policies may leave the Company more quickly than expected, which could reduce our available earned premium to pay for certain expenses including ceded excess of loss reinsurance, which was priced based on the Company\u2019s in-force exposure as of September 30, 2021 for the treaty year ending June 30, 2022, and thereby increase our expense ratios.\n\u2022Reputational risk with our investors, reinsurers, staff, agents, vendors and others with whom we interact and compete in our marketplace, which may impact our ability to compete in the competitive marketplace.\n\u2022The Company may be limited in its ability to exit these policies based on regulatory requirements including limitations on cancellations of policies that have recently had a claim, or based on limited ability by SageSure to move these policies to other insurance carriers based on the availability of similar coverages at competitive prices within the markets that we operate.\nTrends in claims and coverage issues have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage emerge. These issues have adversely affect our business over the past few years and continue to impact us in ways that may not be fully clear at this time, by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued. An example of an existing trend, particularly in Florida homeowners insurance, is the assignment of benefits (\u201cAOB\u201d) for a claim where a service provider agrees to make a repair that may be covered by an insurance policy in exchange for the policyholder\u2019s right to sue the insurance carrier directly. The AOB phenomenon substantially increased, and may continue to increase, our exposure to inflated claims, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Although legislative actions in the State of Florida to limit the effect of AOB\non insurance companies were passed in 2019, the effect of such legislation has been a shift in the volume of lawsuits from third-party/AOB suits from third party contractors and vendors, to first party suits from our policyholders instead. Another recent trend has been increased litigation regarding construction defect claims against the insureds under our commercial general liability policies written in prior years in Florida. This recent trend has resulted in low severity, high frequency claims that, although typically excluded by our policy language, nevertheless generate a high volume of litigation and related defense costs. There can be no assurances that the 2019 AOB legislation or any other future legislative actions for broader tort or insurance reform will become law or, if enacted, that such actions will have the effect of limiting the impact on us of \u201csocial inflation\u201d and/or other causes of elevated levels of lawsuits.\nIf our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, instead of continuing our focus on our products or markets in Florida, our financial results may suffer.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are focusing our operations on the Florida market. Our ability to continue that focus will depend on our ability to support growth in the geographic markets in which we do business, balanced by the business risks we choose to assume and cede. Our existing sources of funds include issuance of equity or debt securities (although the incurrence of additional debt in certain circumstances would require the consent of existing debt holders), sales of our investment securities, and our earnings from operations and investments. Catastrophic events in our market areas, such as the hurricanes experienced in Florida, Louisiana and Texas in 2021, 2020 and 2019, and other catastrophic weather events, have resulted and may result in greater claims losses than anticipated, which could require us to restrict growth while we redeploy our capital to pay these unanticipated claims.\nThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nVarious provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which have been structured to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. At the present time, we employ a variety of exclusions to our policies that limit exposure to known risks, including, but not limited to, exclusions relating to certain named liabilities and specific artisan activities. In addition, the policies we issue contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While we believe our insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the loss exposure to us and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or that legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe failure of various risk mitigation strategies utilized could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or reputation in the marketplace.\nWe utilize a number of tactics to mitigate risk exposure within our insurance business, which include:\n\u2022Avoidance of risks that do not conform to underwriting standards;\n\u2022Risk portfolio optimization;\n\u2022Transferring portfolio risk to financially sound reinsurance companies;\n\u2022Acquiring adequate primary insurance to ensure continued operations; and\n\u2022Promoting an enterprise risk management culture.\nIf we fail to effectively mitigate our risk exposures, the Company could experience increased claims, losses from catastrophic events that are not reinsured and/or damage of our reputation that makes agents and reinsurers reluctant to work with us.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants in our senior note indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control such as a downgrade in our financial rating or a failure to renew excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indentures for our senior notes require us to maintain certain financial ratios and to comply with various operational and other covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratings and limitations on our ability to incur additional debt in certain circumstances without the approval of the existing noteholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, our debt is rated \u2018BBB.\u2019 If our rating were to decrease by two notches, to \u2018BB+,\u2019 the interest rate due on the senior notes would increase by 50 basis points and an additional 50 basis points for each additional notch below \u2018BB+'. The terms of our senior note indentures currently prevent us from incurring additional debt (above a stated amount of $10 million) as provided in the indentures, paying cash dividends or repurchasing our shares.\nIf there were an event of default under the indentures that was not cured or waived, the holders of the senior notes could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the senior notes to be due and payable immediately. A four notch decrease to our debt rating, to the level of BB-, would constitute such an event of default. If the Company is placed into receivership and/or fails to obtain excess-of-loss reinsurance, such conditions also represent potential defaults. We cannot assure our shareholders that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay the senior notes, if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the senior notes. This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of our recent losses, our net deferred tax asset, against which we established a valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2021, will not be recoverable if we do not achieve net income.\nBecause of our recent losses, we established a valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2021 against the entire amount of the net deferred tax asset we had been reflecting on our balance sheet as required by GAAP. We will be able to recover the net deferred tax asset over time if we achieve taxable income, as to which there can be no assurances. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations, including of our insurance subsidiaries under statutory accounting principles, may be adversely affected by the lack of tax offsets against operating losses until we achieve adequate levels of taxable income.\nOur business is heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we conduct business. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to shareholders and other investors, and relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurance company\u2019s business. Regulators may also exert influence over the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves we carry for future claims on the insurance policies we issue. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. State regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers\u2019 business practices. These reviews may reveal deficiencies in our insurance operations or differences between our interpretations of regulatory requirements and those of the regulators.\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators are constantly reexamining existing laws and regulations, generally focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws.\nFrom time to time, some states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. In other situations, states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that impact the competitive environment and marketplace for property and casualty insurance. In addition, in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in financial services regulation and federal taxation, can significantly impact the insurance industry and us.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the effect any enacted, proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the regulatory requirements applicable to our business will not become more stringent in the future or result in materially higher costs than current requirements. Changes in the regulation of our business may reduce our profitability, limit our growth or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nOur revenues and operating performance will fluctuate due to statutorily approved assessments that support property and casualty insurance pools and associations.\nWe operate in a regulatory environment where certain entities and organizations have the authority to require us to participate in assessments. Currently these entities and organizations include, but are not limited to, the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cFIGA\u201d), Citizens, the FHCF, Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (\u201cTWIA\u201d) and Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance (\u201cLCPI\u201d).\nInsurance companies currently pass these assessments on to holders of insurance policies in the form of a policy surcharge and reflect the collection of these assessments as fully earned credits to operations in the period collected. The collection of these fees, however, may adversely affect our overall marketing strategy due to the competitive landscape in Florida. As a result, the impact of possible future assessments on our balance sheet, results of operations or cash flow are indeterminable at this time.\nOur operations, financial condition and results could be adversely affected by COVID-19 and other future contagious severe health viruses.\nWe are exposed to the risk of natural or man-made events, such as COVID-19 or other pandemics that could cause substantial deaths, illnesses and business disruptions. We continue to closely monitor developments related to COVID-19 and its variants to assess any potential future impact on our business, which continues to be an evolving and highly uncertain situation. As a means of limiting the exposure of FNHC\u2019s team to the spread of infectious diseases, the Company has long supported a work-from-home culture in response to business continuity concerns by establishing and supporting the expansion of the Company\u2019s network infrastructure to include dedicated home workstations for most employees. Nevertheless, material disruptions to the Company caused by the pandemic could include:\n\u2022Although we believe that our product offerings and contractual coverages limit our exposure to claims related to COVID-19, there may be a risk that legislative, regulatory, judicial or social influences could extend coverage beyond our contractual obligations or may result in an increase in the frequency or severity of claims beyond expected levels.\n\u2022Volatile and illiquid global financial markets resulting from the outbreak may adversely impact the fair value or credit quality of securities in our investment portfolio.\n\u2022Reduced liquidity, higher operating costs and strained profitability from legislative, regulatory or judicial actions may result in denials of rate increases, including rate increases we have already implemented, require premium payment grace periods, or prevent cancellations for non-payment of premium.\n\u2022A decline in demand for our product offerings or declining ability or willingness of our policy holders to pay premiums may reduce our revenues.\n\u2022We may require additional liquidity at a time when our cost of capital increases and/or access to capital is hampered.\n\u2022Social distancing impedes observing certain claims on-site and, in some cases, may adversely impact our ability to properly assess certain claims.\n\u2022The economic effects adversely impacting the liquidity and financial stability of our reinsurers may cause an increase in our reinsurance costs and/or counterparty risk with resulting write-offs of reinsurance recoverables.\n\u2022Market volatility and declining economic conditions adversely impacting the liquidity and financial stability of the issuers of securities we hold may result in realized losses.\n\u2022Our ability to maintain relationships with key vendors, and those vendors\u2019 willingness or ability to perform services for us as expected, may be adversely impacted.\n\u2022We may experience cyber security losses due to our employees working remotely.\nAdditional localized or widespread events resulting from COVID-19 or its variants, or other infectious diseases that directly affect our workplace, insureds or reinsurers could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our ability to effectively conduct business, including our ability to write new business, and our financial condition. Therefore, additional prolonged periods of commercial disruption, reduced economic activity, high unemployment, extreme market volatility, disruptions to capital and credit markets, and other consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, its variants or other infectious diseases could have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results.\nOur investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns, or losses, which would significantly reduce our earnings.\nLike other insurance companies, we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a portion of our earnings. During the time that normally elapses between the receipt of insurance premiums and any payment of insurance claims, we invest the premiums received, together with our other available capital, primarily in debt securities and to a lesser extent in equity securities, in order to generate investment income.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of interest rate sensitive instruments, such as bonds, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. A significant increase in interest rates or decrease in credit worthiness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Declines in interest rates, such as occurred during 2020, could have an adverse effect on our investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, unrealized losses will arise on our investment portfolio. Further, if periods of net cash outflows arise, whether due to catastrophe losses or for other reasons, we may need to draw down our bond\nportfolio, reducing the interest income we will earn in future periods and converting unrealized losses to realized losses, which impact the statutory surplus of our insurance carriers.\nIn addition, volatile and illiquid markets increase the likelihood that investment securities may not behave in historically predictable manners, resulting in fair value estimates that may be overstated compared with actual amounts that could be realized upon disposition or maturity of the security. The effects of market volatility, declining economic conditions, such as a US or global economic slowdown, whether due to coronavirus, or other factors, could adversely impact the fair value or credit quality of securities in our portfolio and may have unforeseen consequences on the liquidity and financial stability of the issuers of securities we hold. Such deteriorations in financial condition can occur rapidly, leaving us unable to react to such a scenario in a prudent manner consistent with our historical practices in dealing with more orderly markets. This, in turn, could adversely and negatively affect our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nOur failure to pay claims accurately could adversely affect our business, financial results and capital requirements.\nWe must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, the culture of our claims organization and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to pay claims accurately could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\nIn addition, if we are not able to handle an increasing number of claims as a result of a catastrophic event, or if we do not train new claims adjusting employees effectively or lose a significant number of experienced claims adjusting employees, our claims department\u2019s ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, we could suffer decreased quality of claims work, which in turn could lower our operating margins.\nFurther, FNU has entered into a Claims Services Agreement with SageSure, effective February 1, 2022, wherein SageSure will provide claims adjusting and other claims-related services with respect to claims made under insurance policies issued by FNIC that were placed by SageSure. The personnel adjusting these claims will be adjusters employed by, or contracted with, SageSure and we are relying on SageSure to ensure that such personnel are trained and supervised appropriately. If such personnel are unable to adjust assigned claims in a timely manner in accordance with our guidelines, this could adversely affect our ability to pay and settle claims accurately, resulting in material litigation and negatively impacting our financial results.\nOur revenues and operating performance may fluctuate with business cycles in the property and casualty insurance industry.\nHistorically, the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical patterns characterized by periods of significant competition in pricing and underwriting terms and conditions, which is known as a \u201csoft\u201d insurance market, followed by periods of lessened competition and increasing premium rates, which is known as a \u201chard\u201d insurance market. Although an individual insurance company\u2019s financial performance is dependent upon its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern, with profitability generally increasing in hard markets and decreasing in soft markets. At present, on a consolidated basis, we continue to file and obtain rate increases as the current Florida property and casualty market continues to harden. We cannot predict how long these market conditions will persist. Although we do not compete entirely on price or targeted market share, negative market conditions may impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot write insurance at appropriate rates, our revenues and operating performance may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to accurately price the risks we underwrite.\nThe results of operations and the financial condition of our insurance companies depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, LAE and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and price our products accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data;\n\u2022the uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022our selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques;\n\u2022changes in legal standards, claim settlement practices, medical care expenses and restoration costs;\n\u2022regulatory restrictions, including, without limitation regulatory approval of rates sought; and\n\u2022legislatively imposed consumer initiatives.\nConsequently, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness. In either event, the profitability of our insurance companies could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on independent and general agents to write our insurance policies, and if we are not able to attract and retain independent and general agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\nWe currently market and distribute our products and services through contractual relationships with a network of independent agents and a select number of general agents. Our independent agents are our primary source for our property and liability insurance policies. Many of our competitors also rely on independent agents. As a result, we must compete with other insurers for independent agents\u2019 business. Our competitors may offer a greater variety of insurance products, lower premiums for insurance coverage, or higher commissions to their agents. If our products, pricing and commissions do not remain competitive, we may find it more difficult to attract business from independent agents to sell our products. A material reduction in the amount of our products that independent agents sell or a material reduction in the number of independent agents with whom we maintain a relationship could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a party to an insurance agency master agreement with ISA, an affiliate of Allstate, pursuant to which we are authorized by ISA to appoint Allstate agents to offer our homeowners insurance products to consumers in Florida. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 19.3%, 20.7% and 23.2%, respectively, of the homeowners premiums we underwrote were from Allstate\u2019s network of Florida agents. This concentration may increase further. An interruption or change in our relationship with ISA could have a material adverse effect on the amount of premiums we are able to write, as well as our results of operations.\nWe are a party to a managing general underwriting agreement with SageSure to manage our FNIC homeowners business outside of Florida. As a percentage of our total homeowners premiums, 24.6%, 25.5% and 23.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were underwritten by SageSure. As discussed elsewhere in the Form 10-K, the Company is in the process of running off the book of business managed by SageSure. An interruption in SageSure\u2019s services for us, or issues with the quality thereof, could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the business obtained through this relationship.\nSome agreements with agents provide that the renewal rights for policies written under those agreements belong to the agents, making it more difficult for us to maintain the policies written and the premium income generated through these relationships.\nOur agreements with ISA and SageSure provide that ISA and SageSure, respectively, own the expirations of the policies underwritten under these agreements. This means that we do not have the right to solicit renewals of these policies. As a result, we may be less able to maintain the policies and the corresponding premium income from renewals of policies written by us under these agreements.\nCybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to loss of data or liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our insureds and employees, on our networks. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. We have also promoted the ability of our team to work remotely, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic, which could make our systems more vulnerable to breaches. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims against us, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations, and damage our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Although we have implemented security measures to protect our systems from viruses and other intrusions by third parties, there can be no assurances that these measures will be effective. To mitigate these costs, we carry a cyber-liability insurance policy. Our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all financial and other loss. Additionally, this policy will not cover us for security breaches, data loss, or cyber-attacks experienced by our third-party business partners who have access to our customer, agent, or employee data.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving the systems of one or more of our business partners or vendors.\nWe conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party business partners and vendors, who provide software, hosting, communication, and other computer services to us. Our networks could be compromised by the errors or actions of our vendors and other business partners with legitimate access to our systems. If one of our vendors or other business partners are the subject of a security breach or cyber-attack, such breach or attack may result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems, and the loss, theft or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers, agents or employees, notwithstanding our substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. An unauthorized disclosure or loss of policyholder or employee information or other sensitive or confidential information, including by cyber-attack or other security breach, could cause a loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. While we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and the failure of these systems could disrupt our operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our current information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations, as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development. As a result, the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nIncreased competition, competitive pressures, industry developments and market conditions could affect the growth of our business and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies in the homeowners markets, many of whom are larger, have greater financial and other resources, have higher financial strength ratings and offer more diversified insurance coverage. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents, as well as companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. One particular competitor to note is Citizens, which is a quasi-governmental entity within the State of Florida. Citizens is designed to operate as a market of last resort, and is subject to limitations on how much it can raise its rates in any one year. Citizens has emerged in recent years as a significant competitor with rates that are now often cheaper than the private carriers, including our Company. Citizens is currently growing rapidly and is expected to do so for the foreseeable future, which limits our ability to write and retain business that may be profitable for our Company. Also, large national captive writers may have certain competitive advantages over independent agency writers, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs. We may be forced to reduce our premiums or increase our commissions significantly to compete, which could make us less profitable and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not meet the prices offered by our competitors, we may lose business in the short term, which could also result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur executive management team is critical to the strategic direction of our company. If there were an unplanned loss of service by any of our officers our business could be harmed.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend, on the services of our executive management team, which includes Michael H. Braun, Chief Executive Officer and President, and others. Our success also will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If we were to lose the services of one or more members of our executive management team, our business could be adversely affected. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, any unplanned loss of service could substantially harm our business.\nOur reliance on insurance scoring in pricing and underwriting certain of our insurance policies may be limited by changes in applicable law, regulation or policies of regulatory authorities, which could cause our pricing and underwriting to be less effective.\nWe rely on insurance scoring, which combines credit scores and claims history of persons applying for insurance policies with us, in pricing and underwriting these policies. We believe that the use of this information, together with other relevant information provided to us in the application process, is important to our ability to effectively price our insurance products and determine the risks we are willing to underwrite. We also believe that we use this information in accordance with applicable law, regulations and policies. From time to time, however, the use of this information has come under review by insurance and other regulators. If the use of this information is limited or prohibited, our pricing and underwriting of our insurance policies may be less effective, with the result that our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Shares\nOur stock price in recent years has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile. As a result, the market price of our common stock may drop below the price you pay, and you may not be able to resell your shares at a profit.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility from time to time. Such volatility may be affected by various factors and events, such as:\n\u2022our operating results, including a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022recognition of large unanticipated accounting charges, such as related to a loss reserve strengthening;\n\u2022changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally;\n\u2022a downgrade of our Demotech rating or the rating of our outstanding debt;\n\u2022the announcement of a material event or anticipated event involving us or our industry or the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022the issuance of a significant number of shares; and\n\u2022the other risk factors described in this Annual Report, the accompanying notes and the documents incorporated by reference herein.\nIn recent years, the U.S. stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have sometimes affected the market price of the securities issued by a particular company in a manner unrelated to the operational performance of the Company. This type of market effect could impact our common stock price as well. The volatility of our common stock means that the price of our common stock may have declined substantially at such time as you may look to sell your shares of our common stock. If our share price decreases, the value of your investment could decline.\nOur failure to continue to meet Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards, including its newly adopted board diversity rule, could have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nOur shares are currently listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market. Remaining listed for trading on Nasdaq requires us to remain compliant with Nasdaq\u2019s current continued listing requirements, which include maintaining minimum levels of shareholders\u2019 equity, assets and revenues (depending on the compliance standard being used to demonstrate compliance), and other quantitative standards such as minimum market value of publicly held shares, $1.00 minimum closing bid price, and number of market makers. In addition, Nasdaq requires Nasdaq-listed companies to disclose board-level diversity statistics using a standard matrix beginning with the 2022 proxy statement, and to have or explain why they do not have at least two diverse directors beginning August 7, 2023. Although we currently meet the Nasdaq continued listing requirements, there can be no assurances that we will continue to do so in the future.\nWe have authorized but unissued preferred stock, which could affect rights of holders of common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be issued as a method of discouraging a takeover attempt. Although we do not intend to issue any preferred stock at this time, we may do so in the future.\nAs a holding company, we depend on the earnings of our subsidiaries (particularly our non-regulated subsidiaries) and their ability to pay management fees and dividends to the holding company as the primary source of our income.\nWe are an insurance holding company whose primary assets are our subsidiaries. Our operations, and our ability to pay dividends or service our debt, are limited by the earnings of our subsidiaries and their payment of their earnings to us in the form of management fees, commissions, dividends, loans, advances or the reimbursement of expenses. These payments can be made only when our subsidiaries have adequate earnings. In addition, dividend payments made to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable state laws governing our insurance subsidiaries. Generally, these laws limit the dividends permitted to be paid by insurance companies under complicated formulas based on the companies\u2019 available capital and earnings. Our insurance subsidiaries have not paid any dividends to the holding company in over five years and we do not anticipate any such payments from our insurance carriers in the foreseeable future.\nPayment of dividends from our non-insurance subsidiaries to the holding company in the future will depend upon the earnings and financial position of our non-regulated subsidiaries and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.\nAs described earlier in these risk factors, the Company has concluded there is substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law provide for anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders in the public market, or the possibility or perception of such future sales, or sales of additional shares of common stock by us, could depress our stock price.\nInvestors currently known to be the beneficial owners of more than 5.0% of our common stock hold approximately 40% of our outstanding shares. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise by our existing shareholders, or the possibility or perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. In addition, we may issue additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the future in amounts that may be significant. The sale of substantial amounts of our common stock by us, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely impact our stock price.
