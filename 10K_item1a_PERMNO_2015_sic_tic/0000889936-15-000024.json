RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our securities. The risks discussed below are those that we believe are the most significant risks affecting us and our business, although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. Before making a decision to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, many of which include larger credit relationships. The repayment of commercial loans is largely dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower and the state of the economy.\nOur commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which includes owner-occupied commercial real estate, totaled $7.9 billion, or 66% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2014, compared to $7.1 billion, or 67% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2013. The repayment of the loans in our commercial and industrial portfolio is largely dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower.\nMany of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by different types of collateral related to the underlying business, such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and, in the case of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, by the real estate property, all or any of which often fluctuate in value, and which may result in the loan being temporarily under-collateralized. If we foreclose on underlying collateral in the event of default of any such loan, we may not be able to recover the full principal amount of the loan as the unique nature of certain collateral may make it difficult and costly to liquidate.\nHigher-risk commercial and industrial loans are primarily underwritten on the recurring earnings of the borrower, where the ratio of debt to earnings is elevated compared to other commercial loans that are not characterized as higher-risk. These metrics were defined by the FDIC in late 2012. Our higher-risk commercial and industrial loans are spread across multiple industries, generally command higher loan yields as a premium for underwriting the additional risk due to their leveraged position, and typically have lower collateral coverage than similar commercial and industrial loans that are not classified as higher-risk. As a result, in the event of default, the loss potential may be greater for these types of loans versus similar commercial and industrial loans that are not classified as higher-risk.\nMany of our commercial and industrial loans involve larger relationships. At December 31, 2014, we had credit commitments of $25 million or more totaling $4.3 billion. Of this total commitment at December 31, 2014, we had $2.3 billion in loans outstanding, or 19% of our loan portfolio, in amounts in excess of $25 million. Some of these borrowers may be related to other obligors as guarantors or share related ownership structures. Approximately 88% of these large credits are commercial and industrial businesses; the remaining exposure relates primarily to commercial real estate loans. Of our largest commitments, commitments of $50 million or more represented $339.0 million in total commitments at December 31, 2014, compared to $302.8 million in total commitments at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014, $71.1 million of these largest commitments was outstanding, compared to $15.9 million at December 31, 2013. These credits, as well as larger credit relationships, are subject to increased scrutiny in our credit approval process. Depending on collateral values, success of a workout strategy or the ability of a borrower to return to performing status, the unexpected occurrence of an event or development adversely impacting one or more of our large clients could materially affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nThe largest industry segment concentration within our commercial lending business is the healthcare industry. We have a specialized niche in the nursing and residential care segment of the healthcare industry. At December 31, 2014, 23% of the commercial loan portfolio, or $1.8 billion, was composed of loans within the healthcare industry, primarily loans in which the healthcare facilities securing the loans are dependent, in part, on the receipt of payments and reimbursements under government contracts for services provided. Accordingly, our clients and their ability to service debt may be adversely impacted by the financial health of state or federal payors and the ability of governmental entities, many of which have experienced budgetary stress in the recent economic environment, to make payments for services previously provided. As of December 31, 2014, 61% of the healthcare portfolio was secured by facilities in five states, with Illinois representing the highest percentage of facilities at 18%.\nThe success of our business is dependent on ongoing access to sufficient and cost-effective sources of liquidity.\nWe depend on access to a variety of funding sources to provide sufficient liquidity to support our loan growth strategy, and accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients, including client draws on unused lines of credit and other business needs. Our total unfunded commitments to extend credit, including obligations to issue letters of credit, grew to $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2014 from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2013. It is difficult to predict when clients may draw on such commitments and, given the large size of many of our lending relationships, the impact such draws may have on our liquidity needs. If we experience draws on unfunded commitments and other loan growth in amounts significantly greater than our expectations, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our balance sheet on a cost-effective basis.\nCurrently, our primary sources of funding are deposits, the majority from commercial clients and large institutional accounts, and Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings. Our deposit base is relatively concentrated in large relationships, with our ten largest deposit relationships comprising 17% of total deposits at December 31, 2014. At year end 2014, we had 22 client relationships with greater than $75 million in deposit balances that totaled $3.3 billion, or 25% of total deposits. The unanticipated loss of one or more large relationships, or significant movements in large deposit accounts, could stress our liquidity. If our primary sources of liquidity are insufficient, we may need to rely on contingent funding sources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, depending on the eligibility of our collateral, market conditions and other factors, and this would have a negative impact on our profitability.\nAlso, the federal banking agencies have proposed new liquidity standards that could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business lines by forcing us to seek new sources of liquidity, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. As part of the Basel III capital process, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a new liquidity standard, a liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), which requires a banking organization to hold sufficient \"high quality liquid assets\" to maintain adequate liquid assets to meet potential funding needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. Although the proposal will not apply directly to us because we have less than $50 billion in assets, the substance of the proposal may inform the regulators' assessment of our liquidity, and may cause secondary impact in the markets in which we actively participate as well as the competitive environment, including the pricing for deposits, in which we operate. We could be required to reduce our holdings of illiquid assets and increase our level of core deposits, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and could have an adverse effect on our growth.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan we make carries a certain risk of non-payment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe credit risks posed by the particular borrower and loan type;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the loan;\n\u2022\nin the case of a collateralized loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to identify potential repayment issues in loans at an early stage.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time. The allowance is not a prediction of our actual credit losses going forward. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified, which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio and management's judgment. In calculating the allowance, we use historical default and loss information and a great deal of judgment, including with respect to the state of the overall economy, the strength of the commercial real estate market, and negative events or circumstances that might impact an individual borrower. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur losses on loans greater than what we have provided for in the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $152.5 million at December 31, 2014, compared to $143.1 million at December 31, 2013. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.28% at December 31, 2014, compared to 1.34% at December 31, 2013. Our allowance as a percentage of total loans reflects a level based on management's analysis of the risk inherent in our loan portfolio. Although we believe our loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date, the allowance may not be adequate especially if economic conditions worsen or the factors\nused to calculate the allowance change. Also, proposed changes in accounting principles related to the calculation/determination of the allowance could result in a required increase.\nIn the event we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our credit losses exceed our allowance or we are required to take higher than anticipated charge-offs in future periods, our earnings and our capital will be adversely affected. Given that approximately 20% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2014 was comprised of credit relationships in amounts in excess of $25 million, we may experience variability in our quarterly loan loss provision expense and charge-offs if larger or leveraged credits default, which may impact credit quality trends.\nWe may be adversely affected by interest rate changes or an extended period of continued low interest rates.\nOur operating results are largely dependent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on earning assets, usually loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. The spread between the yield on our interest-earning assets and our overall cost of funds has been compressed in the recent low interest rate environment, and our net interest income may be adversely impacted by an extended period of continued low rates. Interest rates are affected by factors including: monetary policy of the FRB, actual inflation or deflation or expectations regarding the same, actual or forecasted economic growth or contractions, unemployment rates, domestic and foreign events, and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. The timing of any FRB action to curtail or eliminate various stimulus-related programs, as a result of inflation concerns or otherwise, could have an impact on interest rates in general and our net interest margin in particular. While the yield on our loan portfolio is primarily variable and based on short-term rates and would therefore adjust quickly to a rise in interest rates, the impact on our cost of funds from a rise in interest rates will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: the competitive environment in the banking sector for deposit pricing, opportunities for clients to invest in other markets such as fixed income and equity markets, and the propensity of customers to invest in their businesses. The effect on our net interest income from an increase in interest rates will ultimately depend on the extent to which the aggregate impact of loan re-pricings exceeds the impact of increases in our cost of funds. Moreover, depending on the level and trend of the aforementioned factors, our cost of funds could increase more rapidly than foreseen and the level of change in cost of funds may even exceed the increase in yield in our loan portfolios.\nOur investment portfolio also contains interest rate sensitive instruments and the market value of these instruments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, domestic and international economic and political conditions, issuer or insurer credit deterioration and market factors. A rise in interest rates or spread widening would reduce the net unrealized gains that we had in our investment portfolio at the end of 2014.\nWe will become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity and constrain our growth.\nIn July 2013, each of the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules implementing the recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to strengthen the regulatory capital requirements of all banking organizations in the United States. The new capital framework, referred to as Basel III, substantially revises the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including PrivateBancorp and the Bank, compared to current U.S. risk-based rules. The final Basel III rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 and will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.\nBasel III creates a new regulatory capital standard based on Tier 1 common equity and increases the minimum leverage and risk-based capital ratios applicable to all banking organizations. Basel III also changes how a number of the regulatory capital components are calculated. Any significant increase in our capital requirements could reduce our growth and profitability and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For more information about the regulations to which we are subject, see the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nOur business could be significantly impacted if we, or our third party service providers, suffer failure, cyber-attack or disruptions of information systems or if our employees cause an operational infrastructure breakdown or failure.\nWe rely heavily on communications, data processing and other information processing systems to conduct our business and support our business, many of which are provided through third-parties. If our third party providers encounter difficulties or become the source of an attack on or breach of their operational systems, data or infrastructure, or if we have difficulty communicating with any such third party system, our business operations could suffer. Any failure or disruption to our systems, or those of a third party provider, could impede our transaction processing, service delivery, customer relationship management, data processing, financial reporting or risk management. Although we take ongoing protective monitoring, detection, and prevention measures and perform penetration testing and risk assessments at least annually, our computer systems, software and networks, and those of our third\nparty providers, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious code, or cyber-attacks beyond what we can reasonably anticipate and such events could result in material loss. Additionally, we could suffer disruptions to our systems or damage to our network infrastructure from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and protective measures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach, or the policies, procedures and protective measures of our third party providers, will be effective. If significant failure, interruption or security breaches do occur in our processing systems or those of our third party providers, we could suffer significant damage to our reputation, a loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny, or exposure to civil litigation, additional costs and possible financial liability. In addition, our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor, on a continuous basis, a large number of transactions. To do so, we are dependent on our employees and therefore, the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization, including losses resulting from human error. We could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our employees cause a significant operational breakdown or failure. If we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure, systems, controls and personnel relative to our size and products and services, our ability to effectively operate our business may be impaired and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe loss of key managing directors may adversely affect our business.\nWe are a relationship-driven organization. Our continued growth and development is dependent in large part upon the efforts of our managing directors who have primary contact with our clients and have responsibility for maintaining personalized relationships with our client base. These personalized relationships are a key aspect of our business strategy. The loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business if we are unable to hire suitable replacements or we are unable to successfully retain the client relationships of a departing managing director.\nWe have counterparty risk; the creditworthiness of other financial institutions could expose us to losses on contracts we have with these institutions and could adversely affect our ability to provide services to our clients, specifically products and services relating to foreign exchange, derivatives and letters of credit.\nOur ability to provide certain products and services could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other banks. Banks are interrelated as a result of lending, clearing, correspondent, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more banks, or the banking industry generally, have in the past led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of the transactions engaged in by us in the ordinary course of business, particularly in our capital markets group, expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or customer. In such instances, the collateral we hold may be insufficient to mitigate our losses, as we may be unable to realize or liquidate at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure. Such losses could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur capital markets group offers to clients a range of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives products. Although we do not engage in any proprietary trading and we structure these client-generated trading activities to mitigate our exposure to market risk, we remain exposed to various risks, the most significant of which include credit risk of our counterparties, operational risk and settlement risk, which may be most significant in foreign exchange transactions where timing differences between settlement centers can result in us paying our client and/or counterparty before actually receiving the funds. In addition, for swaps we execute with counterparties to mitigate the market risk of our customer trades, we may be required to post collateral to secure our obligations related to those trades; if such a counterparty invokes the protection of insolvency laws, then the collateral posted to secure our obligations to that counterparty may be trapped with, and potentially subject to claims of creditors of, that counterparty. The risk exposure to our counterparties requires active monitoring as well as liquidity management to ensure timely and cost efficient posting of collateral. Operational risk includes errors in execution of internal bank procedures and controls, which could expose us to financial risk and/or reputation loss. A lapse or breakdown of these procedures or controls could significantly increase our exposure to counterparty credit risk and operational risk, which could result in a material loss to us.\nA prolonged period of economic uncertainty or worsening of current economic conditions, in the U.S. or globally, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBanking, and the financial industry in general, is reliant on the strength of the broader economy. Although the economy has been improving recently, the U.S. economy remains susceptible to a sluggish labor market, limited GDP growth, low inflation and housing price volatility, as well as uncertainty related to U.S. and European fiscal issues, political climates and global economic conditions. Economic uncertainty, sustained high unemployment, volatility or disruptions of global financial markets, or prolonged deterioration in the global, national or local business or economic conditions could result in, among other things, a deterioration\nof credit quality, impairment of real estate values or a reduced demand for credit or other products and services we offer to clients. In addition, the financial condition of the State of Illinois where we do the majority of our business (higher corporate tax rates, significant budget deficits and a deteriorating credit rating) may contribute to an adverse climate for doing business in the state which could negatively impact us to the extent it leads to declines in business activity in Illinois. Although we do not hold direct obligations of the State of Illinois, such conditions can also negatively affect the market value of those municipal bonds that are obligations of municipalities domiciled in Illinois.\nAn increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults in future periods by our borrowers due to any of the factors above, or otherwise, could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for loan and covered asset losses, and valuation adjustments on any loans held for sale, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, and the shape of the yield curve.\nDuring the last few years, the Federal Reserve has been involved in a series of domestic monetary policy initiatives in response to economic conditions, including the purchase of U.S. treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities commonly known as \u201cquantitative easing\u201d (\u201cQE\u201d). Among other things, quantitative easing strategies were intended to create or maintain a low interest rate environment and to stimulate economic activity, and have theoretically caused interest rates to be lower than they would have been without such involvement. The Federal Reserve has been gradually tapering off the program since mid-2013, and formally ended the program during the fourth quarter of 2014. The impact of the end of QE is a source of ongoing uncertainty because its absence may have an impact on the level and direction of interest rates should the economy encounter headwinds. Interest rate volatility impacts the level and cost of deposits and liquidity levels in the financial system in general and the banking system in particular, which may disrupt financial markets and could adversely impact the level and cost of our deposits, the value of our investment securities portfolio or general economic conditions. In addition, we expect there will continue to be significant competition for deposits which may also impact our cost of deposits. A sharp movement up or down in interest rates could have a significant, adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe are highly regulated and may be adversely affected by changes in banking laws, regulations, and regulatory practices.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination. This regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer credit, fair lending, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), but also capital adequacy, asset quality, risk management, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. Under this structure the regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine, among other things, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or regulations or are otherwise inconsistent with regulatory expectations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations. As described above in \u201cSupervision and Regulation,\u201d the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and recently adopted regulations have significantly changed the overall bank regulatory framework with increased capital and liquidity requirements, heightened risk management expectations, and new consumer protection standards. Any failure on our part to comply with laws, regulations, and other regulatory requirements applicable to us or expectations of our regulators relating to compliance or safe and sound banking practices could result in regulatory sanctions, civil money penalties or adverse actions against us, which in turn could increase our compliance burden and costs of doing business, restrict our ability to expand our business or result in damage to our reputation.\nChanges in laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting the financial services industry, and the effects of such changes, are difficult to predict and may have unintended consequences. New regulations or changes in the regulatory environment could limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. We may incur increased costs related to additional staffing, professional services and information technology resources to support compliance or data collection and data analytics to satisfy evolving expectations for enhanced risk and liquidity management processes and new regulatory reporting requirements.\nFollowing the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act, banks have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny including compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations; failure to satisfy regulatory expectations may subject us to supervisory enforcement actions.\nBank regulatory authorities have substantial supervisory and enforcement authority to address compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer credit, fair lending, privacy, information security and anti-\nmoney laundering and anti-terrorism laws). The creation of the CFPB under the Dodd-Frank Act has generally led to heightened scrutiny by banking regulators of financial institutions' compliance with consumer lending laws and consumer financial regulations, particularly with respect to \"unfair, deceptive or abusive\" acts and practices as well as alleged fair lending violations based on claims of disparate treatment or disparate impact on minority groups in connection with consumer lending activities, and the CFPB has imposed significant fines and penalties on certain organizations in this regard. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or new consumer protection standards applicable to us or the expectations of our regulators relating to compliance practices could result in regulatory sanctions, civil money penalties or adverse actions against us, which in turn could increase our compliance burden and costs of doing business, restrict our ability to expand our business or result in significant damage to our reputation.\nWhile we have consistently supported our communities through community development lending in low and moderate income areas across our assessment areas, through investments in affordable housing initiatives including affordable home loans, through financial contributions to community groups and through significant volunteer service by our employees and management teams, our residential lending volume in certain communities during 2010 through 2012 was lower than expectations. In response, we have created a dedicated community lending team and have invested in expanded marketing and advertising to strengthen our mortgage lending outreach to underserved borrowers and communities across our market areas. As a result of these efforts, we have improved our direct residential mortgage lending activity in the targeted markets and we continue to focus on enhancing our community lending efforts and fair lending compliance programs. We do not anticipate that the costs of our actions to address these issues will be material to our financial results. While we are committed to maintaining effective compliance programs that satisfy regulatory expectations, based on our discussions with our regulators, we understand that they are considering supervisory enforcement action, including potential civil money penalties, in light of past lending activity. Although not material to the execution of our current business plans or organic growth strategy, we would need to resolve these regulatory concerns before pursuing mergers or acquisitions or other expansion that requires prior regulatory approval.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this environment. We compete for commercial business with many banks that are substantially larger than we are and, in some cases, we may have a competitive disadvantage due to their greater resources, broader product offerings and economies of scale. In the recent period of competitive loan demand and persistently low interest rates, we have experienced significant competitive pressure in pricing and structuring loans in certain of our loan segments. Because we generate earnings primarily from the difference between the interest earned on loans and the interest we pay to depositors, this pricing pressure has impacted our margins.\nRemaining competitive will require ongoing investments in technology and infrastructure to enhance service delivery, support new products and services and continue to grow our business in the current regulatory environment. These investments are directed at adapting existing products and services to evolving technology and the demands of our clients. Falling behind our competitors, who may have more extensive resources to invest, in any of these areas, could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 87020, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PVTB"}
