{"cik": "278130", "company": "PIER 1 IMPORTS INC/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to risk. The following discussion, along with Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, sets forth the most significant risks and uncertainties that management believes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. There is no assurance that this discussion covers all potential risks that may be faced by the Company. The occurrence of the described risks could cause the Company\u2019s results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements included elsewhere in this report, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nStrategic Risks and Strategy Execution Risks\nThe Company must be able to anticipate, identify and respond to changing trends and customer preferences for home d\u00e9cor and furniture.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s specialty retail business depends largely upon its ability to predict trends consistently and to provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand in a timely manner. Consumer preferences often change and may not be reasonably predicted. A majority of the Company\u2019s merchandise is manufactured, purchased and imported from countries around the world and may be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season. Extended lead times may make it difficult to respond rapidly to changes in consumer demand, and as a result, the Company may be unable to react quickly and source needed merchandise. In addition, the Company\u2019s vendors may not have the ability to handle its increased demand for product or speed of replenishment. The seasonal nature of the business leads the Company to purchase and requires it to carry a significant amount of inventory prior to its peak selling season. As a result, the Company may be vulnerable to evolving home furnishing trends, changes in customer preferences, and pricing shifts, and may misjudge the timing and selection of merchandise purchases. The Company\u2019s failure to anticipate, predict and respond in a timely manner to changing trends could lead to lower sales and additional discounts and markdowns in an effort to clear merchandise, which could have a negative impact on merchandise margin and, in turn, the results of operations.\nFailure by the Company to identify, develop and successfully implement strategic initiatives could have a negative impact on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s strategies for long-term growth, strategic plans and capital allocation are dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to identify and successfully implement those initiatives. If they are not properly identified, developed and successfully executed, the implementation of such initiatives may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business operations and financial results. While the Company believes these disruptions would be short-term, their adverse impact could be material.\nThe Company outsources certain business processes to third-party vendors and has certain business relationships that subject the Company to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nThe Company outsources numerous business processes to third parties including gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, store schedule visibility and time/attendance tracking, store maintenance services, maintenance and support of the Company\u2019s website and e-Commerce platform, certain marketing services, insurance claims processing, customs filings and reporting, domestic and ocean freight including certain processing functions, shipment and delivery of customer orders including in-home delivery, certain merchandise compliance functions including testing, certain payroll processing and various tax filings, record keeping for certain employment benefits including retirement plans and the stock purchase plan, and third party vendor auditing. In addition, the Company also has business relationships with third parties to provide essential services such as the extension of credit to its customers and maintenance of the Pier 1 rewards credit card program. The Company makes a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of these services are observing proper internal control and business continuity practices, such as redundant processing facilities; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services or the Company\u2019s inability to arrange for alternative providers on favorable terms in a timely manner could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nPIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. \u00ef 2016 Form 10-K 7\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn overall decline in the health of the economy in the United States or Canada and its impact on consumer confidence and spending could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe recessions experienced by the United States in various years adversely affected the discretionary spending, savings and investments of consumers. The resulting deterioration in consumer confidence and spending during those recessionary periods resulted in consumers reducing or eliminating their purchases of discretionary items, including the Company\u2019s merchandise, which negatively impacted the Company\u2019s financial results during those years. Such recessions could occur again and could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nFailure to control merchandise returns could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe Company has established a provision for estimated merchandise returns based upon historical experience and other known factors. If actual returns are greater than those projected by management, additional reductions of revenue could be recorded in the future. Also, to the extent that returned merchandise is damaged, the Company may not receive full retail value from the resale of the returned merchandise. Introductions of new merchandise, changes in merchandise mix, associate selling behavior, merchandise quality issues, changes to the Company\u2019s return policy, e-Commerce return behavior, changes in consumer confidence, new delivery channels/methods, recalls or other competitive and general economic conditions may cause actual returns to exceed the provision for estimated merchandise returns. An increase in merchandise returns that exceeds the Company\u2019s current provisions could negatively impact the business and financial results.\nA disruption in the operation of the domestic portion of the Company\u2019s supply chain, or the e-Commerce website, could impact the Company\u2019s ability to deliver merchandise to its stores and customers, which could impact its sales and results of operations.\nThe Company maintains regional distribution centers in Maryland, Ohio, Texas, California, Georgia and Washington. At these distribution centers, merchandise is received, allocated, and shipped to the Company\u2019s stores and customers, and at the Company\u2019s fulfillment centers in Ohio and Texas, e-Commerce orders are fulfilled. Major catastrophic events such as natural disasters, fire or flooding, malfunction or disruption of the information systems, a disruption in communication services or power outages, or shipping interruptions (including labor issues at the ports) could delay distribution of merchandise to the Company\u2019s stores and customers. Such disruptions could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s sales and results of operations.\nFailure to successfully manage and execute the Company\u2019s marketing initiatives could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe success and growth of the Company is dependent upon retaining existing customers and acquiring new customers to generate increased traffic in order to produce sales in its stores and through the Company\u2019s e-Commerce website. Successful marketing efforts require the ability to obtain customer information and to reach customers through their desired mode of communication utilizing various media outlets. Media placement decisions are generally made months in advance of the scheduled release date. While gathering information about customers, the Company must consider the customers\u2019 desire for privacy and the need to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Any future changes in privacy laws or their interpretation or enforcement by courts and governmental agencies could adversely impact our ability to market to customers. The Company\u2019s inability to obtain and use customer information, accurately predict and respect its customers\u2019 preferences, utilize the desired modes of communication, or ensure availability of advertised products may negatively impact the business and operating results.\nChanges to estimates related to the Company\u2019s property and equipment, or financial results that are lower than its current estimates at certain store locations and determinations to close underperforming stores, may cause the Company to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets, negatively affecting its financial results.\nThe Company makes certain accounting estimates and projections with regard to individual store operations as well as overall Company performance in connection with its impairment analyses for long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. An impairment charge may be required if the impairment analysis indicates that the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from the Company\u2019s estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, the Company\u2019s financial results could be negatively affected.\n8 PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. \u00ef 2016 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Profitability\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on its ability to operate in desirable locations at reasonable rental rates and to close underperforming stores at or before the conclusion of their lease terms.\nThe profitability of the business depends in large part on operating the current store base at a reasonable profit, opening and operating new stores at a reasonable profit, and identifying and closing underperforming stores. For a majority of the Company\u2019s current store base, a large portion of a store\u2019s operating expense is the cost associated with leasing the location. Management actively monitors individual store performance and attempts to negotiate favorable lease expenses to ensure stores can remain profitable or have the ability to rebound to a profitable state. Current locations may not continue to be desirable as the Company\u2019s omni-channel strategy evolves or demographics change, and the Company may choose to close underperforming stores before lease expiration and incur lease termination costs associated with those closings. On April 8, 2015, the Company announced that it had initiated a plan to optimize its store portfolio as part of its \u20181 Pier 1\u2019 strategy to drive growth through its omni-channel platform, reduce occupancy and payroll costs and improve efficiency. The Company\u2019s inability to achieve the desired cost reduction and improved efficiencies could negatively impact the Company\u2019s future growth and earnings. The Company cannot give assurance that opening new stores or an increase in closing underperforming stores will result in greater profits.\nThe success of the business depends on factors affecting consumer spending that are not controllable by the Company.\nConsumer spending, including spending for the home and home-related furnishings, depends upon many factors beyond general economic conditions (both domestic and international), including, among others, levels of employment, disposable consumer income, prevailing interest rates, changes in the housing market, consumer debt, costs of fuel and other energy sources, inflation, fears of recession or actual recession periods, war and fears of war, pandemics, inclement weather, tax rates and rate increases, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and global, national, regional and local political conditions (including the possibility of governmental shut downs), and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security. Unfavorable changes in factors affecting discretionary spending could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products, resulting in lower sales and negatively impact the business and its financial results.\nFailure to attract, motivate and retain an effective management team or changes in the cost or availability of a suitable workforce to manage and support the Company\u2019s stores, distribution and fulfillment centers and e-Commerce website could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in a large part, on being able to successfully attract, motivate and retain a qualified management team and associates. Sourcing qualified candidates to fill important positions within the Company, especially management, in the highly competitive retail environment may prove to be a challenge. The inability to recruit and retain such individuals could result in turnover in the home office, stores, and distribution and fulfillment centers, which could have a negative effect on the business. Management will continue to assess the Company\u2019s compensation and benefit program in an effort to attract future qualified candidates and retain current experienced management team members. The Company does not believe that its compensation policies, principles, objectives and practices are structured to promote inappropriate risk taking by its executives nor inappropriate risk taking by its associates whose behavior would be most affected by performance-based incentives. The Company believes that the focus of its overall compensation program encourages its associates to take a balanced approach that focuses on increasing and sustaining Pier 1 Imports\u2019 profitability.\nOccasionally the Company experiences union organizing activities in non-unionized distribution facilities. Similar activities could also occur in the stores. These types of activities may result in work slowdowns or stoppages, higher labor costs and higher operating expenses. Any increase in cost associated with labor organization at distribution facilities could result in higher costs to distribute inventory and could negatively impact margins.\nFailure to successfully manage the Company\u2019s omni-channel operations could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nIn fiscal 2016, the Company continued to implement its omni-channel strategy, \u20181 Pier 1\u2019. Successful execution of the omni-channel initiatives depends on the Company\u2019s ability to maintain uninterrupted availability of the Company\u2019s e-Commerce website and supporting applications, adequate and accurate inventory levels, timely and cost-effective fulfillment and delivery of customer\nPIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. \u00ef 2016 Form 10-K 9\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\norders, accurate shipping of undamaged product and coordination of those activities within the Company\u2019s retail stores. In addition, the Company\u2019s customer service function must maintain a high standard of customer care. Failure to successfully manage these processes may negatively impact sales, result in the loss of customers, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive retail environment with companies offering similar merchandise. If customers are lost to the Company\u2019s competitors, sales could decline.\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive specialty retail business competing with specialty sections of large general merchandise retailers and department stores, home furnishing retailers, small specialty stores, online retailers and marketplaces, and mass merchandising discounters. Management believes that the Company is competing for sales on the basis of style, pricing and quality of products, constantly changing merchandise assortment, visual presentation of its merchandise and customer service. The Company experiences added short-term competition when other retailers offer promotional pricing, including free shipping, or liquidate merchandise for various reasons. If the Company is unable to maintain a competitive position, it could experience negative pressure on retail prices and loss of customers, which in turn could result in reduced margins and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to seasonal variations, with a significant portion of its sales and earnings occurring during two months of the year.\nThe Company generally has its highest sales volumes during the November and December holiday selling season. Severe weather or failure to predict consumer demand correctly during these months could result in lost sales or gross margin erosion if merchandise must be marked down significantly to clear inventory.\nFactors that may or may not be controllable by the Company may negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results may be negatively impacted by increases in costs that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including items such as increases in fuel and transportation costs, higher interest rates, increases in losses from damaged merchandise, inflation, litigation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, higher costs of labor, labor disputes around the world, increases in the costs of insurance and healthcare, increases in postage and media costs, and higher tax rates. In addition, compliance with changes in laws and regulations and compliance with accounting standards and internal control requirements, may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be harmed by adverse weather conditions and natural disasters.\nExtreme or undesirable weather can negatively affect customer traffic in retail stores as well as customer shopping behavior. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, weather phenomena, and events causing infrastructure failures could negatively affect any of the Company\u2019s \u20181 Pier 1\u2019 operations, including its distribution and fulfillment centers, administrative facilities, logistics infrastructure, or operations of its suppliers domestically and in foreign countries.\nRisks Associated with Dependence on Technology\nThe Company is heavily dependent on various kinds of technology in the operation of its business.\nFailure of any critical software applications including software-as-a-service and cloud operations, technology infrastructure, telecommunications, data communications, data storage equipment, or networks could have a negative effect, including additional expense, on the Company\u2019s ability to manage the merchandise supply chain, sell merchandise, accomplish payment functions, report financial data or manage labor and staffing. Although the Company maintains off-site data backups, a concentration of technology-related risk exists in the Company\u2019s headquarters located in Fort Worth, Texas.\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of the Company\u2019s customers and associates could expose the Company to litigation and/or regulatory action and damage the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company receives and maintains certain personal and payment information of its customers, vendors and associates. The collection and use of this information by the Company is regulated at the international, national, federal and other political subdivision levels, and is subject to certain contractual restrictions in third-party agreements. Although the Company has\n10 PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. \u00ef 2016 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nimplemented processes to collect and protect the integrity and security of personal and payment information, there can be no assurance that this information will not be obtained by unauthorized persons, or collected or used inappropriately. If the security and information systems of the Company or of its internal or external business partners are compromised or its internal or external business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons, or collected or used inappropriately, it could negatively affect the Company\u2019s reputation and marketing initiatives, as well as operations and financial results, and could result in litigation and/or regulatory action against the Company including the imposition of penalties and fines. In addition, a compromise of the Company\u2019s systems could result in a disruption to operations and require expanded resources to remediate, investigate, correct and upgrade systems. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, the Company will incur additional costs to remain in compliance.\nFailure to successfully implement new information technology systems and enhance existing systems could negatively impact the business and its financial results.\nThe Company regularly invests in new information technology systems and implements modifications and upgrades to existing systems. These investments include replacing legacy systems, making changes to existing systems, building redundancies, acquiring new systems and hardware with updated functionality and cloud-based solutions such as software-as-a-service solutions and data storage. The Company believes it is taking appropriate actions to ensure the successful implementation of these initiatives, including the testing of new systems and the transfer of existing data, with minimal disruptions to the business. However, there can be no assurance the Company has anticipated all potential risks. Failure to successfully implement these initiatives could negatively impact the business and its financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations, including the expansion of the Company\u2019s e-Commerce website, are subject to inherent cybersecurity risks and e-Commerce related fraud that may disrupt its business and negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results and reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s e-Commerce functionality has increased the Company\u2019s exposure to cybersecurity risks and e-Commerce related fraud. A compromise of its security systems could result in a service disruption, or customers\u2019, associates\u2019 or vendors\u2019 personal or payment information or the Company\u2019s proprietary information being obtained by unauthorized users. Although the Company has implemented processes to mitigate the risks of security breaches, cyber incidents and e-Commerce related fraud, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur. These events could result in violation of privacy laws, potential litigation or regulatory action, increased costs and a loss of consumer confidence in its security measures, all of which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results and its reputation.\nFailure to maintain positive brand perception and recognition could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results and reputation.\nMaintaining a good reputation is critical to the Company\u2019s business. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has increased the risk that the Company\u2019s reputation could be negatively impacted in a short amount of time. If the Company is unable to quickly and effectively respond to occurrences of negative publicity through social media or otherwise, it may suffer declines in customer loyalty and traffic, vendor relationship issues, diversion of management\u2019s time to respond and other adverse effects, all of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results and its reputation.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions. Changes in these laws and requirements, or interpretations of them, may result in additional costs to the Company, including the costs of compliance as well as potential penalties and fines for non-compliance.\nLegislation on a local, regional, state, national or global level has the potential to have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s profitability or ability to operate its business. Compliance with certain legislation carries with it significant costs. The Company is subject to oversight by many governmental and quasi-governmental agencies in the course of operating its business because of its numerous locations, large number of associates, contact with consumers and importation and exportation of product. In addition, the Company is subject to regulations regarding consumer product quality and safety standards. Complying with regulations may cause the Company to incur significant expenses, including the costs associated with periodic audits and recalls. Failure to comply may also result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or additional costs in the form of litigation, financial penalties and fines or business interruptions.\nPIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. \u00ef 2016 Form 10-K 11\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe Company conducts business in many jurisdictions, including foreign countries. In many of these jurisdictions, the Company may be required to pay or collect import duties, national, state and local sales taxes or similar taxes at the point of sale or delivery of merchandise and remit such amounts to the appropriate authorities. The Company is also subject to income taxes, excise taxes, franchise taxes, payroll taxes and other special taxes. The Company is also required to maintain various kinds of business and commercial licenses to operate its stores and other facilities. Rates of taxation are beyond the Company\u2019s control, and increases in such rates or taxation methods and rules could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. Failure to comply with laws concerning the collection and remittance of taxes and with licensing requirements could also subject the Company to financial penalties and fines or business interruptions.\nRisks Associated with International Trade\nAs an importer and retailer of imported merchandise, the Company is subject to certain risks that typically do not affect retailers of domestically produced merchandise.\nThe Company must order merchandise well in advance of delivery and generally takes title to the merchandise at the time it is loaded for transport to designated U.S. destinations. Global political unrest, war, threats of war, terrorist acts or threats, especially threats to foreign and U.S. ports and piracy, disruption in the operation of the international portion of the Company\u2019s supply chain, labor unrest or natural disasters could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to import merchandise from certain countries. Although the Company pays for the vast majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative value of the U.S. dollar, restrictions on the convertibility of the dollar and other currencies, duties, preferential trade agreements including general system of preferences, taxes and other charges on imports, rising labor costs and cost of living in foreign countries, dock strikes, worker strikes, import quota systems and other restrictions sometimes placed on foreign trade can affect the price, delivery and availability of imported merchandise as well as exports to the Company\u2019s stores in other countries. The inability to import merchandise from China and other countries, unavailability of adequate shipping capacity at reasonable rates, or the imposition of significant tariffs could have a negative effect on the financial results of the Company. Ocean carriage and freight costs contribute a substantial amount to the cost of imported merchandise. Monitoring foreign vendors\u2019 compliance with applicable laws and Company standards, including quality and safety standards and social compliance issues, is more difficult than monitoring domestic vendors.\nGovernmental agencies have the authority to enforce trade agreements, resolve trade disputes and control market access to goods and services. Governments may also impose trade sanctions on foreign countries that are found to violate trade agreements or maintain laws or practices that are unjustifiable and restrict commerce. In these situations, governments may increase duties on imports from one or more foreign countries. The Company could be negatively affected by the imposition of trade sanctions.\nThe governments of the countries in which the Company does business maintain a variety of additional trade laws under which the Company\u2019s ability to import may be affected from time to time, including antidumping laws, countervailing duty laws, safeguard laws, and laws designed to protect intellectual property rights. Although the Company may not be directly involved in a particular trade dispute under any of these laws, its ability to import, or the terms and conditions under which it can continue to import, may be affected by the outcome of such disputes.\nThe Company imports merchandise from countries around the world and as a result may be affected from time to time by antidumping petitions alleging that foreign manufacturers are selling their own products at prices that are less than the prices that they charge in their home country market or in third country markets or at less than their cost of production. Such petitions, if successful, could significantly increase import duties on those products. In that event, the Company might decide to pay the increased duties, thereby reducing gross profits or increasing the price to consumers of the affected products. Alternatively, the Company might decide to source the product or a similar product from a different country not subject to increased duties or else discontinue the importation and sale of the product.\nDispute resolution processes in recent years have been utilized to resolve disputes regarding market access between the European Union, China, the United States and other countries. In some instances, these trade disputes can lead to threats by countries of sanctions against each other, which can include import prohibitions and increased duty rates on imported items. The Company considers any agreement that reduces tariff and non-tariff barriers in international trade to be beneficial to its business. Any type of sanction on imports is likely to increase the Company\u2019s import costs or limit the availability of merchandise purchased from sanctioned countries. In that case, the Company may be required to seek similar merchandise from other countries on terms that could be materially less favorable.\n12 PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. \u00ef 2016 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Relating to Liquidity\nIf the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it may not be able to fund its obligations, including debt related payments and capital expenditure requirements. Insufficient cash flows from operations could result in the substantial utilization of the Company\u2019s secured revolving credit facility or similar financing, which may limit the Company\u2019s ability to conduct certain activities.\nThe Company is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flows from operations to fund its obligations. The Company maintains a secured revolving credit facility to enable it to issue merchandise and special purpose standby letters of credit as well as to fund working capital requirements. Borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation consisting of a percentage of certain eligible assets of the Company and are subject to advance rates and commercially reasonable reserves. Substantial utilization of the available borrowing base will result in various restrictions on the Company, including restrictions on the ability of the Company to repurchase its common stock or pay dividends and an increase in the lender\u2019s control over the Company\u2019s cash accounts. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion - Secured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. The Company entered into a senior secured term loan facility in April of 2014. The proceeds of borrowing under the facility were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, and share repurchases and dividends permitted under the facility. Those borrowings have increased the Company\u2019s interest expense and financial leverage. The facility contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants that may also limit the Company\u2019s actions. Significant decreases in cash flows from operations could result in the Company borrowing increased amounts under its credit facilities to fund operational needs and increased utilization of letters of credit. These actions could result in the Company being subject to increased restrictions as described above and increase interest expense and overall leverage.\nA disruption in the global credit and equity markets could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms.\nIn the future, the Company could become dependent on the availability of adequate capital to fund its operations. Disruption in the global credit and equity markets and future disruptions in the financial markets could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to enter into new financing agreements or obtain funding through the sale of Company securities. A decline in economic conditions could also result in difficulties for financial institutions and other parties that the Company does business with, which could potentially affect the Company\u2019s ability to access financing under existing arrangements or to otherwise recover amounts as they become due under the Company\u2019s contractual agreements. The inability of the Company to obtain financing as needed on acceptable terms to fund its operations may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.", "PERMNO": 51692, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "PIRRQ"}
