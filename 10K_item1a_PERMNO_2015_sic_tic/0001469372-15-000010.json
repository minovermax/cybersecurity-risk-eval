Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Sports Business\nOur Sports Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe success of a sports business, like ours, is dependent upon the performance and/or popularity of its franchises. Our Knicks and Rangers and other sports franchises compete, in varying respects and degrees, with other live sporting events, and with sporting events delivered over television networks, radio, the Internet and online services, mobile applications and other alternative sources. For example, our sports teams compete for attendance, viewership and advertising with a wide range of alternatives available in the New York City metropolitan area. During some or all of the basketball and hockey seasons, our sports teams face competition, in varying respects and degrees, from professional baseball (including the Yankees and the Mets), professional football (including the Giants and the Jets), professional soccer (including the Red Bulls and the New York City Football Club) and each other. For fans who prefer the unique experience of NHL hockey, we must compete with two other NHL hockey teams located in the New York City metropolitan area (the Islanders and the Devils) as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NHL hockey teams and the NHL itself. Similarly, for those fans attracted to the equally unique experience of NBA basketball, we must compete with another NBA team located in the New York City metropolitan area (the Nets) as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NBA teams and the NBA itself.\nAs a result of the large number of options available, we face strong competition for the New York area sports fan. We must compete with these other sports teams and sporting events, in varying respects and degrees, including on the basis of the quality of the teams we field, their success in the leagues in which they compete, our ability to provide an entertaining environment at our games, prices we charge for tickets and the viewing availability of our teams on multiple media alternatives. Given the nature of sports, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, including with companies that may have greater resources than we have, and as a consequence, our business and results of operations may be materially negatively affected.\nOur Basketball and Hockey Decisions, Especially Those Concerning Player Selection and Salaries, May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nCreating and maintaining our sports teams\u2019 popularity and/or on-court and on-ice competitiveness is key to the success of our sports business. Accordingly, efforts to improve our revenues and earnings from operations from period to period may be secondary to actions that management believes will generate long-term value. As with other sports teams, the competitive positions of our sports teams depend primarily on our ability to develop, obtain and retain talented players, coaches and team executives, for which we compete with other professional sports teams. Our efforts in this regard may include, among other things, trading for highly compensated players, signing draft picks, free agents or current players to new contracts, engaging in salary arbitration with existing players and terminating and waiving players. Any of these actions could increase expenses for a particular period, subject to any salary cap restrictions contained in the respective leagues\u2019 collective bargaining agreements (each, a \u201cCBA\u201d). There can be no assurance that any actions taken by management to increase our long-term value will be successful.\nA significant factor in our ability to attract and retain talented players is player compensation. NBA and NHL player salaries have generally increased significantly and may continue to increase. Although collective bargaining agreements between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association (\u201cNBPA\u201d) and the NHL and the National Hockey League Players\u2019 Association (\u201cNHLPA\u201d) generally cap league-wide player salaries at a prescribed percentage of league-wide revenues, we may pay our players different aggregate salaries and a different proportion of our revenues than other NBA or NHL franchises. Future collective bargaining agreements may increase the percentage of league-wide revenues to which NBA or NHL players are entitled or impose other conditions, which may further increase our costs. In addition, we may also be obligated to pay the NBA a luxury tax each year, the calculation of which is determined by a formula based on the aggregate salaries paid to our NBA players. The Knicks incurred a luxury tax expense of $8.3 million, $38.1 million and $5.1 million with respect to the 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons, respectively. If the Knicks are ultimately an NBA luxury tax payer for either of the 2015-16 or 2016-17 seasons, our NBA luxury tax obligations may increase substantially. See \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview - MSG Sports - Expenses - Player Salaries, Escrow System/Revenue Sharing and Luxury Tax - NBA Luxury Tax.\u201d\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant charges for costs associated with transactions relating to players on our sports teams for season-ending and career-ending injuries and for trades, waivers and contract terminations of players and other team personnel, including team executives. These transactions can result in significant charges as the Company recognizes the estimated ultimate costs of these events in the period in which they occur, although amounts due to these\nindividuals are generally paid over their remaining contract terms. These expenses add to the volatility of the results of our MSG Sports segment.\nThe Actions of the Basketball and Hockey Leagues May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe governing bodies of the NBA (including the WNBA and the NBADL) and the NHL have certain rights under certain circumstances to take actions that they deem to be in the best interests of their respective leagues, which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing our results of operations and which could affect our teams in ways that are different than the impact on other teams. Certain of these decisions by the NBA or the NHL could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. From time to time, we may disagree with or challenge actions the leagues take or the power and authority they assert. The following discussion highlights certain areas in which decisions of the NBA and the NHL could materially affect our businesses.\nThe NBA and the NHL may assert control over certain matters, under certain circumstances, that may affect our revenues such as the national and international rights to telecast the games of league members, including the Knicks and Rangers, licensing of the rights to produce and sell merchandise bearing the logos and/or other intellectual property of our teams and the leagues, and the Internet-based activities of our teams. The NBA and NHL have each entered into agreements regarding the national and international telecasts of NBA and NHL games. We receive a share of the income the NBA and the NHL generate from these contracts, which expire from time to time. There can be no assurance that the NBA or the NHL will be able to renew these contracts following their expiration on terms as favorable to us as those in the current agreements or that we will continue to receive the same level of revenues in the future. Changes to league rules, regulations and/or agreements, including national and international telecast rights, could also impact the availability of games covered by our local telecast rights and could negatively affect our business and results of operations. The leagues have asserted control over certain other important decisions, under certain circumstances, such as the length and format of the playing season, including pre-season and playoff schedules, the operating territories of the member teams, admission of new members, franchise relocations, labor relations with the players associations, collective bargaining, free agency, and luxury taxes and revenue sharing. Decisions on these matters, some of which are also subject to the terms of the relevant CBA, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, the NBA imposes a luxury tax and escrow system with respect to player salaries and a revenue sharing plan. For fiscal year 2015, the Knicks recorded approximately $28.8 million in estimated revenue sharing expenses, net of escrow receipts. The actual amounts for the 2014-15 season may vary significantly from the estimate based on actual operating results for the league and all teams for the season and other factors. For a discussion of the NBA luxury tax impacts, see \u201c- Risks Relating to Our Sports Business - Our Basketball and Hockey Decisions, Especially Those Concerning Player Selection and Salaries, May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations\u201d above.\nThe NBA and the NHL have imposed certain restrictions on the ability of owners to undertake some types of transactions in respect of teams, including a change in ownership, a relocation of a team and certain types of financing transactions. In certain instances, these restrictions could impair our ability to proceed with a transaction that is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders if we were unable to obtain any required league approvals in a timely manner or at all.\nThe leagues impose certain rules that define, under certain circumstances, the territories in which we operate, including the markets in which our games can be telecast. Changes to these rules could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nEach league\u2019s governing body has imposed a number of rules, regulations, guidelines, bulletins, directives, policies and agreements upon its teams. Changes to these provisions may apply to our sports teams and their personnel, and the Company as a whole, regardless of whether we agree or disagree with such changes, have voted against such changes or have challenged them through other means, and it is possible that any such changes could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations to the extent they are ultimately determined to bind our teams. The commissioners of each of the NBA and NHL assert significant authority to take certain actions on behalf of their respective leagues under certain circumstances. Decisions by the commissioners of the NBA and the NHL, including on the matters described above, may materially negatively affect our businesses and results of operations. The leagues\u2019 governing documents and our agreements with the leagues purport to limit the manner in which we may challenge decisions and actions by a league commissioner or the league itself.\nInjuries to Players on Our Sports Teams Could Hinder Our Success.\nTo the degree that our financial results are dependent on our sports teams\u2019 popularity and/or on-court and on-ice success, the likelihood of achieving such popularity or competitive success may, given the nature of sports, be substantially impacted by serious and/or untimely injuries to key players. Nearly all of our Knicks and Rangers players, including those with multi-year contracts, have partially or fully guaranteed contracts, meaning that in some cases (subject to the terms of the applicable player\ncontract and CBA), a player or his estate may be entitled to receive his salary even if the player dies or is unable to play as a result of injury. These salaries represent significant financial commitments for our sports teams. We are generally insured against having to pay salaries in the event of a player\u2019s death and seek to obtain disability insurance policies for substantially all of our material player contracts. In the event of injuries sustained resulting in lost services (as defined in the insurance policies), generally the insurance policies provide for payment to us of a portion of the player\u2019s salary for the remaining term of the contract or until the player can resume play, in each case following a deductible number of missed games. Such insurance may not be available in every circumstance or on terms that are commercially feasible or such insurance may contain significant dollar limits and/or exclusions from coverage for preexisting medical conditions. We may choose not to obtain (or may not be able to obtain) such insurance in some cases and we may change coverage levels (or be unable to change coverage levels) in the future.\nIn the absence of disability insurance, we may be obligated to pay all of an injured player\u2019s salary. In addition, player disability insurance policies do not cover any NBA luxury tax that we may be required to pay under the NBA CBA. For purposes of determining NBA luxury tax under the NBA CBA, salary payable to an injured player is included in team salary, unless and until that player\u2019s salary is removed from the team salary for purposes of calculating NBA luxury tax which, pursuant to the terms of the NBA CBA, requires a waiting period of one year and satisfaction of other conditions. Replacement of an injured player may result in an increase in salary and NBA luxury tax expense for us.\nRisks Relating to Our Entertainment Business\nOur Entertainment Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur entertainment business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, with other leisure-time activities such as live performances, sporting events, the Internet, online and mobile services, including sites for online content distribution, video on demand, event live streaming and other alternative sources of entertainment and information, television, radio and motion pictures. In addition, our entertainment business competes for concerts with other event venues for total entertainment dollars in our marketplace. The success of our entertainment business is largely dependent on the continued success of our Radio City Christmas Spectacular, and, to a lesser extent, the availability of, and our venues\u2019 ability to attract, concerts, family shows and other events, competition for which is intense, and the ability of acts to attract strong attendance at our venues. For example, The Garden, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre all compete with other entertainment options in the New York City metropolitan area. The Forum, The Chicago Theatre and the Wang Theatre face similar competition from other entertainment options in their respective markets and elsewhere.\nFurther, in order to maintain the competitive positions of The Garden and our other venues, we must invest on a continuous basis in state-of-the-art technology and facility maintenance while maintaining a competitive pricing structure for events that may be held in our venues, many of which have alternative venue options available to them in New York and other cities. In addition, we invest a substantial amount in our Radio City Christmas Spectacular and in new productions, including New York Spring Spectacular, a new large-scale theatrical production for Radio City Music Hall, to continue to attract audiences. We cannot assure you that such investments will generate revenues that are sufficient to justify our investment or even that exceed our expenses.\nThe Success of Our Entertainment Business Depends on the Continued Popularity of Our Live Productions, Particularly the Radio City Christmas Spectacular the Decline of Which Could Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe financial results of our entertainment business are dependent on the popularity of our live productions, particularly the Radio City Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall, which represented 24% of our MSG Entertainment segment\u2019s revenues in fiscal year 2015. Should the popularity of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular decline, our revenues from ticket sales, and concession and merchandise sales would likely also decline, and we might not be able to replace the lost revenue with revenues from other sources.\nOur Strategy for Our Entertainment Business Includes the Development of New Live Productions and the Possible Addition of New Venues, Each of Which Could Require Us to Make Considerable Investments for Which There Can Be No Guarantee of Success.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to develop new productions and live entertainment events, which may include expansions or enhancements of our existing productions or relationships or the creation of entirely new live productions. Expansion or enhancement of productions and/or the development of new productions could require significant upfront investment in sets, staging, creative processes, casting and advertising and dislocation of other alternative sources of entertainment that may have played in our venues absent these productions. For example, we have invested in New York Spring\nSpectacular, a new large-scale theatrical production for Radio City Music Hall. To the extent that any efforts at expanding or enhancing productions or creating new productions do not result in a viable live show, or to the extent that any such productions do not achieve expected levels of popularity among audiences, we may be subject to a write-down of all or a portion of such investments. In addition, any delay in launching such productions or enhancements could result in the incurrence of operating costs which may not be recouped. For example, the Company postponed and significantly revised New York Spring Spectacular from its planned debut in March 2014. Our strategy also involves the possible investment in, or the operation or acquisition of, venues, in our current markets and markets beyond New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston. Any such additions may involve purchasing or acquiring control of, or an investment in, existing venues, renovating acquired venues or constructing new venues and could require significant investment. For example, in January 2014 we re-opened the Forum, the iconic arena in Inglewood, CA, which we acquired in June 2012. In pursuing such an expansion strategy, we will face risks, potentially including risks associated with the construction of new facilities or renovations of existing facilities, such as cost overruns and construction delays, risks associated with financing, such as the potential lack of available financing to commence or complete an acquisition, development or renovation, risks associated with operating in new or existing markets and the risk that we may lose all or a part of our investment in any additional venues.\nRisks Relating to Our Media Business\nOur Media Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur media business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, for viewers and advertisers with other programming networks, pay-per-view, video on demand, event live streaming, and other content offered on cable television and other programming distribution systems. We also compete for viewers and advertisers with the Internet and broadband services, mobile media, radio, motion picture, home video and other sources of information and entertainment and advertising services. Important competitive factors are the prices charged for programming, the quantity, quality (in particular, the on-court and on-ice performance of our sports teams as well as other teams whose media rights we control) and the variety of the programming offered and the effectiveness of marketing efforts.\nThe competitive environment in which our media business operates may be affected by technological developments. It is difficult to predict the future effect of technology on many of the factors affecting our competitive position. For example, data compression technology has made it possible for most programming distributors to increase their channel capacity, which may reduce the competition among programming networks and broadcasters for channel space. On the other hand, the addition of channel space could also increase competition for desired entertainment and sports programming and ultimately, for viewing by subscribers. As more channel space becomes available, maintaining and/or enhancing the position of our programming networks in the most favorable tiers of these distributors would be an important goal that we might not achieve.\nWith respect to advertising services, factors affecting the degree and extent of competition include prices, reach and audience demographics among others. Some of our competitors are large companies that have greater financial resources available to them than we do which could impact our programming viewership and the resulting advertising sales by our media business.\nWe May Not Be Able to Adapt to New Content Distribution Platforms and to Changes in Consumer Behavior Resulting from These New Technologies, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWe must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry, including the emergence of alternative distribution platforms. Our ability to exploit new distribution platforms and viewing technologies will affect our ability to maintain or grow our business. Emerging forms of content distribution may provide different economic models and compete with current distribution methods in ways that are not entirely predictable. Such competition could reduce demand for our traditional television offerings or for the offerings of digital distributors and reduce our revenue from these sources. Accordingly, we must adapt to changing consumer behavior driven by advances such as digital video recorders, video on demand, Internet-based and broadband content delivery, including services such as Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV, Google TV and Amazon, and mobile devices. Gaming and other consoles such as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox, Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Nintendo\u2019s Wii and Roku are also seeking to establish themselves as alternative providers of video services. Such changes may impact the revenues we are able to generate from our traditional distribution methods, either by decreasing the viewership of our programming networks on cable and other multichannel video programming distribution systems (or by making advertising on our programming networks less valuable to advertisers. If we fail to adapt our distribution methods and content to emerging technologies, our appeal to our targeted audiences might decline and there could be a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, advertising revenues could be significantly impacted by emerging technologies, given that advertising sales are dependent on audience measurement provided by third parties, and the results of audience measurement techniques can vary independent of the size of the audience for a variety of reasons, including difficulties related to the employed statistical sampling methods, new\ndistribution platforms and viewing technologies, and the shifting of the marketplace to the use of measurement of different viewer behaviors, such as delayed viewing. Moreover, devices that allow users to fast forward or skip programming, including commercials, are causing changes in consumer behavior that may affect the desirability of our programming services to advertisers.\nThe Success of Our Media Business Depends on Affiliation Fees We Receive Under our Affiliation Agreements, the Loss of Which or Renewal of Which on Less Favorable Terms May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur success is dependent upon the existence and terms of agreements between our programming networks and Distributors. Existing affiliation agreements of our programming networks expire at various dates. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to renew these affiliation agreements, or obtain terms as attractive as our existing agreements in the event of a renewal. Affiliation fees constitute a significant majority of our media business\u2019 revenues. Changes in affiliation fee revenues result from a combination of changes in rates and/or changes in subscriber counts, factors that may be largely out of our control. For example, Distributors may introduce, market and/or modify tiers of programming networks that could impact the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks. The Company has experienced a decrease in subscribers which it believes is due, in part, to a migration of subscribers to lower-priced distributor tiers that do not include MSG Networks. A reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage of our programming networks, could adversely affect our affiliation fee revenue. Such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programming thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenues.\nOur affiliation agreements generally require us to meet certain content criteria, such as minimum thresholds for professional event telecasts throughout the year for MSG Networks. If we were unable to meet these criteria, we could become subject to remedies available to the Distributors, which may include fee reductions, rebates or refunds and/or termination of these agreements in some cases.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, an existing affiliation agreement may expire and the parties may have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In certain of these circumstances, the affiliate may continue to carry the service(s) until execution of definitive renewal or replacement agreements (or until we or the affiliate determine that carriage should cease).\nThe loss of any of our significant Distributors or, the failure to renew on terms as attractive as our existing agreements (or to do so in a timely manner) or disputes with our counterparties on the interpretation of their agreements with us could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nFurther Consolidation Among Cable and Satellite Providers Could Adversely Affect Our Revenue and Profitability.\nThe pay television industry is highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of Distributors serving a significant percentage of pay television subscribers that receive our networks, thereby affording the largest Distributors significant leverage in their relationship with programming networks, including us. Substantially all of our distribution revenues come from our top five Distributors. In addition to the pending Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable merger (which is subject to regulatory approval), further consolidation in the industry could reduce the number of Distributors available to distribute our programming services and increase the negotiating leverage of Distributors, which could adversely affect our revenue. In some cases, if a Distributor is acquired, the affiliation agreement of the acquiring Distributor will govern following the acquisition. In those circumstances, the acquisition of a Distributor that is a party to one or more affiliation agreements with us on terms that are more favorable to us could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe Derive Substantial Revenues from the Sale of Advertising Time and Those Revenues Are Subject to a Number of Factors, Many of Which Are Beyond Our Control.\nOur media business is dependent on advertising revenues, which, in turn, depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as the health of the economy in the markets our businesses serve and in the nation as a whole, general economic trends in the advertising industry, the popularity of our programming, the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based media (such as Internet, mobile media, cable television, radio and newspaper), technological developments (such as use of DVRs) and consumer adoption thereof, consumer budgeting and buying patterns, extent of distribution and team performance. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities, which could cause our revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period. In addition, we cannot ensure that our programming will achieve favorable ratings. Our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, the level of distribution of our programming, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. A shift in viewer preferences could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings for\nour programming and materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. As noted below, MSG Spinco will have the exclusive right and obligation to sell our advertising availabilities on our behalf for a commission following the Spinco Distribution and our advertising revenues will be dependent to a material extent on MSG Spinco\u2019s performance subject to certain termination rights. See \u201c - Risks Relating to the Impact of the Potential Spin-off Transaction - If the Spinco Distribution Occurs, We Will Rely on MSG Spinco\u2019s Performance Under Various Agreements, and Particularly the Media Rights Agreements and Advertising Sales Representation Agreement.\u201d\nOur Rights Agreements with Various Professional Sports Teams that We Do Not Own Have Varying Durations and Renewal Terms and We May Be Unable to Renew Those Agreements on Acceptable Terms or Such Rights May Be Lost for Other Reasons.\nIn addition to carrying the games of the Knicks and Rangers, our media business has rights agreements with other professional sports teams that we do not control. Following the Spinco Distribution, our relationship with the Knicks and the Rangers will be governed by the terms of our media rights agreements covering those teams. We may seek renewal of these contracts and, if we do, we may be outbid by competing networks for these contracts or the renewal costs could substantially exceed our costs under the current contracts. One or more of these teams may seek to establish their own programming network or join a competitor\u2019s network and, in certain circumstances, we may not have an opportunity to bid for the rights. Moreover, the value of these contracts may also be affected by various league decisions and/or league agreements that we may not be able to control, including a decision to alter the number of games played during a season. The value of these rights can also be affected, or we could lose such rights entirely, if a team is liquidated, undergoes reorganization in bankruptcy or relocates to an area where it is not possible or commercially feasible for us to continue to distribute games. Any loss or diminution in the value of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by us and could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, our distribution agreements typically include certain remedies in the event our networks fail to meet a minimum number of professional events, and, accordingly, any loss of rights could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nEach league\u2019s governing body has imposed a number of rules, regulations, guidelines, bulletins, directives, policies and agreements upon its teams, including the teams we carry on our networks. Changes to these provisions could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe May Be Unable to Obtain Programming from Third Parties on Reasonable Terms or at All, Which Could Lead to Higher Costs.\nWe rely on third parties for sports and other programming for our networks. We compete with other distributors of programming, including other programming networks and Internet and other distributors, to acquire the rights to distribute such programming. If we fail to continue to obtain sports and other programming for our networks on reasonable terms for any reason, including as a result of competition, we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming, which may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Business Depends on the Appeal of Our Programming Which May be Unpredictable and Increased Programming Costs May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur business depends in part upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of the programming on our networks. These factors are often unpredictable and subject to influences that are beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment options. We may not be able to successfully predict interest in proposed new programming and viewer preferences could cause new programming not to be successful or cause our existing programming to decline in popularity. An increase in our costs associated with programming, including original programming, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations to the extent we do not predict accurately how audiences will respond to such programming.\nGeneral Risks\nOur Business Has Been Adversely Impacted and May, in the Future, Be Materially Adversely Impacted by an Economic Downturn and Financial Instability.\nOur businesses depend upon the ability and willingness of consumers and businesses to purchase tickets (including season tickets) at our venues, to license suites at The Garden and to spend on concessions and merchandise and to subscribe to a pay television package that include our networks. In addition, our business is dependent upon advertising and sponsorship revenues. As a result, instability and weakness of the U.S. and global economies and the negative effects on consumers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 discretionary spending may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nSevere Weather May Impact Events at Our Venues and Disrupt Distributors\u2019 Ability to Offer Pay Television Service, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWeather conditions in the New York metropolitan area and other locations in which we own or operate venues may affect patron attendance as well as sales of concessions and merchandise, among other things. Weather conditions may also require us to cancel or postpone events or prevent us or our Distributors from providing our programming to customers. Any of these events may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Business Could be Adversely Affected by Terrorist Activity or the Threat of Terrorist Activity and Other Developments that Discourage Congregation at Prominent Places of Public Assembly.\nThe success of our businesses is dependent upon the willingness and ability of patrons to attend events at our venues. The venues we operate, like all prominent places of public assembly, could be the target of terrorist activities or other actions that discourage attendance. Any such activity at one of our venues could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, terrorist activity or other actions that discourage attendance at other locations, or even the threat of such activity, could result in reduced attendance at our venues. Similarly, a major epidemic or pandemic, or the threat of such an event, could adversely affect attendance at our events.\nOur Businesses Are Substantially Dependent on the Continued Popularity and/or Competitive Success of the Knicks and Rangers, Which Cannot Be Assured.\nOur financial results have historically been dependent on, and are expected to continue to depend in large part on, the Knicks and Rangers remaining popular with their fan bases and, in varying degrees, on the teams achieving on-court and on-ice success, which can generate fan enthusiasm, resulting in sustained ticket, premium seating, suite, concession and merchandise sales during the regular season, greater shares of total viewership and increased advertising sales. Furthermore, success in the regular season may qualify a team for participation in post-season playoffs, which provides us with additional revenue by increasing the number of games played by our teams and, more importantly, by generating increased excitement and interest in our teams, which can improve attendance and viewership in subsequent seasons. There can be no assurance that any sports team, including the Knicks and Rangers, will compete in post-season play in the future. Moreover, following the Spinco Distribution, we will no longer have control over decisions relating to the Knicks and the Rangers, such as decisions on player salaries, free-agency and player trades, which could materially affect the on-court performance and popularity of the relevant team.\nWe May Pursue Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions to Complement or Expand our Business that May Not be Successful; We Have Significant Investments in Businesses We Do Not Control.\nFrom time to time, we explore opportunities to purchase or invest in other businesses, venues or assets that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities, including opportunities that may differ from the Company\u2019s current business. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve risks, including the commitment of significant capital, the incurrence of indebtedness, the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from our existing business to develop and integrate the acquired or combined business, the risk of not achieving the intended results and the exposure to losses if the underlying transactions or ventures are not successful. We have significant investments in businesses that we account for under the equity method of accounting. We do not control the day-to-day operations of these businesses. Additionally, these businesses are subject to laws, rules and other circumstances, and have risks in their operations, which may be similar to, or different from, those to which we are subject. To the extent that these investments are not successful, we may be subject to a write-down of all or a portion of such investments. Any of the foregoing risks could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations or adversely impact the value of our investments.\nWe Do Not Own All of Our Venues and Our Failure to Renew Our Leases or Booking Agreement on Economically Attractive Terms May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations; Our Lease on Radio City Music Hall Requires Us to Maintain a Certain Net Worth or Meet Certain Other Requirements.\nThe lease on Radio City Music Hall expires in 2023. We have the option to renew the lease for an additional ten years by providing two years\u2019 notice prior to the initial expiration date. Similarly, we lease the Beacon Theatre pursuant to a lease that expires in 2026. We have entered into a booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. Our booking agreement expires in 2019 and we have the option to renew the agreement at that time for an additional ten years by providing significant prior notice to the initial expiration date. If we are unable to renew these leases or the booking agreement on economically attractive terms, our business could be materially negatively affected. In addition, the entity that guarantees the Radio City Music Hall lease is required to maintain a certain net worth or, if such net worth is not maintained,\nthe entity must either post a letter of credit or provide cash collateral.\nWe Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Our Failure to Comply with These Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nOur programming business is subject to direct and indirect government regulation, in part as a result of federal communications laws and FCC regulations that apply because we have common directors, officers, and stockholders with Cablevision. For FCC purposes, the common directors and officers, and the five percent or greater stockholders of each of us and Cablevision are deemed to hold attributable interests in each of the companies. As a result, certain regulations applicable to a programming network affiliated with a cable television operator apply to us. This affiliation may also limit the activities or strategic business alternatives available to us, including the ability to own or operate media properties we do not presently own or operate.\nSome FCC regulations apply to us directly and other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators, affect programming networks indirectly. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation - Regulation of Our Media Business.\u201d Legislative enactments, court actions, and federal regulatory proceedings could materially affect our programming business by modifying the rates, terms, and conditions under which we offer our programming services to distributors and the public, or otherwise materially affect the range of our activities or strategic business alternatives. We cannot predict the likelihood or results of any such legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions. Furthermore, to the extent that regulations and laws, either presently in force or proposed, hinder or stimulate the growth of the cable television and satellite industries, our programming business will be affected. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our programming business. The regulation of cable television services and satellite carriers is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past two decades. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated. We cannot assure you that our programming business and our results of operations will not be materially negatively affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.\nWe hold liquor licenses at each of our venues and are subject to licensing requirements with respect to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the jurisdictions in which we serve those beverages. Failure to receive or retain, or the suspension of, liquor licenses or permits could interrupt or terminate our ability to serve alcoholic beverages at the applicable venue and could have a material negative effect on our business and our results of operations. Additional regulation relating to liquor licenses may limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance, or both. In the jurisdictions in which our venues are located, we are subject to statutes that generally provide that serving alcohol to a visibly intoxicated or minor patron is a violation of the law and may provide for strict liability for such violations. Our liability insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover any potential liability.\nWe and our venues are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, disposal, storage, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances, as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect, among other things, the operations of our venues. Additionally, certain laws and regulations could hold us strictly, jointly and severally responsible for the remediation of hazardous substance contamination at our facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites, and could hold us responsible for any personal or property damage related to any contamination. Any requirements to dispose of, or remediate, such hazardous or non-hazardous materials and any associated costs and impact on operations of such efforts may be heightened as a result of the purchase, construction or renovation of a venue.\nOur venues are subject to zoning and building regulations including permits relating to the operation of The Garden. In addition, The Garden requires a zoning special permit. The original permit was granted by the New York City Planning Commission in 1963 and renewed in July 2013 for 10 years. In connection with the renewal, certain government officials and special interest groups sought to use the renewal process to pressure us to improve Penn Station or to relocate The Garden. There can be no assurance regarding the future renewal of the permit or the terms thereof.\nOur businesses are, and may in the future be, subject to a variety of other laws and regulations, including licensing, permitting, and historic designation and similar requirements; working conditions, labor, immigration and employment laws; health, safety and sanitation requirements; compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act; and privacy laws.\nOur failure to comply with applicable governmental laws and regulations, or to maintain necessary permits or licenses, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Properties Are Subject to, and Benefit from, Certain Easements, the Availability of Which May Not Continue on Terms Favorable to Us or at All.\nOur properties are subject to, and benefit from, certain easements. For example, the \u201cbreezeway\u201d into the Madison Square Garden Complex (which includes both The Garden and The Theater at Madison Square Garden) from Seventh Avenue in New York City is a significant easement that we share with other property owners. Our ability to continue to utilize this and other\neasements, including for advertising purposes, requires us to comply with a number of conditions. Moreover, certain adjoining property owners have easements over our property, which we are required to maintain so long as those property owners meet certain conditions. It is possible that we will be unable to continue to access or maintain any easements on terms favorable to us, or at all, which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe May Be Exposed to Business, Reputational and Litigation Risk if there Is Loss, Disclosure or Misappropriation of or Access to Our Customers\u2019 or Employee\u2019s Stored Personal Information or Other Breaches of Our Information Security.\nThrough our operations, we collect and store, including by electronic means, certain personal information and payment card information that our customers provide to make purchases, register on our web sites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. These activities require the use of online services and centralized data storage, including through third party service providers. Data maintained in electronic form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering or theft. Our ability to safeguard our customers\u2019 personal information and other confidential information, including information regarding the Company and our distributors, advertisers and employees, is important to our business. We take these matters seriously and take significant steps to protect our stored information. These protections are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the risks of a data breach cannot be entirely eliminated and our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit consumer, distributor, advertiser, Company, employee and other confidential information may be compromised by a malicious penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider. As a result, our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information and our distributors\u2019 and advertisers\u2019 confidential information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their consent, and the security of our other confidential information may be compromised.\nIf our electronically stored data is compromised, our ability to conduct business may be interrupted or impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Further, a penetration of our network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal or confidential information could subject us to business and litigation risk and damage our reputation, which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nA Change to or Withdrawal of New York City Real Estate Tax Exemption May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nMany arenas, ballparks and stadiums nationally and in New York City have received significant public support, such as tax exempt financing, other tax benefits, direct subsidies and other contributions, including for public infrastructure critical to the facilities such as parking lots and transit improvements. Our Madison Square Garden Complex benefits from a more limited real estate tax exemption pursuant to an agreement with the City of New York, subject to certain conditions, and legislation enacted by the State of New York in 1982. For fiscal year 2015 this tax exemption will result in an annual after-tax benefit to net income of approximately $23.3 million. From time to time there have been calls to repeal or amend the tax exemption. Repeal or amendment would require legislative action by New York State. There can be no assurance that the tax exemption will not be amended in a manner adverse to us or repealed in its entirety, either of which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe May Require Financing to Fund Our Ongoing Operations and Capital Expenditures, the Availability of Which is Highly Uncertain.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience volatility and disruption. Such markets can exert extreme downward pressure on stock prices and upward pressure on the cost of new debt capital and can severely restrict credit availability for most issuers.\nOur business has been characterized by significant expenditures for properties, businesses, renovations and productions. In the future we may engage in transactions that depend on our ability to obtain financing. We may also seek financing to fund our ongoing operations.\nAlthough we have a revolving credit facility (see \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Agreements\u201d), our ability to draw on such facility will depend on our ability to meet certain financial tests and other conditions. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any such facility in the future or raise any required additional capital or do so on favorable terms. Depending upon conditions in the financial markets and/or the Company\u2019s financial performance, we may not be able to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, as described above, until the completion of the Spinco Distribution the leagues in which our sports teams compete may have, under certain circumstances, approval rights over certain financing transactions, and in connection with those rights, could affect our ability to obtain such financing. If we are unable to pursue our current and future spending programs, we may be forced to cancel or scale back those programs. Failure to successfully pursue our capital\nexpenditure and other spending plans could negatively affect our ability to compete effectively and have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Business is Subject to Seasonal Fluctuations.\nThe revenues of our MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment segments have been seasonal and we expect they will continue to be seasonal. For example, 24% of our MSG Entertainment segment\u2019s revenues and 6% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2015, were derived from the Radio City Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall. Revenues of our MSG Entertainment segment are highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year when these performances primarily occur. As a result, MSG Entertainment earned a disproportionate amount of its revenue and operating income in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Similarly, because of the nature of the NBA and NHL playing seasons, revenues from our sports teams are concentrated in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year. Revenues from our business on a consolidated basis tend to be at their lowest in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year.\nOrganized Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur business is dependent upon the efforts of unionized workers. Any labor disputes, such as strikes or lockouts, with the unions with which we have CBAs could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations (including our ability to produce or present concerts, theatrical productions, sporting events, television programming and other events).\nNBA players are covered by a CBA between the NBPA and the NBA. NHL players are covered by a CBA between the NHLPA and the NHL. Both the NBA and the NHL have experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues in the future. Labor difficulties may include players\u2019 strikes or management lockouts. For example, the NBA has experienced labor difficulties, including a lockout during the 1998-99 season, which resulted in the regular season being shortened from 82 to 50 games, and a lockout during the 2011-12 season, which resulted in the regular season being shortened from 82 games to 66 games. The current NBA CBA expires after the 2020-21 season (although the NBA and NBPA each have the right to terminate the CBA effective following the 2016-17 season). The NHL has also experienced labor difficulties, including a lockout during the 1994-95 NHL season, which resulted in the regular season being shortened from 84 to 48 games, a lockout beginning in September 2004, which resulted in the cancellation of the entire 2004-05 NHL season and a lockout during the 2012-13 NHL season, which resulted in the regular season being shortened from 82 to 48 games. The current NHL CBA expires on September 15, 2022 (although the NHL and NHLPA each have the right to terminate the CBA effective following the 2019-20 season).\nThe Unavailability of Satellites, Facilities and/or Systems Upon Which We Rely May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWe use satellite and other systems to transmit our program services to Distributors. The distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. Notwithstanding certain back-up and redundant systems, transmissions may be disrupted, including as a result of disasters that impair uplinks, downlinks or transmission facilities or the impairment of satellite or terrestrial facilities. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If a disruption occurs, we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner. In addition, we rely upon various internal and third-party software or systems in the operation of our business, including, with respect to ticket sales, credit card processing, point of sale transactions, database, inventory, human resource management and financial systems. From time to time, certain of these arrangements may not be covered by long-term agreements. The failure or unavailability of distribution facilities or these internal and third-party services or systems, depending upon its severity and duration, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe May Become Subject to Infringement or Other Claims Relating to Our Content or Technology.\nFrom time to time, third parties may assert against us alleged intellectual property (e.g., copyright, trademark and patent) or other claims relating to our programming, productions, technologies or other content or material, some of which may be important to our business. In addition, our programming and productions could potentially subject us to claims of defamation or similar types of allegations. Any such claims, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs. In addition, if we are unable to continue use of certain intellectual property rights, our business and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted.\nTheft of Our Intellectual Property May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights to our television programming, productions, technologies, digital content and other content that is material to our business. Theft of our intellectual property, including content, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations because it may reduce the revenue that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content,\nundermine lawful distribution channels, limit our ability to control the marketing of our content and inhibit our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome, could cause us to incur significant costs.\nThere Is the Risk of Personal Injuries and Accidents in Connection with Our Venues, Which Could Subject Us to Personal Injury or Other Claims; We are Subject to the Risk of Adverse Outcomes In Other Types of Litigation.\nThere are inherent risks associated with producing and hosting events and operating, maintaining or renovating our venues. As a result, personal injuries, accidents and other incidents have occurred and may occur from time to time, which could subject us to claims and liabilities. Incidents in connection with events at any of our venues could also reduce attendance at our events, and cause a decrease in our revenue and operating income.\nWhile we seek to obtain contractual indemnities for events at our venues and we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage for incidents in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that such indemnities or insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances.\nFrom time to time, we become subject to other kinds of litigation. The outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable. As a result, we could incur liability from litigation which could be material and for which we may have inadequate or no insurance coverage or be subject to other forms of relief which might adversely affect the Company.\nWe May Have a Significant Indemnity Obligation to Cablevision if the MSG Distribution Is Treated as a Taxable Transaction.\nPrior to the MSG Distribution, Cablevision received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to the effect that, among other things, the MSG Distribution and certain related transactions would qualify for tax-free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nAlthough a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request were untrue or incomplete in any material respect, Cablevision would not be able to rely on the ruling. Furthermore, the IRS did not rule on whether the MSG Distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code. Rather, the ruling was based upon representations by Cablevision that these conditions were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling.\nIf the MSG Distribution does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, Cablevision would be subject to tax as if it had sold the common stock of our Company in a taxable sale for its fair market value. Cablevision\u2019s stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to Cablevision\u2019s stockholders and Cablevision would be substantial.\nAs part of the MSG Distribution we have entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with Cablevision (the \"MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement\"), which sets out each party\u2019s rights and obligations with respect to deficiencies and refunds, if any, of federal, state, local or foreign taxes for periods before and after the MSG Distribution and related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of IRS and other audits. Pursuant to the MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we are required to indemnify Cablevision for losses and tax liabilities of Cablevision that result from the breach of certain covenants that could cause the MSG Distribution to be treated as a taxable transaction. If we are required to indemnify Cablevision under the circumstances set forth in the MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe Are Controlled by the Dolan Family.\nWe have two classes of common stock:\n\u2022\nClass A Common Stock, which is entitled to one vote per share and is entitled collectively to elect 25% of our Board of Directors.\n\u2022\nClass B Common Stock, which is generally entitled to ten votes per share and is entitled collectively to elect the remaining 75% of our Board of Directors.\nAs of July 31, 2015, the Dolan family, including trusts for the benefit of members of the Dolan family, collectively own all of our Class B Common Stock, approximately 1.9% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock and approximately 69% of the total voting power of all our outstanding common stock. Of this amount, Charles F. Dolan, a director and the father of James L. Dolan, the Executive Chairman, and his spouse control approximately 59.4% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock, approximately 1% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock and approximately 41% of the total voting power of all our\noutstanding common stock. The members of the Dolan family holding Class B Common Stock have executed a voting agreement that has the effect of causing the voting power of the holders of our Class B Common Stock to be cast as a block with respect to all matters to be voted on by holders of Class B Common Stock. The Dolan family is able to prevent a change in control of our Company and no person interested in acquiring us will be able to do so without obtaining the consent of the Dolan family. Charles F. Dolan, members of his family and certain related family entities, by virtue of their stock ownership, have the power to elect all of our directors subject to election by holders of Class B Common Stock and are able collectively to control stockholder decisions on matters on which holders of all classes of our common stock vote together as a single class. These matters could include the amendment of some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the approval of fundamental corporate transactions.\nIn addition, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, is required to approve:\n\u2022\nthe authorization or issuance of any additional shares of Class B Common Stock, and\n\u2022\nany amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class B Common Stock.\nAs a result, Charles F. Dolan, members of his family and certain related family entities also collectively have the power to prevent such issuance or amendment.\nWe Have Elected to Be a \u201cControlled Company\u201d for New York Stock Exchange Purposes Which Allows Us Not to Comply with Certain of the Corporate Governance Rules of New York Stock Exchange.\nCharles F. Dolan, members of his family and certain related family entities have entered into a Stockholders Agreement relating, among other things, to the voting of their shares of our Class B Common Stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules of New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Our Board of Directors has elected for the Company to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NYSE corporate governance rules and not to comply with the NYSE requirement for a majority independent board of directors and for an independent corporate governance and nominating committee because of our status as a controlled company. Nevertheless, our Board of Directors has elected to comply with the NYSE requirement for an independent compensation committee.\nFuture Stock Sales, Including as a Result of the Exercise of Registration Rights by Certain of Our Stockholders, Could Adversely Affect the Trading Price of Our Class A Common Stock.\nCertain parties have registration rights covering a portion of our shares. We have entered into registration rights agreements with Charles F. Dolan, members of his family, certain Dolan family interests and the Dolan Family Foundations that provide them with \u201cdemand\u201d and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights with respect to approximately 15 million shares of Class A Common Stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of the Class A Common Stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities.\nTransfers and Ownership of Our Common Stock Are Subject to Restrictions Under Rules of the NBA and the NHL and Our Certificate of Incorporation Provides Us with Remedies Against Holders Who Do Not Comply with Those Restrictions.\nThe Company is the owner of professional sports franchises in the NBA and the NHL. As a result, transfers and ownership of our common stock are subject to certain restrictions under the constituent documents of the NBA and the NHL as well as the Company\u2019s consent agreements with the NBA and the NHL in connection with their approval of the MSG Distribution. These restrictions are described under \u201cDescription of Capital Stock - Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock - Transfer Restrictions\u201d in our registration statement on Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In order to protect the Company and its NBA and NHL franchises from sanctions that might be imposed by the NBA or the NHL as a result of violations of these restrictions, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, if a transfer of shares of our common stock to a person or the ownership of shares of our common stock by a person requires approval or other action by a league and such approval or other action was not obtained or taken as required, the Company shall have the right by written notice to the holder to require the holder to dispose of the shares of common stock which triggered the need for such approval. If a holder fails to comply with such a notice, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, the Company may redeem the shares at 85% of the fair market value of those shares.\nWe Share Certain Executives with Cablevision Which Means Those Executives Do Not Devote Their Full Time and Attention to Our Affairs and the Overlap May Give Rise to Conflicts; Certain Directors Are Also Directors and/or Executives of each of Cablevision and AMC Networks Inc. We Expect to Also Share Certain Executives and Directors with MSG Spinco if the Spinco Distribution Occurs.\nOur Executive Chairman, James L. Dolan, also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Cablevision. This arrangement is similar to the situation prior to the spin-off of the Company from Cablevision whereby Mr. Dolan served as an executive of both companies. As a result, he does not devote his full time and attention to the Company\u2019s affairs. In addition, our Vice Chairman, Gregg G. Seibert, also serves as the Vice Chairman of both Cablevision and AMC Networks. Furthermore, eight members of our Board of Directors are also directors of Cablevision, seven members of our Board of Directors are also directors of AMC Networks Inc., an affiliate of the Company, and several of our directors are employees or executives of Cablevision and AMC Networks Inc. concurrently with their service on our Board of Directors. These officers and directors may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting MSG and either Cablevision or AMC Networks Inc., as applicable. For example, the potential for a conflict of interest exists when we on the one hand, and Cablevision or AMC Networks Inc. on the other hand, look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both companies. Also, conflicts may arise if there are issues or disputes under the commercial arrangements that exist between Cablevision or AMC Networks Inc. and us. In addition, certain of our directors and officers have Cablevision and/or AMC Networks Inc. stock options and/or or cash performance awards, including Messrs. Charles F. Dolan, and James L. Dolan. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company and Cablevision or AMC Networks Inc. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Potential Conflicts of Interest\u201d in our Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2013 for a discussion of certain procedures we instituted to help ameliorate such potential conflicts with Cablevision and/or AMC Networks Inc. that may arise.\nWe also expect to have overlapping executive officers and directors with MSG Spinco following the Spinco Distribution, if consummated. James L. Dolan will serve as the Executive Chairman of both the Company and MSG Spinco and Lawrence J. Burian will serve as the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of both the Company and MSG Spinco. In addition, certain members of our Board of Directors, including James L. Dolan, will also serve as directors of MSG Spinco concurrently with their service on our Board of Directors.\nOur Overlapping Directors and Executive Officers with Cablevision and AMC Networks Inc., as Well as Our Overlapping Directors and Executive Officers with MSG Spinco if the Spinco Distribution Occurs, May Result in the Diversion of Corporate Opportunities and Other Conflicts to Cablevision and AMC Networks Inc. and Provisions in Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation May Provide Us No Remedy in That Circumstance.\nThe Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that directors and officers of the Company may also be serving as directors, officers, employees, consultants or agents of Cablevision and its subsidiaries and that the Company may engage in material business transactions with such entities. The Company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director or officer of the Company who is also serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or agent of Cablevision and its subsidiaries will be liable to the Company or its shareholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in our certificate of incorporation) to Cablevision or any of its subsidiaries instead of the Company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to the Company. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has adopted resolutions putting in place arrangements similar to the foregoing provisions on corporate opportunities with respect to directors and/or officers of the Company who are also directors and/or officers of AMC Networks Inc., a company which Cablevision spun off to its stockholders. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors expects to amend such policy to include directors and/or officers of the Company who are also directors and/or officers of MSG Spinco if the Spinco Distribution occurs. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also expressly validates certain contracts, agreements, assignments and transactions (and amendments, modifications or terminations thereof) between the Company and Cablevision and/or any of its subsidiaries and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the actions of the overlapping directors or officers in connection therewith are not breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective shareholders. See \u201cDescription of Capital Stock - Certain Corporate Opportunities and Conflicts\u201d in our registration statement on Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisks Relating to the Impact of the Potential Spin-off Transaction\nIf the Spinco Distribution is Consummated, We Will Incur Substantial Indebtedness and Become Highly Leveraged, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nHistorically, our debt levels have been relatively low and thus we did not have substantial interest expense. However, we anticipate that immediately prior to the Spinco Distribution, if consummated, we will incur substantial debt, substantially all of the proceeds of which will be contributed to MSG Spinco. We may also continue to incur additional debt in the future. Because of this increased indebtedness, we will become highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged. As a result, our interest and principal payments on our borrowings are expected to increase substantially and become significant in relation to our revenues and cash flows. These payments will reduce our earnings and cash available for other potential business purposes. This leverage also exposes us to significant risk in the event of downturns in our businesses (whether through competitive pressure or otherwise), or in the economy generally. Although our cash flows would decrease in this scenario, our required payments in respect of indebtedness would not decrease.\nIn addition, our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, such debt, and to fund capital expenditures, will depend largely upon our future operating performance. Our future operating performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our future operating performance may be adversely impacted by loss of earnings from the MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment businesses that will belong to MSG Spinco following the Spinco Distribution and from the additional operating expenses we will incur following the Spinco Distribution, including under the Media Rights Agreements discussed below.\nThe Spinco Distribution, if Consummated, Could Result in Significant Tax Liability.\nWe expect to obtain an opinion from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Spinco Distribution will qualify as a tax-free distribution under the Code. The opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. Additionally, we have received a private letter ruling from the IRS concluding that certain limited aspects of the Spinco Distribution will not prevent the Spinco Distribution from satisfying certain requirements for tax-free treatment under the Code. While certain transactions related to the Spinco Distribution that are not addressed (or expected to be addressed) by either the opinion or the private letter ruling could result in the recognition of income or gain by us, the impact of any such resulting tax is not expected to be material to us. The opinion and the private letter ruling will rely on factual representations and reasonable assumptions, which if incorrect or inaccurate may jeopardize the ability to rely on such opinion and letter ruling.\nIf the Spinco Distribution does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the MSG Spinco common stock in a taxable sale for its fair value. MSG stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair value of MSG Spinco common stock that was distributed to them, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of our earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of each holder\u2019s tax basis in its MSG common stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to MSG stockholders and us would be substantial.\nThe Tax Rules Applicable to the Spinco Distribution, if Consummated, May Restrict us From Engaging in Certain Corporate Transactions or From Raising Equity Capital Beyond Certain Thresholds for a Period of Time After the Spinco Distribution.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spinco Distribution to our and MSG Spinco\u2019s stockholders, under a tax disaffiliation agreement that would be entered into between the Company and MSG Spinco, for the two-year period following the Spinco Distribution, we will be subject to restrictions with respect to our activities, including restrictions relating to certain issuances or repurchases of our common stock, asset sales, mergers and liquidations.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability during that two-year period to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of our stock or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might increase the value of our business. These restrictions may also limit our ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of stock, especially if our stock price were to suffer substantial declines, or through the sale of certain of our assets.\nWe May Not Enjoy All the Benefits of Scale that We Achieved Prior to the Spinco Distribution, if Consummated.\nIf the Spinco Distribution is consummated, following the Spinco Distribution we will no longer share with MSG Spinco the benefits of scope and scale in administrative and other overhead costs and expenses resulting from various factors, including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), tax administration, legal and human resources related functions. While we expect to enter into agreements with MSG Spinco that govern a number of our commercial and other relationships after the Spinco Distribution, those arrangements will not fully capture the benefits we currently enjoy as a result of the common ownership of the MSG Media, MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment businesses.\nIf the Spinco Distribution Occurs, We Will Rely on MSG Spinco\u2019s Performance Under Various Agreements, and Particularly the Media Rights Agreements and Advertising Sales Representation Agreement.\nIf the Spinco Distribution occurs, we expect to enter into various agreements with MSG Spinco, including a distribution agreement, a tax disaffiliation agreement, a transition services agreement, an employee matters agreement, an advertising sales representation agreement and the media rights agreements, as well as certain other arrangements. These agreements will govern our relationship with MSG Spinco subsequent to the Spinco Distribution and will provide for the allocation of employee benefits, taxes and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Spinco Distribution. These agreements will also include arrangements with respect to transition services and a number of on-going commercial relationships. Under the distribution agreement we will provide MSG Spinco with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of our businesses and MSG Spinco will provide us with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of its businesses we will transfer to MSG Spinco. We and MSG Spinco will each rely on the other to perform its obligations under all of these agreements. If MSG Spinco were to breach or to be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification or other financial obligations, we could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.\nIn connection with the Spinco Distribution, We Will Enter Into Media Rights Agreements with MSG Spinco Which Will Require Rights Fee Payments That Substantially Exceed the Inter-Segment Rights Fee Expense Reflected in Our Historical Financial Statements.\nIn connection with the Spinco Distribution, we will enter into media rights agreements covering the Knicks and the Rangers. These agreements will provide us with the exclusive media rights to team games.
