{"cik": "1124804", "company": "ALLSCRIPTS HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and stock price can be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including, but not limited to, those described below. Any one or more of such factors, some of which are outside of our control, could directly or indirectly cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from our past or anticipated future financial condition or operating results.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThese risk factors may be important to understanding any statement made by us in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact the business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of us and our clients.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have had a significant, ongoing impact on our operations and the operations of our healthcare clients. The magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Because our hospital and other health care provider clients have understandably prioritized their resources, capacity and staff as the COVID-19 outbreak continues to strain their organizations, we expect that our business will continue to be adversely affected, including by negatively impacting the demand and timing for implementing our solutions and the timing of payment for our solutions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, as we saw continued delays in deals with upfront software revenue and professional services implementations across our inpatient and outpatient base. We are unable to predict the continuing magnitude of any such effect.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instituted a work-from-home policy for most of our employees and have limited employee travel to essential travel only, which has restricted some sales, marketing and other important business activities. In addition, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused continued volatility in financial and other capital markets which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, additional \u201cwaves\u201d of outbreaks and variants of the virus, the impact of the pandemic on economic activity, and the actions taken by health authorities and policy makers to contain its impacts on public health and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below, such as those relating to our products and services, sales cycles and implementation schedules, the retention of key employees, financial performance and debt obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nMarkets for our products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and we may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly evolving technology, solution standards and user needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. Some of our competitors may be more established, benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of potential incentives provided by government programs and as a result of consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries.\nWe compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022breadth and depth of services, including our open architecture and the level of product integration across care settings;\n\u2022integrated platform;\n\u2022regulatory compliance;\n\u2022reputation;\n\u2022reliability, accuracy and security;\n\u2022client service;\n\u2022total cost of ownership;\n\u2022innovation; and\n\u2022industry acceptance, expertise and experience.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures that we face will not materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMany healthcare provider organizations are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. As provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate, thus decreasing the number of market participants, competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense, and the importance of establishing and maintaining relationships with key industry participants will increase. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services. Further, consolidation of management and billing services through integrated delivery systems may decrease demand for our products. Such consolidation may also lead integrated delivery systems to require newly acquired physician practices to replace their current Allscripts EHR product with that already in use in the larger enterprise. Any of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to a number of existing laws, regulations and industry initiatives, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and relationships, and those of our clients, are regulated by a number of foreign, federal, state and local governmental entities. The impact of this regulation on us is direct, to the extent we are ourselves subject to these laws and regulations, and is also indirect, both in terms of the level of government reimbursement available to our clients and in that, in a number of situations, even if we are not directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our clients in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations. The ability of our clients to comply with laws and regulations while using our solutions could affect the marketability of our products or our compliance with our client contracts, or even expose us to direct liability under the theory that we had assisted our clients in a violation of healthcare laws or regulations. Because our business relationships with physicians, hospitals and other provider clients are unique and the healthcare IT industry as a whole is relatively young, the application of many state and federal regulations to our business operations and to our clients is uncertain. It is possible that a review of our business practices or those of our clients by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect us. See the risk factor entitled \u201cThe failure by Practice Fusion to comply with the terms of its settlement agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and, even if Practice Fusion complies with those settlement agreements, the costs and burdens of compliance could be significant, and we may face additional investigations and proceedings from other governmental entities or third parties related to the same or similar conduct underlying the agreements with the DOJ.\u201d Furthermore, as we expand our business globally, we become subject to comparable laws and regulations in each non-United States jurisdiction in which we operate, which creates additional risks. See the risk factor entitled \u201cOur business is subject to the risks of global operations.\u201d\nSpecific risks include, but are not limited to:\nHealthcare Fraud. Federal and state governments continue to enhance regulation of and increase their scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud perpetrated by healthcare providers and professionals whose services are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Any determination by a regulatory, prosecutorial or judicial authority that any of our activities involving our clients, vendors or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund a portion of our license or service fees or disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory or prosecutorial authorities could result in adverse publicity, require a costly response from us and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nPatient Information. Our business is subject to rules, particularly HIPAA and HITECH, and contractual obligations relating to the privacy and security of PHI that we and our subcontractors may have access to as part of the operation of our business. These rules and obligations have increased the cost of compliance and could subject us to additional enforcement actions and contractual liability, which could further increase our costs and adversely affect the way in which we do business.\nThe penalties for a violation of HIPAA or HITECH are significant and could have an adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and operating results, if such penalties ever were imposed. If we or our subcontractors do not follow procedures and policies for the handling of PHI, or if those procedures and policies are not sufficient to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of PHI, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal liability, fines and lawsuits, termination of our client contracts or our operations could be shut down. Moreover, because all HIPAA standards and HITECH implementing regulations and guidance are subject to change or interpretation, we cannot predict the full future impact of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations on our business and operations. Additionally, certain state privacy laws are not preempted by HIPAA and HITECH and may impose\nindependent obligations upon our clients or us. Additional legislation governing the acquisition, storage and transmission or other dissemination of health record information and other personal information, including social security numbers and other identifiers, continues to be proposed and come into force at the state level. There can be no assurance that changes to state or federal laws will not materially restrict the ability of providers to submit information from patient records using our products and services.\nElectronic Prescribing. The use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions, including electronic prescribing, which refers to the electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and the ensuing dispensation, is governed by state and federal law, including fraud and abuse laws. States have differing prescription format requirements, which we have programmed into our software. There is significant variation in the laws and regulations governing prescription activity, as federal law and the laws of many states permit the electronic transmission of certain controlled prescription orders, while the laws of several states neither specifically permit nor specifically prohibit the practice. Restrictions exist at the federal level on the use of electronic prescribing for controlled substances and certain other drugs. However, some states (most notably New York) have passed complementary laws governing the use of electronic prescribing tools in the use of prescribing opioids and other controlled substances, and we expect this to continue to be addressed with regulations in other states. In general, regulations in this area impose certain requirements which can be burdensome and evolve regularly and may adversely affect our business model.\nElectronic Health Records. A number of important federal and state laws governing the use and content of EHRs may affect the design of such technology. As a company that provides EHRs to a variety of providers of healthcare, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients\u2019 compliance with these laws. We cannot predict the content or effect of possible changes to these laws or new federal and state laws that might govern these systems and services. We may also be subject to future legislation and regulations concerning the development and marketing of healthcare software systems or requirements related to product functionality. These could increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable. Furthermore, several of our products are certified by an ONC-approved certifying body as meeting the standards for functionality, interoperability and security under HITECH. Our failure to maintain this certification or otherwise meet industry standards could adversely impact our business.\nHITECH identified the \u201cmeaningful use\u201d of interoperable EHRs throughout the United States health care delivery system as a critical national goal. By using certified EHR technology and submitting information on the quality of care and other measures to the Secretary of Health & Human Services, eligible healthcare professionals and hospitals have been able to qualify for an additional Medicare and Medicaid payment for the Meaningful Use of certified EHR technology that meets specified objectives under the EHR Incentive program. If our clients do not receive or lose expected payments from other incentive or pay for value programs, this could harm their willingness to purchase future products or upgrades, and therefore could have an adverse effect on our future revenues.\nClaims Transmission. Our system electronically transmits medical claims by physicians to patients\u2019 payers for approval and reimbursement. In addition, we offer revenue cycle management services that include the manual and electronic processing and submission of medical claims by physicians to patients\u2019 payers for approval and reimbursement. Federal law provides that it is both a civil and a criminal violation for any person to submit, or cause to be submitted, a claim to any payer, including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid and all private health plans and managed care plans, seeking payment for any services or products that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient. We have in place policies and procedures that we believe assure that all claims that are transmitted by our system and through our services are accurate and complete, provided that the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete. If, however, we or our subcontractors do not follow those procedures and policies, or they are not sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims from being submitted, we could be subject to liability.\nMedical Devices. Certain computer software products are regulated as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Cures Act, passed in December 2016, clarified the definition of a medical device to exclude health information technology such as EHRs; however, the legislation did leave the opportunity for that designation to be revisited if determined to be necessary by changing industry and technological dynamics. Accordingly, the Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) may become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings. Depending on the product, we could be required to notify the FDA and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing such products or obtain FDA approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing a product. Depending on the intended use of a device, the FDA could require us to obtain extensive data from clinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness or substantial equivalence. If the FDA requires this data, we could be required to obtain approval of an investigational device exemption before undertaking clinical trials. Clinical trials can take extended periods of time to complete. We cannot provide assurances that the FDA would approve or clear a device after the completion of such trials. In addition, these products would be subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act\u2019s general controls. The FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions such as approval, labeling and manufacturing, as well as governing product design controls and quality assurance processes. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can result in criminal and civil fines and penalties, product seizure, injunction and civil monetary policies-each of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIncreased government involvement in healthcare could materially and adversely impact our business.\nUnited States healthcare system reform at both the federal and state level could increase government involvement in healthcare, reconfigure reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of our clients and the other entities with which we\nhave a business relationship. We cannot predict whether or when future healthcare reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed, enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business, financial condition or operating results. Our clients and the other entities with which we have a business relationship could react to these initiatives and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our products and services.\nAdditionally, government regulation could alter the clinical workflow of physicians, hospitals and other healthcare participants, thereby limiting the utility of our products and services to existing and potential clients and curtailing broad acceptance of our products and services. Further examples of government involvement could include requiring the standardization of technology relating to EHRs, providing clients with incentives to adopt EHR solutions or developing a low-cost government-sponsored EHR solution, or increased enforcement activity targeting healthcare fraud and abuse.\nChanges in interoperability and other regulatory standards applicable to our software could require us to incur substantial additional development costs.\nOur clients and the industry leaders enacting regulatory requirements are concerned with, and often require, that our software solutions be interoperable with other third-party health IT suppliers. Market forces or governmental authorities have created and could continue to create software interoperability standards that could apply to our solutions, and if our applicable products or services are not consistent with those standards, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development costs and delays may result in connection therewith. If our applicable products or services are not consistent with these varying and evolving standards or do not support our clients in their efforts to meet new certification requirements, our market position and sales could be adversely affected, and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our software solutions, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe could fail to maintain and expand our business with our existing clients or effectively transition our clients to newer products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had one client that accounted for 12% of our revenue. Our business model depends on our success with maintaining our existing clients, particularly our significant clients, and selling new and incremental products and services to these existing clients. In addition, our success with certain clients requires our achieving interoperability between our new products and our legacy products to provide a single solution that connects healthcare providers across care settings. Certain of our clinical solutions clients initially purchase one or a limited number of our products and services. These clients may choose not to expand their use of, or purchase, additional modules. Also, as we deploy new applications and features for our existing solutions or introduce new solutions and services, our current clients could choose not to purchase these new offerings. If we fail to generate additional business from our current clients, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease.\nIn addition, the transition of our existing clients to current versions of our products presents certain risks, including the risk of data loss or corruption or delays in completion. If such events occur, our client relationships and reputation could be damaged. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur products or services could fail to perform properly due to errors or similar problems.\nComplex technology, such as ours, often contains defects or errors, some of which may remain undetected for a period of time. It is possible that such errors may be found after the introduction of new products or services or enhancements to existing products or services. We continually introduce new solutions and enhancements to our solutions and, despite testing by us, it is possible that errors may occur in our software or offerings. If we detect any errors before we introduce a solution, we may have to delay deployment for an extended period of time while we address the problem. If we do not discover errors that affect our new or current solutions or enhancements until after they are deployed, we would need to provide enhancements to correct such errors. Errors in our products or services could result in:\n\u2022product-related liabilities, fraud and abuse or patient safety issues;\n\u2022unexpected expenses and liability and diversion of resources to remedy errors;\n\u2022harm to our reputation;\n\u2022lost sales;\n\u2022delays in commercial releases;\n\u2022delays in or loss of market acceptance of our solutions;\n\u2022license termination or renegotiations; and\n\u2022privacy and/or security vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, our clients may use our products or services together with products or services from other companies or those that they have developed internally. As a result, when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our products or services do not cause these problems, the existence of these errors may cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our other solution development efforts, impact our reputation and cause significant issues with our client relationships.\nWe could be subject to liability as a result of information security breaches, and clients could be deterred from using our products and services.\nOur business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including PHI, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our clients, company and workforce. As a result, we face risk of deliberate or unintentional incidents involving unauthorized access to our computer systems or data that could result in the misappropriation or loss of assets or the disclosure of sensitive information, the corruption of data, or other disruption of our business operations. We believe that companies in our industry may continue to be targeted by such events with increasing frequency due to the value of healthcare-related data. Any future denial-of-service, ransomware or other Internet-based attacks may range from mere vandalism of our electronic systems to systematic theft of sensitive information and intellectual property. For example, in 2018 we were subject to a ransomware attack that impacted two of our data centers, resulting in outages that left certain of our solutions offline for our clients. As another example, we learned that a third party obtained unauthorized access to personally identifiable information stored in our computer systems. The means of such access was removed, and we have no indication that the information was distributed or used. Although we have systems in place that we believe are reasonably designed to prevent and detect security breaches, we cannot be certain that this or any future breach or incident will not materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe have devoted and continue to devote significant resources to protecting and maintaining the confidentiality of this information, including designing and implementing security and privacy programs and controls, training our workforce and implementing new technology. We have no guarantee that these programs and controls will be adequate to prevent all possible security threats. Any compromise of our electronic systems, including the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of sensitive information or a significant disruption of our computing assets and networks, could adversely affect our reputation or our ability to fulfill contractual obligations, could require us to devote significant financial and other resources to mitigate such problems, and could increase our future cyber security costs, including through organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, further training of employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants. Moreover, unauthorized access, use or disclosure of such sensitive information, including any resulting from the incidents described above, could result in civil or criminal liability or regulatory action, including potential fines and penalties. In addition, any real or perceived compromise of our security or disclosure of sensitive information may deter clients from using or purchasing our products and services in the future, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nWe use third-party contractors to store, transmit and host sensitive information for our clients. Additionally, Allscripts uses third-party software and components to develop solutions and provide services to its clients. While we have contractual or other mechanisms in place with these third-party contractors and software and component suppliers that require them to have appropriate security programs and controls in place and, frequently, to indemnify us for security-related breaches, any compromise or failure of these contractors\u2019 or supply chain privacy and security practices could adversely affect our reputation, require us to devote financial and other resources to mitigate these breaches, or subject us to litigation from our clients or shareholders, as well as actions by regulatory agencies.\nCompanies, including Allscripts, and governmental agencies have experienced high profile incidents involving data security breaches by entities that transmit and store sensitive information. Lawsuits resulting from these and other similar security breaches have sought very significant monetary damages. While we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of security-related risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in our business, and we cannot provide assurance that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms.\nThe failure by Practice Fusion to comply with the terms of its settlement agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and, even if Practice Fusion complies with those settlement agreements, the costs and burdens of compliance could be significant, and we may face additional investigations and proceedings from other governmental entities or third parties related to the same or similar conduct underlying the agreements with the DOJ.\nOn January 27, 2020, we announced that our subsidiary Practice Fusion entered into a series of agreements to resolve an investigation conducted by the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont. See the risk factor entitled \u201cWe have acquired and expect to acquire new companies, investments or technologies, and we have also completed certain asset or business dispositions, each of which is subject to significant risks.\u201d Practice Fusion has entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont (\u201cDeferred Prosecution Agreement\u201d) and a civil settlement agreement with the DOJ (\u201cCivil Settlement Agreement\u201d), and has entered into separate civil settlement agreements with the Medicaid programs for each U.S. state, the\nDistrict of Columbia and Puerto Rico (\u201cState Settlement Agreements\u201d and, together with the Deferred Prosecution Agreement and the Civil Settlement Agreement, the \u201cSettlement Agreements\u201d).\nUnder the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, Practice Fusion consented to the filing of a two count criminal information: one felony count of violating the Anti-Kickback Statute and one felony count of conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement required Practice Fusion to pay a criminal fine of $25.3 million and a forfeiture payment of $959,700, both of which have been paid in full, and required the Company and Practice Fusion to regularly review and certify compliance with the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. Practice Fusion also agreed to implement Additional Civil Compliance Terms, which include the appointment of an Oversight Organization and the implementation of compliance measures set forth in a Compliance Addendum, each as described further in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The Oversight Organization Mandate requires Practice Fusion to retain an Oversight Organization selected by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Vermont for three years. The Oversight Organization is required to take steps to provide reasonable assurance that Practice Fusion establishes and maintains compliance systems, controls and processes reasonably designed, implemented and operated to ensure Practice Fusion\u2019s compliance with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, including the Compliance Addendum, as well as reducing the risk of any recurrence of misconduct as described in the information and statement of facts. The Compliance Addendum also required Practice Fusion to, within 90 days of the execution of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, implement and maintain a Sponsored Clinical Decision Support (\u201cCDS\u201d) Compliance Program that sets procedures and systems to review all current or future Sponsored CDSs on the Practice Fusion EHR system. Practice Fusion is subject to the Compliance Addendum for a three-year period from the effective date of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement.\nPractice Fusion also entered into the Civil Settlement Agreement to resolve allegations by the DOJ that false claims were submitted to governmental healthcare programs. The Civil Settlement Agreement required Practice Fusion to pay a civil settlement of $118.6 million, which included $5.2 million designated for the state Medicaid program expenditures and has been paid in full. In addition, Practice Fusion entered into the State Settlement Agreements to resolve Medicaid claims under state law analogues to the federal False Claims Act. The financial terms of the State Settlement Agreements are substantially similar to those set forth in the Civil Settlement Agreement.\nSee Note 22, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nCompliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreements has imposed and could continue to impose significant costs and burdens on us. If we fail to comply with any such Settlement Agreement, the DOJ may impose substantial monetary penalties, exclude Practice Fusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and/or criminally prosecute Practice Fusion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. On August 17, 2021, Practice Fusion's initial Oversight Organization resigned, and on August 25, 2021, Practice Fusion received a notice from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Vermont stating Practice Fusion was in breach of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement due to such resignation. On September 17, 2021, Practice Fusion engaged a new Oversight Organization, and in February, 2022, Practice Fusion reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Vermont to resolve the matter without finding of a breach.\nOther government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including investigations or proceedings brought by private litigants or shareholders, federal agencies, private insurers and states\u2019 attorneys general, have followed as a consequence of our entry into the Settlement Agreement or the existing government investigation of our EIS Business, which could result in criminal liability, the imposition of damages or non-monetary relief, significant compliance, litigation or settlement costs, other losses, or a diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also be subject to negative publicity related to these matters that could harm our reputation, reduce demand for our solutions and services, result in employee attrition and negatively impact our stock price.\nWe have acquired and expect to acquire new companies, investments or technologies, and we have also completed certain asset or business dispositions, each of which is subject to significant risks.\nWe have recently made investments in, or acquisitions or dispositions of, businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and other intellectual property rights. We expect that we will continue to take strategic portfolio actions in the future.\nOur investments and acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the investment or acquisition, including the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs, or the inability to achieve expected synergies or cost savings;\n\u2022unanticipated expenses related to acquired businesses or technologies;\n\u2022the diversion of financial, managerial and other resources from existing operations;\n\u2022the risks of entering into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger positions;\n\u2022unanticipated regulatory and other compliance risks related to acquired companies or technologies;\n\u2022potential write-offs or amortization of acquired assets or investments;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees, clients or partners of an acquired business;\n\u2022delays in client purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with an investment or acquisition; and\n\u2022the tax effects of any such acquisitions.\nDispositions are also subject to many risks, including potential negative impacts to the Company's earnings and risks relating to transition service or other post-disposition obligations, as well as the diversion of management's attention.\nPrior to their acquisition by us, the Enterprise Information Solutions business acquired from McKesson Corporation (the \u201cEIS Business\u201d) received a request for documents and information from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office pursuant to a civil investigative demand (a \u201cCID\u201d). The CID relates to the certification of the business\u2019s software under the ONC\u2019s EHR certification program and related business practices. In August 2018, an additional CID sought similar information related to a separate EIS Business solution. If either CID leads to a claim or legal proceeding against us or our businesses that results in the imposition of damages, non-monetary relief, significant compliance, litigation or settlement costs or any other losses, in each case for which we are not indemnified by the seller of the acquired business, or are otherwise unable to recover against the seller, such damages, relief, costs or losses could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, prior to their acquisition by us, Practice Fusion received a request for documents and information from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Vermont pursuant to a CID. Subsequent to their acquisition by us, Practice Fusion received additional requests for documents and information pursuant to additional CIDs and HIPAA subpoenas. These requests related to the certification of Practice Fusion\u2019s software under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Electronic Health Record Incentive Program, compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, and related business practices. On January 27, 2020, Practice Fusion entered into a series of agreements to resolve these investigations. See risk factor entitled \u201cThe failure by Practice Fusion to comply with the terms of its settlement agreements with the DOJ could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and, even if Practice Fusion complies with those settlement agreements, the costs and burdens of compliance could be significant, and we may face additional investigations and proceedings from other governmental entities or third parties related to the same or similar conduct underlying the agreements with the DOJ.\u201d\nFurthermore, the success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate our existing businesses with those of the acquired businesses, including the integration of employees, products and technologies. These integrations are inherently complex, costly and time-consuming processes and involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to, unanticipated expenses and the diversion of financial, managerial and other resources from both our existing operations and those of the acquired businesses. The integration of foreign acquisitions presents additional challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages, as well as currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions, investments or dispositions, or if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses or investments, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce the Company's earnings.\nFinally, if we finance acquisitions or investments by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligations related to the incurrence of indebtedness. This could materially and adversely impact our stock price.\nThe realignment of our sales, services and support organizations could adversely affect client relationships and affect our future growth.\nWe periodically make adjustments to our sales, services and support organizations in response to market opportunities, management changes, product introductions and other internal and external considerations. These changes could result in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity. In addition, these adjustments could result in our clients experiencing a change in our employees with whom they interact. Any of these changes could adversely impact individual client relationships, client retention, and sales of products and services to existing clients. It is also possible that these changes could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services to new clients. Any such events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur clients may not accept our products and services or may delay decisions whether to purchase our products and services.\nOur business model depends on our ability to sell our products and services. Acceptance of our products and services may require our clients to adopt different behavior patterns and new methods of conducting business and exchanging information. We cannot provide assurance that our clients will integrate our products and services into their workflow or that participants in the healthcare market will accept our products and services as a replacement for traditional methods of conducting healthcare transactions. Achieving market acceptance for our products and services will require substantial sales and marketing efforts and the expenditure of\nsignificant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry. If we fail to achieve broad market acceptance of our products and services, or if we fail to position our services as a preferred method for information management and healthcare delivery, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted.\nIt is difficult to predict the sales cycle and implementation schedule for our products and services.\nThe duration of the sales cycle and implementation schedule for our products and services depends on a number of factors, including the nature and size of the potential client and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential client, all of which may be difficult to predict. Our sales and marketing efforts with respect to hospitals and large health organizations generally involve a lengthy sales cycle due to these organizations\u2019 complex decision-making processes. Additionally, in light of increased government involvement in healthcare and related changes in the operating environment for healthcare organizations, our current and potential clients may react by reducing or deferring investments, including their purchases of our solutions or services. If clients take longer than we expect to decide whether to purchase our solutions, our selling expenses could increase and our revenues could decrease, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. If clients take longer than we expect to implement our solutions, our recognition of related revenue would be delayed, which could also materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe implementation of large and complex contracts requires us to devote sufficient personnel, systems, equipment, technology and other resources necessary to ensure a timely and successful implementation, which may in turn reduce the amount of resources available to successfully bid for and implement other new customer contracts. If we fail to implement large and complex contracts successfully and in a timely manner, or if as a result of resource constraints, we fail to properly implement other new customer contracts, we may face significant challenges that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to grow, and if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our clients\u2019 requirements.\nWe will need to expand our operations if we successfully achieve market acceptance for our products and services. We cannot be certain that our systems, procedures, controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations. Our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage changing business conditions and to effectively maintain and improve our technical, administrative, financial control and reporting systems. We may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases. Difficulties in managing any future growth, including as a result of integrating any prior or future acquisition with our existing businesses, could cause us to incur unexpected expenses, render us unable to meet our clients\u2019 requirements, and consequently could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are working to expand our operations in markets outside of the United States. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Expansion of our global sales and operations may require us to divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and could result in significant expense to us, which could materially and adversely impact our operating results.\nWe may be unable to successfully introduce new products or services or fail to keep pace with advances in technology.\nThe successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to evolving technologies and increasingly aggressive industry standards and introduce new products and services accordingly. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to introduce new products on schedule, or at all, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. Moreover, competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect our operating results. Any failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and operating results.\nIf we cannot adapt to changing technologies or are unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential clients' or users' requirements, our products and services may become obsolete and our business could suffer. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services, develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective clients and users, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices, all on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving client or user requirements or emerging industry standards. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to establish and maintain additional strategic relationships.\nTo be successful, we must continue to maintain our existing strategic relationships and establish additional strategic relationships with leaders in a number of the markets in which we operate. This is critical to our success because we believe that these relationships contribute to our ability to:\n\u2022extend the reach of our products and services to a larger number of physicians and hospitals and to other participants in the healthcare industry;\n\u2022develop and deploy new products and services;\n\u2022further enhance our brand; and\n\u2022generate additional revenue and cash flows.\nEntering into strategic relationships is complicated because strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of the markets in which we operate. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or establish relationships with key participants in the healthcare industry if we conduct business with their competitors.\nWe depend, in part, on our strategic partners\u2019 ability to generate increased acceptance and use of our products and services. If we lose any of these strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships, or if our strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected, this could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unable to protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property rights.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets to us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For instance, any of our current or future intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all.\nWe have taken efforts to protect our proprietary rights, including a combination of license agreements, confidentiality policies and procedures, confidentiality provisions in employment agreements, confidentiality agreements with third parties, and technical security measures, as well as our reliance on copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and unfair competition laws. These efforts may not be sufficient or effective. For example, the secrecy of our trade secrets or other confidential information could be compromised by our employees or by third parties, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets or that confidential information. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise infringe upon, misappropriate or use our intellectual property. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We may also conclude that, in some instances, the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense.\nIn addition, our platforms incorporate \u201copen source\u201d software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses. Open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses. Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown. Further, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use cloud-based services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nLegal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and evolving. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed.\nAny impairment of our intellectual property rights, or our failure to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, could give our competitors access to our technology and could materially and adversely impact our business and operating results. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and result in significant additional expense to us, which could materially and adversely impact our operating results. Finally, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, including with respect to legal proceedings, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings and claims, such as being found to have infringed on a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved, including the CIDs discussed under Note 22, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K, and additional claims may arise in the future. For example, companies in our industry, including many of our competitors, have been subject to litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In particular, patent holding companies often engage in litigation seeking to monetize patents that they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As the number of competitors, patents and patent holding companies in our industry increases, the functionality of our products and services expands, and as we enter into new geographies and markets, the number of intellectual property rights-related actions against us has increased and is likely to continue to increase. We are vigorously defending against these actions in a number of jurisdictions.\nIf we are found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringing technology, we may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party, and we may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products or services. Furthermore, certain of our agreements require us to indemnify our clients and third-party service providers for third party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the costs to us of an adverse ruling on such claims and could adversely impact our relationships with our clients and third party service providers. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These license agreements may also significantly increase our operating expenses.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, legal proceedings may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to our management. If one or more legal matters were resolved against or settled by us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially and adversely impacted. Such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or other monetary damages; disgorgement of revenue or profits; remedial corporate measures; or other injunctive or equitable relief against us, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe maintain insurance coverage that may apply in the event we are involved in a legal proceeding or claim. This coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more claims against us, and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products or services. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. This could increase the magnitude of the impact of one or more legal proceedings or claims being resolved against or settled by us.\nOur exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property, or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks, with respect to the acquired company or its technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement or related claims after we have acquired companies that had not been asserted prior to the acquisition.\nOur success depends on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\nMuch of our future performance depends on the continued availability and service of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer and our President, the other members of our senior management team, and our other highly qualified personnel, as well as being able to hire additional highly qualified personnel who have a deep understanding of our industry. Competition in our industry for such personnel, especially with respect to sales and technical personnel, is intense. We are required to expend significant resources on identifying, hiring, developing, motivating and retaining such personnel throughout our organization. Many of the companies with whom we compete for such personnel have greater resources than us and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. Our investment in training and developing our employees makes them more attractive to our clients and competitors, who may then seek to recruit them. Furthermore, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our failure to attract new highly qualified personnel, or our failure to retain and motivate our existing key personnel, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur independent content and service providers may fail to perform adequately or comply with laws, regulations or contractual covenants.\nWe depend on independent content and service providers for communications and information services and for some of the benefits we provide through our software applications and services, including the maintenance of managed care pharmacy guidelines, drug interaction reviews, the routing of transaction data to third-party payers and the hosting of our applications. Our ability to rely on these services could be impaired as a result of the failure of such providers to comply with applicable laws, regulations and contractual covenants or as a result of events affecting such providers, such as power loss, telecommunication failures, software or hardware errors, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems, fire, flood and natural disasters. Any such failure or event could adversely affect our relationships with our clients and damage our reputation. This could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have no means of replacing content or services on a timely basis or at all if they are inadequate or in the event of a service interruption or failure. We also rely on independent content providers for the majority of the clinical, educational and other healthcare information that we provide. In addition, we depend on our content providers to deliver high quality content from reliable sources and to continually upgrade their content in response to demand and evolving healthcare industry trends. If these parties fail to develop and maintain high quality, attractive content, the value of our brand and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe may be liable for use of content we provide.\nWe provide content for use by healthcare providers in treating patients. Third-party content suppliers provide certain of this content. If this content is incorrect or incomplete, adverse consequences, including death, may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us. In addition, certain of our solutions provide applications that relate to patient clinical information, and a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly, including through licensed\npractitioners, or delivery of information by a third party site that a consumer accesses through our websites, exposes us to personal injury liability, or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information. While we maintain insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business, we cannot provide assurance that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A claim that is brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources.\nChanges to the healthcare regulatory landscape could force us to reduce our prices.\nWe may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to our future sales arising from various sources, including practices of managed care organizations, group purchasing arrangements made through government programs such as the Regional Extension Centers, and government action affecting reimbursement levels related to physicians, hospitals, home health professionals or any combination thereof under Medicare, Medicaid and other government health programs. Our clients and the other entities with which we have a business relationship are affected by changes in statutes, regulations and limitations in governmental spending for Medicare, Medicaid and other programs. Recent government actions and future legislative and administrative changes could limit government spending for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, limit payments to hospitals and other providers, increase emphasis on competition, impose price controls, initiate new and expanded value-based reimbursement programs and create other programs that potentially could have an adverse effect on our clients and the other entities with which we have a business relationship. If our pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business will be less profitable and our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to license and integrate third-party technologies could harm our business.\nWe depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our solutions from third-party vendors and intend to continue licensing technologies from third parties. These technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. Our inability to obtain, maintain or comply with any of these licenses could delay development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMost of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive, and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own solutions.\nOur business is subject to the risks of global operations.\nWe operate in several countries outside of the United States, including significant operations in Canada, India, Israel, the UK and Australia, and we are further expanding our global sales efforts. This subjects our business to risks and challenges associated with operating globally, which include:\n\u2022changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;\n\u2022natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches;\n\u2022different employee/employer relationships, existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that may prevent us from repatriating, or make it cost-prohibitive for us to repatriate, cash earned in countries outside of the United States;\n\u2022import and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers;\n\u2022longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022uncertainty regarding liability for our products and services, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent;\n\u2022different or lesser protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022different legal and regulatory requirements that may apply to our products and/or how we operate; and\n\u2022localization of our products and services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses.\nAll of the foregoing risks could prevent or restrict us from offering products or services to a particular market, could increase our operating costs, and could otherwise materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, our compliance with complex foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our global operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy requirements, anti-corruption laws (such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, and antitrust and competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in, among other things, fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also affect our global expansion efforts, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or distributors, or third parties with whom we do business, will not violate our policies. Furthermore, potential changes in data privacy and protection requirements may increase our future legal and regulatory compliance burden.\nFinally, since we conduct business in currencies other than the United States dollar, but report our financial results in United States dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the United States dollar and foreign currencies may make our products and services more expensive for our global clients, or otherwise materially and adversely impact our operating results. We may occasionally hedge our global currency exposure; however, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Indebtedness\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock, and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and debt instruments contain anti-takeover provisions.\nOur Board of Directors (our \u201cBoard\u201d) has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences, rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. In the event that we issue shares of preferred stock in the future that have preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue shares of preferred stock that are convertible into our common stock at greater than a one-to-one ratio, the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock or our stock price could be materially and adversely impacted. The ability of our Board to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that certain of our stockholders may deem advantageous, which could lower our stock price.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that certain of our stockholders may deem advantageous, which could lower our stock price. These provisions, among other things, prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent or calling a special meeting of stockholders, and provide that our Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws. Additionally:\n\u2022the indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) governing our 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) may prohibit us from engaging in a change of control of our company unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Convertible Notes;\n\u2022if a change of control of our company occurs, the Indenture may permit holders of the Convertible Notes to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes, and may also require us to pay a make-whole premium (in either cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash or shares of our common stock) by increasing the conversion rate for a note holder who elects to convert; and\n\u2022immediately prior to a change of control of our company, the Second Amended Credit Agreement (as defined under Note 10, \u201cDebt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K) may require us to repay all indebtedness outstanding thereunder.\nThese provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and debt instruments could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that certain of our stockholders may deem advantageous, and therefore could limit our stock price.\nFinally, our certificate of incorporation includes an election to be governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. This provision could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company by making it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to effect such a change of control without negotiation, and may apply even if some of our stockholders consider the acquisition beneficial to them. This provision could also adversely affect our stock price.\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nThe market for our common stock has experienced and may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may materially and adversely impact our\nstock price, regardless of our actual operating performance. Furthermore, volatility in our stock price could force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nSome companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary.\nOur quarterly operating results have varied in the past, and we expect that our quarterly operating results will continue to vary in future periods depending on a number of factors, some of which we have no control over, including clients\u2019 budgetary constraints and internal acceptance procedures, the sales, service and implementation cycles for our software products, potential downturns in the healthcare market and in economic conditions generally, and other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe base our expense levels in part on our expectations concerning future revenue, and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short-term. If we have lower revenue than expected, we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short-term in response. Any shortfall in revenue could materially and adversely impact our operating results. In addition, our product sales cycle for larger sales is lengthy and unpredictable, making it difficult to estimate our future bookings for any given period. If we do not achieve projected booking targets for a given period, securities analysts may change their recommendations on our stock price. For these and other reasons, we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors, and our stock price could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, and otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less indebtedness. We may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nThe Second Amended Credit Agreement and the Indenture each contain, and any future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests. Additionally, the Second Amended Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Second Amended Credit Agreement or the Indenture.\nUnder the Indenture, holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make such repurchases of the Convertible Notes. Our failure to repurchase the Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required would constitute a default under the Indenture, which may result in acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, if, upon the occurrence of a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture), holders of at least $35 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes require us to repurchase their respective Convertible Notes, this will result in a default under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, which may result in, among other things, the requirement to immediately repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under the Second Amended Credit Agreement or the Indenture, our lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit, and some or all of our outstanding indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. We may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Additionally, we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible property as collateral under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and the lenders under the Second Amended Credit Agreement could proceed against such collateral if we were unable to timely repay these amounts.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. See Note 10, \u201cDebt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was triggered as a result of the sale price of Allscripts' common stock being greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the requisite period during such quarter. As a result, holders of the Convertible Notes are entitled to convert the Convertible Notes into common stock at their option at any time during the quarter ending March 31, 2022. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our\nconversion obligations through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder applicable accounting standards, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because interest is required to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-06, \u201cDebt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity\u201d. The new standard changes the accounting for the convertible debt instruments described above. An entity may no longer be required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. This could have the impact of reducing non-cash interest expense, and thereby increasing net income. Additionally, the treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Rather, the if-converted method may be required, which would decrease our diluted weighted-average earnings per share. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022 and we expect the adoption to impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods. The new standard is discussed under Note 1, \u201cBasis of Presentation,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including those in the United States, subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the mix of our earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in tax laws affecting our products and services and the healthcare industry more generally. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other documentation by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations or that our assessments of the likelihood of an adverse outcome will be correct. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, then this could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business and reputation may be impacted by IT system failures or other disruptions.\nWe may be subject to IT systems failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to or the delivery of certain of our products or services, compromise our data or our clients\u2019 data or result in delayed or cancelled orders, as well as potentially expose us to third party claims. System failures and disruptions could also impede our transactions processing services and financial reporting.\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business disruptions have caused and could cause damage to the global economy, and thus have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other issues beyond our control. Such events could decrease our demand for our products or services or make it difficult or impossible for us to develop and deliver our products or services to our clients. A significant portion of our research and development activities, our corporate headquarters, our IT systems and certain of our other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. In the event of a business disruption in one or more of those areas, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur failure to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting could impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements.\nWe maintain internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place, such that we can provide accurate financial statements on a timely basis, is a costly and time-consuming process that requires significant management attention. Additionally, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting, or if the firm interprets the relevant rules, regulations or requirements related to the maintenance of internal control over financial reporting differently than we do, then it may issue an adverse opinion.\nAs we continue to expand our business, the challenges involved in implementing adequate internal control over financial reporting will increase. Any failure to maintain adequate controls, any inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, or any adverse opinion issued by our independent registered public accounting firm related to our internal controls over financial reporting, could increase our operating costs and materially and adversely impact our operating results. In addition, investors\u2019 perceptions that our internal controls over financial reporting are inadequate, or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, may harm our stock price and make it more difficult for us to effectively market and sell our services to clients, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. This could also subject us to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other applicable regulatory authorities, which could require the commitment of additional financial and management resources.\nWe could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges.\nWe are required under GAAP to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if indicators for potential impairment, such as a decline in our stock price, exist. Additional indicators that are considered include, but are not limited to, significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results and negative economic trends. In addition, we periodically review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates or the divestiture of a business or asset below its carrying value. We may be required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. This could materially and adversely impact on our operating results.\nThere are inherent uncertainties in management\u2019s estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge.", "PERMNO": 87078, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MDRX"}
