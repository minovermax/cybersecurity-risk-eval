{"cik": "104897", "company": "WSI INDUSTRIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-11-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\tRisk Factors.\nIn evaluating us as a company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nA large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers in a small number of highly competitive industries, and the loss of a major customer would adversely affect us. In fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, one customer in the recreational vehicle market accounted for 90%, 86% and 80% of our revenue, respectively. If there is a loss of this customer or a significant decline in sales to this customer it could have an adverse effect on our results from operations.\nThe economic conditions in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our financial results. Demand for our services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growth rates, consumer spending, oil prices, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, and the profits, capital spending, and liquidity of large OEMs that we serve. A downturn in any of the markets we serve have caused and could continue to cause our OEM customers to reduce ordering levels, resulting in reschedules, program delays or cancelled orders of our services having an adverse effect on our business and our financial results. In addition, some of our customers have their own internal machining capabilities. A downturn in one of their markets could result in them bringing machining services back in house and thus adversely affect our financial results.\nOne of our main markets is in the highly regulated energy industry. The energy industry we serve, and specifically the shale and gas fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) business, is controversial from an environmental perspective. Should environmental laws change to limit the fracking industry, it could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe operate in the highly competitive and fragmented contract machining industry. We compete against many contract machining companies. We also compete with OEM in-house operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor. The availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We also face competition from companies that are based in low cost countries. These companies may have lower cost structures and the availability of lower cost labor. To respond to competitive pressures, we may be required to reduce our prices to customers or increase discounts to customers, which would result in lower gross profit margins and decreased revenue. These factors also impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional manufacturing programs and retain our current programs.\nControlling manufacturing costs is a significant factor in operating results. The Company\u2019s ability to manage its costs on existing manufacturing programs and its ability to curtail costs and expenses on potential new manufacturing programs could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s operating results. The Company also faces increasing quality requirements from its customers that could have an impact on the costs to manufacture product.\nOperating results may vary significantly from period to period. We can experience significant fluctuations in our revenue and operating results. One of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations is the significant changes in our customer\u2019s delivery requirements. Results of operations in any period, therefore, should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Significant fluctuations in our revenue and operating results could also impact the Company\u2019s ability to comply with its debt covenants of its credit facilities.\nInternal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. We require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. However, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurances with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue in the future. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include quarterly fluctuations in our financial results, customer contract awards, and general economic and political conditions in our various markets. In addition, the stock prices of small public contract manufacturing companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nComplying with securities laws and regulations is costly for us. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, are creating particular challenges for smaller publicly-held companies like us. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting have required, and will continue to require, the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. In addition to Sarbanes-Oxley, we also have been and will continue to be required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with the SEC requirement that mandates that our quarterly and yearly filings with them be in an XBRL readable format as well as requirements related to the Conflict Minerals Reporting as required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.", "PERMNO": 81614, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "WSCI"}
