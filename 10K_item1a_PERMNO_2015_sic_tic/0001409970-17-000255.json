{"cik": "1409970", "company": "LendingClub Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. While we believe the risks and uncertainties described below include all material risks currently known by us, it is possible that these may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND REGULATION\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with issuing banks, our business will suffer.\nWe rely on issuing banks to originate all loans and to comply with various federal, state and other laws. Our primary issuing bank is WebBank, a Utah-chartered industrial bank that handles a variety of consumer and commercial financing programs. Springstone Financial, LLC (Springstone), our wholly-owned subsidiary, relies on NBT Bank and Comenity Capital Bank as issuing banks for its education and patient finance loans.\nOur agreements with WebBank are non-exclusive and do not prohibit WebBank from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. Our current agreements with WebBank have initial terms ending in January 2020, with two automatic, one-year renewal terms, subject to certain early termination provisions as set forth in the agreements. These agreements provide WebBank with a right to originate a certain percentage of the loans facilitated through our platform. WebBank currently offers loan programs through other online marketplaces and other alternative lenders. WebBank could decide that working with us is not in its interest, could make working with it cost prohibitive or could decide to enter into exclusive or more favorable relationships with our competitors. In addition, WebBank may not perform as expected under our agreements including potentially being unable to accommodate our projected growth in loan volume. We could in the future have disagreements or disputes with WebBank or other issuing banks, which could negatively impact or threaten our relationship.\nWebBank is subject to oversight by the FDIC and the State of Utah and must comply with complex rules and regulations, licensing and examination requirements, including requirements to maintain a certain amount of regulatory capital relative to its outstanding loans. We are a service provider to WebBank, and as such, we are subject to audit by WebBank in accordance with FDIC guidance related to management of third-party vendors. We are also subject to the examination and enforcement authority of the FDIC as a bank service company covered by the Bank Service Company Act. If WebBank were to suspend, limit or cease its operations or our relationship with WebBank were to otherwise terminate, we would need to implement a substantially similar arrangement with another issuing bank, obtain additional state licenses or curtail our operations. Although we currently have a non-exclusive arrangement with Cross River Bank, another issuing bank, to date Cross River Bank has not originated any loans through our platform. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements with a different issuing bank to replace our existing arrangements, we may not be able to negotiate a comparable alternative arrangement. Transitioning loan originations to a new issuing bank is untested and may result in delays in the issuance of loans or, if our platform becomes inoperable, may result in our inability to facilitate loans through our platform. If we were unable to enter in an alternative arrangement with a different issuing bank, we would need to obtain a state license in each state in which we operate to enable us to originate loans, as well as comply with other state and federal laws, which would be costly and time-consuming. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining our relationships with WebBank or other issuing banks, our ability to provide loan products could be materially impaired and our operating results would suffer.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nThe regulatory framework for our business is evolving and uncertain as federal and state governments consider new laws to regulate online marketplaces such as ours. New laws and regulations, including uncertainty as to how the actions of the CFPB or any other federal or state regulator could impact our business or that of our issuing banks.\nThe regulatory framework for online marketplaces such as ours is evolving and uncertain. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect the operation of our marketplace and the way in which we interact with borrowers and investors. For a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business, see \u201cPart II - Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Regulatory Environment.\u201d\nEvolving Regulatory Framework\nIn July 2015 the U.S. Treasury Department (Treasury Department) issued a request for information (RFI) to study the various business models and products offered by online marketplace lenders, the potential for online marketplace lending to expand access to credit to historically underserved borrowers and how the financial regulatory framework should evolve to support the safe growth of the industry. We, along with many other interested groups, submitted responses to the Treasury Department's RFI by the September 2015 deadline.\nOn May 10, 2016, the Treasury Department released a white paper on the online marketplace lending industry to continue the work initiated by the RFI. The white paper includes several recommendations to the federal government and private sector participants to encourage safe growth and access to credit. We cannot predict whether any legislation or proposed rulemaking will actually be introduced or how any legislation or rulemaking will impact our business and results of operations going forward.\nIn December 2015, the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO) sent an online survey to fourteen marketplace lenders, including us, requesting information about our business model, online platform, loan performance and investor funding process, including information regarding referral programs. In May 2016, the DBO requested additional information from us and other survey participants, including information regarding referral programs. We submitted our response to this additional information in June 2016 and continue to cooperate with the DBO's inquiry.\nIn December 2016, the Officer of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) released a whitepaper and sought public comment on whether to charter a type of special purpose national bank to facilitate the provision of core banking activities through financial technology. We, along with other interested parties, submitted responses to the OCC\u2019s proposed special purpose charter (Fintech Charter) in January 2017. We cannot predict whether or when the OCC will begin accepting applications for Fintech Charters, if we will pursue a Fintech Charter, or how this new Fintech Charter could impact our industry, business and results of operations going forward.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nThe CFPB, which commenced operations in July 2011, has broad authority over the businesses in which we engage. This includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions, such as our issuing banks, for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices\u201d through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. While we are subject to the regulatory and enforcement authority of the CFPB, as a facilitator, servicer or acquirer of consumer credit, the CFPB has recently announced that it intends to expand its supervisory authority, through the use of \u201clarger participant rules,\u201d to cover the markets for consumer installment loans and auto title loans. The CFPB is also considering whether rules to require registration of these or other non-depository lenders would facilitate supervision. The CFPB has not announced specifics regarding its proposed rulemaking and, consequently, there\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\ncontinues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB\u2019s strategies and priorities, including any final rules, will impact our businesses and results of operations going forward.\nThe announcement of our internal board review and resignation of our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has resulted in government inquiries, books and records demands and private litigation and could result in government enforcement actions and private litigation that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government investigations, and other proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as a result of our internal board review and resignation of our former CEO. Accordingly, we are and will continue to be subject to significant litigation in the near future.\nAs previously disclosed, we have received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and have been contacted by the SEC, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other governmental entities. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ, SEC, FTC and any other governmental or regulatory authorities or agencies. In the first and second quarter of 2016, several putative class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative actions were filed against the Company, including certain of its current and former directors and officers. No assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of these, or other matters. Any regulatory investigation could result in significant fines or penalties and could result in consent decrees or other regulatory directives limiting the way we do business or requiring a third-party monitor to assist in overseeing compliance. This would limit our flexibility and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in onerous or unfavorable judgments that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. In addition, responding to inquiries and lawsuits of this nature is costly and time-consuming to management, can generate negative publicity, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation. See \u201cPart II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies - Legal\u201d for additional information regarding these matters.\nNegative publicity and unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business.\nNegative publicity about our industry or our company, including the quality and reliability of our marketplace, effectiveness of the credit decisioning or scoring models used in the marketplace, the effectiveness of our collection efforts, statements regarding investment returns, changes to our marketplace, our ability to effectively manage and resolve borrower and investor complaints, privacy and security practices, use of loan proceeds by certain borrowers of ours or other companies in our industry for illegal purposes, litigation, regulatory activity and the experience of borrowers and investors with our marketplace or services, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in, and the use of, our marketplace, which could harm our business and operating results. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by our partners or partners of partners, other online credit marketplaces, outsourced service providers or other counterparties, failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of borrower and investor information and compliance failures and claims.\nWe have also received a high degree of media coverage related to the results of our review and resignation of our former CEO. Unfavorable publicity regarding these events resulted in some investors pausing their investments through the platform, resulting in a slowdown in investor demand on our platform. If this negatively publicity were to persist or recur, it could further harm our reputation, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nA decline in social and economic conditions may adversely affect our customers, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nAs a credit marketplace, we believe our customers are more highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends in the markets driven by, among other factors, general social and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. Economic factors include interest rates, unemployment levels, gasoline prices, adjustments in monthly payments, adjustable-rate mortgages and other debt payments, the rate of inflation and consumer perceptions of economic conditions. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels and changes in attitudes with respect to incurring debt and the stigma of personal bankruptcy.\nThese social and economic factors may affect the ability or willingness of borrowers to make payments on their loans. Because we make payments to investors ratably only to the extent we receive the borrower\u2019s payments on the corresponding loan, if we do not receive payments on the corresponding loan, the investor will not be entitled to any payments under the terms of the investment or whole loan purchase agreement. Accordingly, the return for the investor or whole loan purchaser would decline. Personal loans facilitated through our marketplace are not secured by any collateral, not guaranteed or insured by any third- party and not backed by any governmental authority in any way. We are therefore limited in our ability to collect on the loans if a borrower is unwilling or unable to repay.\nWe strive to establish a marketplace in which annual percentage rates are attractive to borrowers and returns, including the impact of credit losses, are attractive to investors. These external economic and social conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customers' ability or desire to participate on our marketplace as borrowers or investors thus adversely impacting the credit performance of the loans, notes and certificates, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. See \u201cPart II - Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Current Economic and Business Environment.\u201d\nIf our collection efforts on delinquent loans are ineffective or unsuccessful, the return on investment for investors in those loans would be adversely affected and investors may not find investing through our marketplace desirable.\nLoans are unsecured obligations of borrowers, and they are not secured by any collateral, not guaranteed or insured by any third party and not backed by any governmental authority in any way. We are the loan servicer for all loans supporting notes and certificates, and we are the loan servicer for most, though not all, loans sold as whole loans. Our ability to collect on the loans is dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and consequently, collections can be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, death, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. Accordingly, we and our designated third-party collection agencies may be limited in our ability to collect loans.\nIn addition, most investors must depend on Lending Club or our third-party collection agents to pursue collection on delinquent member loans. We generally use our in-house collections department as a first step when a borrower member misses a payment. Because we make payments ratably on an investor\u2019s investment (or whole loan buyer's loans) only if we receive the borrower\u2019s payments on the corresponding loan, if we cannot adequately perform collection services, the investor or whole loan buyer will not be entitled to any payments under the terms of the investment. In the event that our initial in-house attempts to contact a borrower member are unsuccessful, we generally refer the delinquent account to the outside collection agent. Further, if collection action must be taken in respect of a loan, we or the collection agency may charge a collection fee up to 35% of any amounts that are obtained (excluding litigation). These fees will correspondingly reduce the amounts of any payments received by an investor.\nSimilarly, the returns to investors may be impacted by declines in market rates for sales of charged-off loans to third party purchasers. In addition, because our servicing fees depend on the collectability of the loans, if we experience an unexpected significant increase in the number of borrowers who fail to repay their loans or an increase in the\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nprincipal amount of the loans that are not repaid, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nA relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace and may exert influence over us if we experience a slowdown in a significant amount of investment capital on our platform.\nFollowing the announcement of our board review and resignation of our former CEO, a number of investors that, in the aggregate, contributed a significant amount of funding on the platform, paused their investments in loans through the platform as they performed audit and validation tests on their portfolios, or were otherwise reluctant to invest. While many of these investors have returned, if we experience a similar slowdown of investment on our platform we may need to grant investors significant inducements to attract capital or use our own capital. In addition, because a small number of loan investors account for a large dollar amount of capital on our platform, these loan investors may exert significant influence over us, our management and operations.\nIf investors pause their investment activity again, we may need to provide further incentives, and enter into different additional incentive structures or terms to attract investor capital to the platform. These arrangements may have a number of different structures and terms, including equity or debt transactions, alternative fee arrangements or other inducements such as the use of our equity. Failure to attract investor capital on reasonable terms may result in us having to use additional capital to invest in loans or reduce origination volume. Such actions may have a material impact on our business and results of operations and may be costly or dilutive to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to enter into any of these transactions if necessary, or if we do, what the final terms will be. These actions would likely have material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition (including liquidity), results of operations and ability to sustain and grow loan volume.\nIf these inducements or investment structures are not favorable to us, or are unsuccessful in attracting sufficient investment capital to our platform, we may use a greater amount of our own capital, compared to past experience, to fulfill regulatory or contractual purchase obligations or support short-term marketplace equilibrium as new investors complete the administrative and diligence updating processes necessary to enable their investments. Separately, we may also use our capital to invest in loans associated with the testing or initial launch of alternative loan terms, programs or channels to establish a track record of performance prior to facilitating third-party investments in these loans.\nIf the loans originated through our marketplace were found to violate a state\u2019s usury laws, and/or we were found to be the true lender (as opposed to our issuing bank(s)), we may have to alter our business model and our business could be harmed.\nThe interest rates that are charged to borrowers and that form the basis of payments to investors through our marketplace are enabled by legal principles including (i) the application of federal law to enable an issuing bank that originates the loan to export the interest rates of the jurisdiction where it is located, (ii) the application of common law \u201cchoice of law\u201d principles based upon factors such as the loan document\u2019s terms and where the loan transaction is completed to provide uniform rates to borrowers, or (iii) the application of principles that allow the transferee of a loan to continue to collect interest as provided in the loan document. WebBank, the primary issuing bank of the loans originated through our marketplace, is chartered in, and operates out of, Utah, which allows parties to generally agree by contract to any interest rate. Certain states, including Utah, have no statutory interest rate limitations on personal loans, while other jurisdictions have a maximum rate. In some jurisdictions, the maximum rate is less than the current maximum rate offered by WebBank through our platform. If the laws of such jurisdictions were found to govern the loans originated through our marketplace (in conflict with the principles described above), those loans could be in violation of such laws.\nIn May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the National Bank Act and held that a nonbank assignee of a loan originated by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of federal preemption of claims of usury. The\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nSecond Circuit denied the defendant\u2019s (Midland Funding) motion to reconsider the decision and remanded the case to address choice of law matters. The Second Circuit\u2019s decision is binding on federal courts located in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont, but the decision could also be adopted by other courts. The defendant petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision and in March 2016, the Court invited the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the U.S. on the petition. The Solicitor General filed an amicus brief that stated the Second Circuit decision was incorrect, but that the case was not yet ready to be heard by the Supreme Court. In June 2016, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The Federal District Court is now hearing the case in regards to Midland\u2019s alternative claim under a choice of law analysis, and application of state law. The outcome could create potential liability under state statutes such as usury and consumer protection statutes.\nIn April 2016, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, and certain of its current and former officers and directors in federal court in New York, alleging that persons received loans, through our platform, that exceeded states' usury limits in violation of state usury and consumer protection laws, and the federal RICO statute. The Company's motion to compel arbitration on an individual basis was granted in February 2017. There can be no assurance as to the timing or outcome of these matters.\nIf a borrower were to successfully bring claims against us for state usury law violations, and the rate on that borrower\u2019s personal loan was greater than that allowed under applicable state law, we could be subject to fines and penalties, including the voiding of loans and repayment of principal and interest to borrowers and investors. We might decide to limit the maximum interest rate on certain loans originated through our marketplace, and we might decide to originate loans under state-specific licenses, where such a ruling is applicable. These actions could adversely impact our business. Further, if we were unable to partner with another issuing bank, we would have to substantially modify our business operations from the manner currently contemplated and would be required to maintain state-specific licenses and only provide a limited range of interest rates for personal loans, all of which would substantially reduce our operating efficiency and attractiveness to investors and possibly result in a decline in our operating results.\nThere has been (and may continue to be) other litigation challenging lending arrangements where a bank or other third party has made a loan and then sells and assigns it to an entity that is engaged in assisting with the origination and servicing of a loan. For example, in a lawsuit filed in December 2013, the CFPB alleged that the defendants in Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. CashCall, Inc., et al (C.D. Cal August 31, 2016) had engaged in deceptive acts and practices by servicing and collecting loans that state licensing and state usury laws had rendered partially or wholly uncollectible. The court in that case held that, to identify the true lender of a loan, the totality of the circumstances and a \u201cpredominant economic interest\u201d test should be considered. Although the decision in that case is being appealed, if a similar test were applied in a case regarding our platform, there is no assurance the court would determine that our issuing bank partners have the predominant economic interest in loans facilitated through our platform. Additional state consumer protection laws would be applicable to the loans facilitated through our marketplace if we were re-characterized as a lender, and the loans could be voidable or unenforceable. In addition, we could be subject to claims by borrowers, as well as enforcement actions by regulators.\nIf we do not compete effectively in our target markets, increase the loan originations facilitated through our marketplace, or expand our marketplace to new markets, we may not succeed in growing our business and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe consumer and small business lending market is competitive and evolving. We compete with financial products and companies that attract borrowers, investors or both. With respect to borrowers, we primarily compete with traditional financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions, credit card issuers and other consumer and specialty finance companies. With respect to investors, we primarily compete with other investment vehicles and asset classes, such as equities, bonds and short-term fixed income securities. We also compete with other online credit marketplaces. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we have, operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nTo continue to grow our business, we must continue to increase loan originations through our marketplace by attracting a large number of new borrowers who meet our platform\u2019s lending standards and new and existing investors to invest in these loans. Our ability to attract qualified borrowers and sufficient investors depends in large part on the success of our marketing efforts, particularly as we continue to grow our marketplace and introduce new loan products. If any of our marketing channels become less effective, or the cost of these channels were to significantly increase, we may not be able to attract new borrowers and investors in a cost-effective manner or convert potential borrowers and investors into active borrowers and investors in our marketplace. If there are not sufficient qualified loan requests, investors may be unable to deploy their capital in a timely or efficient manner and may seek other investment opportunities. If there are insufficient investor commitments or participation, borrowers may be unable to obtain investment capital for their loans and may stop using our marketplace for their borrowing needs, which will impact our business results.\nAlthough we have historically focused on the personal loan market, our marketplace has expanded to include small business borrowers, education and patient finance loans and auto refinance loans. We incur expenses and expend resources upfront to develop, acquire and market new loan products and platform enhancements to incorporate additional features, improve functionality or otherwise make our marketplace more desirable to borrowers and investors.\nAny new loan products and changes to our marketplace or platform could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour failure to predict market demand accurately and supply loan products that meet this demand in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\nborrowers and investors using our marketplace may not like, find useful or agree with any changes;\n\u2022\ndefects, errors or failures in our platform;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about our loan products or our marketplace or platform\u2019s performance or effectiveness;\n\u2022\ncompetition with established financial institutions;\n\u2022\ndelays in releasing new loan products or marketplace or platform enhancements; and\n\u2022\nthe introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by our competitors.\nAny failure to successfully address additional markets and loan products or develop a broader base of borrowers and investors could result in loss of market share or slower growth, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The adverse effect on our financial results may be particularly acute because of the significant development, marketing, sales and other expenses we will have incurred in connection with the new loan products or enhancements.\nCredit and other information that we receive from borrowers or third parties about a borrower may be inaccurate or may not accurately reflect the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, which may cause us to inaccurately price loans facilitated through our marketplace.\nOur ability to review and select qualified borrowers depends on obtaining borrower credit information from consumer reporting agencies, such as TransUnion, Experian or Equifax, and we assign loan grades to loan requests based on our marketplace\u2019s credit decisioning and scoring models that take into account reported credit score, other information reported by the consumer reporting agencies and the requested loan amount, in addition to a variety of other factors. A credit score or loan grade assigned to a borrower may not reflect that borrower\u2019s actual creditworthiness because the credit score may be based on outdated, incomplete or inaccurate consumer reporting data, and we do not verify the information obtained from the borrower\u2019s credit report. Additionally, there is a risk that, following the date of the credit report that we obtain and review, a borrower may have:\n\u2022\nbecome delinquent in the payment of an outstanding obligation;\n\u2022\ndefaulted on a pre-existing debt obligation;\n\u2022\ntaken on additional debt; or\n\u2022\nsustained other adverse financial events.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nIn addition, borrowers supply a variety of information that is included in the loan listings on our marketplace, and it may be inaccurate or incomplete. To verify a borrower\u2019s identity, income or employment, our verification process and teams connect to various data sources, directly or through third-party service providers, contact the human resources department of the borrower\u2019s stated employer, or request pay stubs. For example, we often do not verify a borrower\u2019s stated tenure, job title, home ownership status or intention for the use of loan proceeds.\nIf borrowers default on loans that are not priced correctly because the information provided by the borrowers or third parties is inaccurate, investors may try to rescind their affected investments in these loans or the loans may not perform as expected and our reputation may be harmed.\nIf the credit decisioning and scoring models we use contain errors, do not adequately assess risk, or are otherwise ineffective, our reputation and relationships with borrowers and investors could be harmed and our market share could decline.\nOur ability to attract borrowers and investors to, and build trust in, our marketplace is significantly dependent on our ability to effectively evaluate a borrower\u2019s credit profile and likelihood of default. To conduct this evaluation, we utilize credit decisioning and scoring models that assign each loan offered on our marketplace a grade and a corresponding interest rate. Our marketplace\u2019s credit decisioning and scoring models are based on algorithms that evaluate a number of factors, including behavioral data, transactional data and employment information, which may not effectively predict future loan losses. If we are unable to effectively segment borrowers into relative risk profiles, we may be unable to offer attractive interest rates for borrowers and risk-adjusted returns for investors. Additionally, if these models fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, we may experience higher than forecasted losses. We continually refine these algorithms based on new data and changing macro economic conditions. However, there is no guarantee that the credit decisioning and scoring models that we use have accurately assessed the creditworthiness of our borrowers, or will be effective in assessing creditworthiness in the future.\nSimilarly, if any of these credit decisioning and scoring models contain programming or other errors, are ineffective or the data provided by borrowers or third parties is incorrect or stale, our loan pricing and approval process could be negatively affected, resulting in mispriced or misclassified loans or incorrect approvals or denials of loans. While we have not incurred any material liabilities to date, if these errors were to occur in the future, investors may try to rescind their affected investments or decide not to invest in loans in the future or borrowers may seek to revise the terms of their loans or reduce the use of our marketplace for loans.\nOur ability to protect the confidential information of our borrowers and investors may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, internal employee or other insider misconduct, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers' personal data, including financial information. The highly automated nature of our marketplace may make it an attractive target and potentially vulnerable to cyber attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions. While we have taken steps to protect confidential information that we have access to, our security measures could be breached. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our marketplace could cause confidential borrower and investor information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited, our relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability.\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nare not recognized until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, hacking into the systems or facilities of us or our partners or customers, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners, customers or others into disclosing user names, passwords, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.\nFederal regulators and many federal and state regulations require notice if data security breaches involve certain personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause borrowers and investors to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation, we could lose borrowers, investors and ecosystem partners and our business and operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our insurance policies carry a self-insured retention and coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies.\nAny delay in the implementation of our technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs.\nWe believe the technology platform that powers our online marketplace enables us to deliver innovative solutions to borrowers and investors and provides a significant time and cost advantage over traditional banks that run on legacy systems. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, customer service, reputation and our ability to attract new and retain existing borrowers and investors. In addition, our future growth prospects are highly dependent on our ability to implement changes to our technology platform to support the future demands of our customers and industry. Our failure to implement changes to our technology platform and adapt to our customers\u2019 changing technological needs and requirements or to hire and retain qualified personnel and maintain our engineering and technological expertise could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAny significant disruption in service on our platform or in our computer systems, including events beyond our control, could prevent us from processing or posting payments on loans, reduce the attractiveness of our marketplace and result in a loss of borrowers or investors.\nIn the event of a platform outage and physical data loss, our ability to perform our servicing obligations, process applications or make loans available on our marketplace would be materially and adversely affected. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, customer service, reputation and our ability to attract new and retain existing borrowers and investors. Our platform systems are mirrored between two third-party owned and operated facilities. Our primary location is in Las Vegas, Nevada and is operated by Switch, Inc. Our secondary location is located in Santa Clara, California and is operated by CenturyLink. Our operations depend on both provider\u2019s ability to protect its and our systems in their facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues, environmental conditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events. If our arrangement with either provider is terminated or if there is a lapse of service or damage to their facilities, we could experience interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities.\nAny interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our error, natural disasters, terrorism, other man-made problems, or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with our borrowers and investors and our reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on the loans, damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees\u2019 attention, reduce our revenue,\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nsubject us to liability and cause borrowers and investors to abandon our marketplace, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nAspects of our platform include software covered by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, GNU General Public License and the Apache License. Open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses. Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and loan products. There can be no assurance that efforts we take to monitor the use of open source software to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our proprietary source code will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could adversely affect our business.\nAny failure to protect our own intellectual property rights could impair our brand, or subject us to claims for alleged infringement by third parties, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and other rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, underwriting and credit decisioning credit data, processes and other intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our copyright, trade secret, trademark and other rights or applications for any of the foregoing. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. From time to time, third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing on such rights. We may, however, be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. In addition, any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our loan products or operating our platform or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for borrowers and investors, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in errors or compromise our ability to protect borrower or investor data or our intellectual property. Any errors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nwhich we rely could result in harm to our reputation, loss of borrowers or investors, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. There are federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous U.S. and international jurisdictions, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. This regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or foreign laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation, discourage potential borrowers or investors from using our marketplace or result in fines or proceedings brought against us, our issuing banks or other third parties by governmental agencies, borrowers, investors or other third parties, one or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to laws, regulations and other applicable common law rules regarding privacy and privacy advocacy, industry groups or other private parties may propose new and different privacy standards. We could also be subject to liability for the inappropriate use of information made available by us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws and privacy standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws or privacy standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could result in additional cost and liability for us, damage our reputation, inhibit use of our marketplace and harm our business.\nFluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect transaction volume.\nAll personal and auto loans and nearly all small business loans facilitated through our marketplace are issued with fixed interest rates, and education and patient finance loans are issued with fixed or variable rates, depending on the type of loan. If interest rates continue to rise, investors who have already committed capital may lose the opportunity to take advantage of the higher rates, or may seek to invest capital in alternative investments. Additionally, potential borrowers could seek to defer loans as they wait for interest rates to settle, and borrowers of variable rate loans may be subject to increased interest rates. If interest rates decrease after a loan is made, borrowers through our marketplace may prepay their loans to take advantage of the lower rates. Investors through our marketplace would lose the opportunity to collect the above-market interest rate payable on the corresponding loan and may delay or reduce future loan investments. As a result, fluctuations in the interest rate environment may discourage investors and borrowers from participating in our marketplace and may reduce our loan originations, which may adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may evaluate and consider strategic transactions, combinations, acquisitions or alliances to enhance our existing business or develop new loan products and services. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business opportunity, we may not be able to successfully consummate the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain the benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nAny acquisition will involve risks commonly encountered in business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other benefits;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and resources from our normal daily operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our platform;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nregulatory risks, including remaining in good standing with existing regulatory bodies or receiving any necessary pre-closing or post-closing approvals, as well as being subject to new regulators with oversight over an acquired business;\n\u2022\nassumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired business before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, regulatory actions, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nassumption of exposure to performance of any acquired loan portfolios;\n\u2022\npotential disruptions to our ongoing businesses; and\n\u2022\nunexpected costs and unknown risks and liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nWe may not make any acquisitions, or any future acquisitions may not be successful, may not benefit our business strategy, may not generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated acquisition costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. In addition, we cannot assure you that any future acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced loan products and services or that any new or enhanced loan products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable.\nFraudulent activity associated with our marketplace could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of our loan products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase.\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with our marketplace, issuing banks, borrowers, investors and third parties handling borrower and investor information. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. Under our agreements with investors, we are obligated to repurchase loans in cases of confirmed identity theft. The level of our fraud charge-offs and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase. High profile fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.\nMisconduct and errors by our employees and third-party service providers could harm our business and reputation.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of misconduct and errors by our employees, such as the change to application dates for $3.0 million in loans as described in \u201cPart II - Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Board Review,\u201d and other third-party service providers. Our business depends on our employees and third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions, and if any of our employees or third-party service providers take,\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nconvert or misuse funds, documents or data or fail to follow protocol when interacting with borrowers and investors, we could be liable for damages, be subject to repurchase obligations and subject to regulatory actions and penalties.\nWe could also be perceived to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data, or the failure to follow protocol, and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability. Because our subsidiary, LCA, is the general partner or investment manager for a series of private funds, we could be perceived as having a conflict of interest regarding access to loans versus other platform investors. We believe that we have controls and processes in place to mitigate any potential conflicts of interest.\nAny of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to borrowers and investors, inability to attract future borrowers and investors, reputational damage, regulatory intervention and financial harm, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to attract and retain our highly skilled employees needed to support our business, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.\nWe believe our success depends on the efforts and talents of our employees, including software engineers, financial personnel and marketing professionals. Our future success depends on our continued ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled technical and financial personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, is extremely intense. We may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment.\nWe experienced a number of changes in senior management during 2016, including the resignation of our former CEO and termination of certain senior managers. Further, in June 2016 we implemented a reduction in workforce and we experienced higher than usual attrition in the months since the reduction in workforce.\nWith any change in leadership and reduction in workforce, there is a risk to retention of employees, including other members of senior management, as well as the potential for disruption to business operations, initiatives, plans and strategies. In light of the circumstances surrounding these employee actions, we offered significant additional compensation to retain certain employees. The general structure of the special retention awards provided for compensation awards to be paid or vested no later than the first half of 2017. Following the final payments on these awards, we cannot predict whether we ultimately will be able to retain these or other employees in the future, or whether we will have to incur substantial additional cost to do so.\nIn addition to attracting and retaining highly skilled employees in general, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, senior management team and other key personnel, all of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of our executive officers or members of our senior management team, and the process to replace any of them, would involve significant time and expense and distraction that may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives or impair our operations or results.\nIn addition, in light of these recent events and their potential overall effect on our business and stock price, key executive officers or senior management may opt to depart the company to pursue other opportunities, which could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives or impair our operations or results.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nOur credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a senior secured revolving credit facility of $120.0 million, which the Company may draw upon from time to time. As of December 31, 2016, we had not drawn on the credit facility. The loan agreements for our credit facility contain restrictions on our ability to, among other things, pay dividends, incur indebtedness, place liens on assets, merge or consolidate, make investments, and enter into certain affiliate transactions. In addition, we are required to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of 4.00:1.00 initially, and decreasing over the term of the credit facility to 3.00:1.00 on and after June 30, 2018.\nIn addition, any debt financing we secure in the future, in addition to or in lieu of our credit facility, could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we fail to perform under the loan agreement by, for example, failing to make timely payments or failing to comply with the required total leverage ratio, our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements, see \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - 12. Debt\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which has now been remediated. Any future failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness related to the aggregation of control deficiencies in the Company's \u201ctone at the top\u201d and manifested in three primary areas: (i) appropriate system controls, or review and oversight by other personnel, to detect and prevent sales of loans in direct contravention of a loan agreement, (ii) failure to identify related party transactions so as to ensure proper review and approval or disapproval by the Audit Committee or the board, and (iii) failure to appropriately document, authorize, communicate and monitor amendments to investor contracts.\nWhile this material weakness has been remediated, we cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material weaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nMore generally, if we are unable to meet the demands that have been placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results in future periods, or report them within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, when and as applicable, could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Under such circumstances, we may be unable to implement the necessary internal controls in a timely manner, or at all, and future material weaknesses may exist or may be discovered. If we fail to implement the necessary improvements, or if material weaknesses or other deficiencies occur, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, a decline in our stock price, suspension or delisting of our common stock from the NYSE and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Even if we are able to report our financial statements accurately and in a timely manner, any failure in our efforts to implement the improvements or disclosure of\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nmaterial weaknesses in our future filings with the SEC could cause our reputation to be harmed and our stock price to decline significantly.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. Accordingly, our quarterly results of operations, including the levels of our operating revenue and expenses, contribution margin and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Fluctuation in quarterly results may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations that could subject our business to higher tax liabilities.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. At December 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) of approximately $260.3 million and $178.0 million, respectively, to offset future taxable income. These federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2025 and 2028, respectively. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $1.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively. We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, a full valuation allowance has historically been recorded to recognize only deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. Finally, changes to the federal or state tax laws that would reduce the corporate tax rate could operate to effectively reduce or eliminate the value of any deferred tax asset. Our deferred tax assets may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and may incur net losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $234.2 million. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to be elevated for the foreseeable future as we continue to enhance our compliance systems, reestablish the growth of our business, attract borrowers, investors and partners and further enhance and develop our loan products, marketplace and platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. We may incur additional net losses in the future and may not maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe may have to constrain our business activities to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIn general, a company that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (Investment Company Act). The Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and we intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in our company being characterized as an investment company. To avoid being deemed an investment company, we may\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\ndecide not to broaden our offerings, which could require us to forego attractive opportunities. We may also apply for formal exemptive relief to provide additional clarity on our status under the Investment Company Act. We may not receive such relief on a timely basis, if at all, and such relief may require us to modify or curtail our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our registered investment advisor, LC Advisors, LLC (LCA), were found to have violated the Investment Advisers Act, our ability to raise sufficient investor commitments to meet borrower demand could be impaired.\nOur subsidiary, LCA, acts as an advisor to certain private funds and accredited investors, including those that invest in managed accounts that rely on a third-party adviser or manager to manage their investment through our marketplace. Registered investment advisers are subject to a number of regulatory and legal requirements, including fiduciary duties, conflicts of interest, advertising restrictions and custody requirements.\nAs described in \u201cPart II - Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Board Review,\u201d and previously disclosed, the board review discovered that the investment parameters of one of the funds advised by LCA, specifically with respect to the allocation of 60-month loans held by the fund, was out of tolerance. Further, we reviewed the methodologies used to determine the net asset values and monthly return figures reported for six private investment funds managed by LCA and determined that adjustments were made to the valuation of the Fund\u2019s assets that were not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These adjustments affected the direction and the specific returns reported in monthly statements sent to limited partners. We are reimbursing limited partners who, during the life of any fund, entered or exited the funds and were adversely impacted by these adjustments. As previously disclosed, these matters were included in the board review of 2016, and such matters are being reviewed by the SEC and other state and federal regulatory agencies.\nWe believe we have conducted, and we intend to continue to conduct, the business of LCA in substantial compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Investment Advisers Act) and applicable fiduciary duties. If, however, we are deemed to have breached any of our obligations under the Investment Advisers Act, the activities of LCA could be restricted, suspended or even terminated. If this were to occur, our ability to provide investors with the opportunity to invest through private funds and managed accounts could be severely curtailed, and we may not be able to sufficiently meet borrower and investor demand for loans, which could harm our business.\nWe have not reviewed our compliance with foreign laws regarding the participation of non-U.S. residents on our marketplace.\nFrom time to time, non-U.S. residents invest in loans directly through our marketplace. Through December 31, 2016, the percentage of notes purchased (based upon dollar amounts) by such persons since inception was less than 1% of all loans issued. We are not experts with respect to all applicable laws in the various foreign jurisdictions from which an investor may be located, and we cannot be sure that we are complying with applicable foreign laws. Failure to comply with such laws could result in fines and penalties payable by us, which could reduce our profitability or cause us to modify or delay planned expansions and expenditures, including investments in our growth. In addition, any such fines and penalties could create negative publicity, result in additional regulatory oversight that could limit our operations and ability to succeed, or otherwise hinder our plans to expand our business internationally.\nIf we were required to register as a broker-dealer under federal or state law, our costs could significantly increase or our operations could be impaired.\nThe securities offered to investors are offered directly by us. We do not operate as a registered broker-dealer in any jurisdiction. Although we do not believe we are obligated to do so, if a regulatory body were to find that our\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nactivities require us to register as a broker-dealer or to sell the investment securities only through a registered broker-dealer, we could be subject to fines, rescission offers or other penalties, and our compliance costs and other costs of operation could increase significantly. Further, our ability to issue and distribute the securities could be significantly impaired or curtailed.\nWe and our issuing bank partners are subject to borrower protection laws and federal and state consumer protection laws.\nWe and our issuing bank partners must comply with regulatory regimes, including those applicable to consumer credit transactions, various aspects of which are untested as applied to our marketplace. Certain state laws generally regulate interest rates and other charges and require certain disclosures. In addition, other federal and state laws may apply to the origination and servicing of loans facilitated through our marketplace. In particular, through our marketplace, we may be subject to laws, such as:\n\u2022\nstate laws and regulations that impose requirements related to loan disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, credit reporting, debt servicing and collection and unfair or deceptive business practices;\n\u2022\nthe Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, and similar state laws, which require certain disclosures to borrowers regarding the terms and conditions of their loans and credit transactions;\n\u2022\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, and Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any consumer financial product or service;\n\u2022\nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder, which prohibit creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant\u2019s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act or any applicable state law;\n\u2022\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies;\n\u2022\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar state debt collection laws, which provide guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors in connection with the collection of consumer debts;\n\u2022\nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which includes limitations on financial institutions\u2019 disclosure of nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties, in certain circumstances requires financial institutions to limit the use and further disclosure of nonpublic personal information by nonaffiliated third parties to whom they disclose such information and requires financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and nonaffiliated entities as well as to safeguard personal customer information, and other privacy laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe Bankruptcy Code, which limits the extent to which creditors may seek to enforce debts against parties who have filed for bankruptcy protection;\n\u2022\nthe Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which allows military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations so that the military member can devote his or her full attention to military duties;\n\u2022\nthe Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which provide disclosure requirements, guidelines and restrictions on the electronic transfer of funds from consumers\u2019 bank accounts;\n\u2022\nthe Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures; and\n\u2022\nthe Bank Secrecy Act, which relates to compliance with anti-money laundering, customer due diligence and record-keeping policies and procedures.\nWhile we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nIn particular, the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with FinCEN. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions. Recently several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulatory requirements applicable to our business may, among other things, limit our or a collection agency\u2019s ability to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on loans. As a result, we may not be able to collect our servicing fee with respect to the uncollected principal or interest, and investors may be discouraged from investing in loans. In addition, non-compliance could subject us to damages, revocation of required licenses, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions, rescission rights held by investors in securities offerings and civil and criminal liability, which may harm our business and our ability to maintain our marketplace and may result in borrowers rescinding their loans.\nWhere applicable, we will seek to comply with state small loan, loan broker, servicing and similar statutes. In U.S. jurisdictions with licensing or other requirements that we believe may be applicable to us, we comply with the relevant requirements through the operation of our marketplace with issuing banks or we will be seeking to obtain required licenses. Nevertheless, if we are found to not have complied with applicable laws, we could lose one or more of our licenses or authorizations or face other sanctions or penalties or be required to obtain a license in such jurisdiction, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to facilitate loans through our marketplace, perform our servicing obligations or make our marketplace available to borrowers in particular states, which may harm our business.\nInvestors in the limited partnership interests offered by LCA or certificates offered by the Trust may be deemed to have been solicited by general solicitation or general advertising, and such investors could seek to rescind their purchase.\nWe offer notes through a public offering. In addition, the Trust invests in loans through our marketplace. The Trust and LCA offer certificates and limited partnership interests, respectively, to raise capital for their investments. The offerings by the Trust and LCA are made privately with potential investors with whom they have, or have established through a review and diligence process and cooling-off period which, in our opinion, constitutes a substantive, pre-existing relationship outside of the public offering for the notes prior to an investment in the certificates or limited partnership interests and separate from the public offering of the notes. Because of the fact-specific nature of what constitutes a substantive, pre-existing relationship and the means by which it is created, as well as what types of activities might constitute a general solicitation or general advertising with regard to the private offerings of the certificates and limited partnership interests, it is possible that some of these investors could assert that they became interested in an investment in these private offerings by LCA or the Trust through a general solicitation or general advertising with regard to those offerings or the public offering of notes. If it was determined that an investor\u2019s interest in the certificates or limited partnership interests was the result of a general solicitation or general advertisement, all investors could claim that the sale of certificates or limited partnership interests violated Section 5 of the Securities Act and could seek to rescind their purchase or seek other remedies, subject to any applicable statute of limitations. We would contest vigorously any claim that a violation of the Securities Act occurred, however, litigation is inherently uncertain and can be expensive and time consuming.\nOur ability to offer our notes depends upon our compliance with requirements under federal or state securities laws.\nAll notes publicly offered through our marketplace are offered and sold pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. We also qualify as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which allows us to file automatically effective registration statements with the SEC. Under SEC rules, for certain material updates, we must file post-effective\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\namendments, which, if we do not qualify as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d do not become effective until declared effective by the SEC. We may fail to maintain our \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d status if we do not file SEC reports on a timely manner or for other reasons. In addition, if we fail to file our Annual Reports on Form 10-K or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q on a timely basis or are otherwise required to suspend use of a registration statement for the notes, we could be required to suspend offering of our notes until the deficiency is resolved. Because we offer notes on a continuous basis, securities law restrictions may also limit our ability to market or advertise to potential investors.\nWe are also currently required to register or qualify for an exemption in every state in which we offer securities. Qualification in a state can be a time-consuming process, often requiring periodic renewals. Failure to timely renew these registrations may require us to pay penalties, suspend further offerings until we regain compliance and make rescission offers in connection with previously completed investments.\nCertain states in which we offer notes also impose special suitability standards and other conditions for operation in their states, restricting the persons and conditions under which we may make offerings in these states. We do not offer our notes in all states due to the restrictions of certain states. While we believe that we may now rely on federal preemption of state registration and qualification requirements, states may interpret federal law as applied to our notes differently, possibly requiring us to continue to make filings in or limit operations in those states. Regardless of any such registration, qualification or preemption, we are subject to both state and federal antifraud rules of each state in which we operate.\nAs a result of these requirements, actual or alleged non-compliance with federal or state laws or changes in federal or state law or regulatory policy or could limit our ability to offer notes in certain states, require us to pay fines or penalties, or curtail our operations.\nRecent legislative and regulatory initiatives have imposed restrictions and requirements on financial institutions that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulations relating to financial institutions and markets, including alternative asset management funds, has resulted in increased oversight and taxation. However, the recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy.\nThere has been, and may continue to be, a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative investment funds. Such investigations may impose additional expenses on us, may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and significant legislation enacting changes that broadly affect most aspects of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, contains a risk retention requirement for all asset-backed securities, which, if applied to our business, would change our business model.\nUnder these risk retention rules, sponsors of both public and private issuances of asset-backed securities are generally (subject to certain exceptions) required to retain, in one or more prescribed forms, at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing such asset-backed securities. In some cases, this risk retention requirement may be retained by a majority-owned affiliate (as determined by GAAP) of the sponsor. These regulations generally prohibit the sponsor or its affiliate from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise selling or transferring the retained interest for a specified period of time, depending on the type of asset that is securitized. All sponsors of issuances of asset-backed securities are required to comply with such rules beginning in December 2015, with respect to asset-backed securities collateralized by residential mortgages, and December 2016 with regard to all other classes of asset-backed securities.\nThese changes could impact our access to the asset-backed securities capital markets and, to the extent we issue, or act as the sponsor for issuances of, asset-backed securities ourselves, our financing programs could be less effective\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nand we could be required to comply with these risk retention requirements. Compliance with such legislation or regulation may significantly increase our costs, limit our product offerings and operating flexibility, require significant adjustments in our internal business processes and potentially require us to maintain our regulatory capital at levels above historical practices.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nAs a result of the events surrounding the resignation of our former-CEO, our stock price has declined significantly since the end of the first quarter of 2016 and has exhibited substantial volatility. Recent developments notwithstanding, our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly operating results; changes in our financial projections provided to the public or our failure to meet those projections; changes in the credit performance on our platform; the public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; significant transactions, or new features, products or services by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; media coverage of our business and financial performance; the operating and stock price performance of, or other developments involving, other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; trends in our industry; any significant change in our management; and general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. Volatility in our stock price also impacts the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been the target of this type of litigation and may continue to be a target in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. A sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization could lead to impairment charges.\nIf we were to become subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the right of payment of investors in our notes may be senior to the right of payment of our stockholders and there may not be value recoverable by our stockholders.\nUnder the terms of the notes offered through our marketplace, we are obligated to pay principal and interest on each note on a non-recourse basis only if and to the extent that we receive principal, interest or late fee payments from the borrower on the corresponding loan, but the notes become fully recourse to us if we fail to pay such obligation, which would include being prohibited from making such payments as a result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, or if we breach a covenant under the indenture governing the notes. In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding due to a default under current or future indebtedness, an action for repurchase or rescission of securities or other event, there is uncertainty regarding whether a holder of a note has any right of payment from our assets other than the corresponding loan. It is possible that a note holder could be deemed to have a right of payment from both the corresponding loan and from some or all of our other assets, in which case the note holder would have a claim to the proceeds of our assets that is senior to any right of payment of the holders of our common stock, regardless of whether we have received any payments from the underlying borrower, making it highly unlikely that there would be any value recoverable by our stockholders.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws, contain provisions that can have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. The provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit only our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequire two-thirds vote to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d);\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which will require that all stockholder actions must be taken at a stockholder meeting;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us in certain circumstances.\nAny provision of our restated certificate of incorporation or restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15092, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "LC"}
