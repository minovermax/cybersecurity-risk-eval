These are factors that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements. We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe will need to raise substantial additional funds to advance development of our product candidates and we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient funds available in the future to develop and commercialize our current or future product candidates. Raising additional funds may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations, or require us to relinquish control over our technologies or product candidates.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional funds to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and general and administrative operations capabilities, whether internally or through other organizations. We have used substantial funds to develop our product candidates and delivery technologies and will require significant funds to conduct further research and development and preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, to seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and to manufacture and market products, if any are approved for commercial sale. As of December 31, 2019, we had $348.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity investments. Based on our current operating plan and liquidity, we believe that our available cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity investments, together with the $200.0 million upfront payment received from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together, \u201cRoche\u201d) and the $175.0 million upfront payment received from our recently announced agreement with Novo Nordisk A/S (\u201cNovo\u201d) in January 2020, will be sufficient to fund the execution of our current clinical and operating plan into 2023. However, to the extent our clinical and operating plan changes, we will need to raise substantial additional funds. Further, our future capital requirements and the period for which our existing resources are able to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect. Our monthly spending levels vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities. To execute our business plan, we will need, among other things:\n\u2022to obtain the human and financial resources necessary to develop, test, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, and market our product candidates;\n\u2022to build and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio and avoid infringing intellectual property of third parties;\n\u2022to establish and maintain successful licenses, collaborations, and alliances;\n\u2022to satisfy the requirements of clinical trial protocols, including patient enrollment;\n\u2022to establish and demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of our product candidates;\n\u2022to manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals, manufacturing scale-up, and commercialization;\n\u2022to obtain additional capital to support and expand our operations;\n\u2022to satisfy the requirements for quality and safety in developing and commercializing our products; and\n\u2022to market our products to achieve acceptance and use by the medical community.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, reduce, or terminate our research and development programs and preclinical studies or clinical trials, if any, delay or cease our efforts to build our commercial capabilities, limit strategic opportunities, or undergo reductions in our workforce or other corporate restructuring activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish development or commercialization rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue on our own. We do not expect to realize revenue from product sales or royalties in the near-term future, if at all, and milestone payments, if any, are based on third-party determinations and/or events outside our control. Our revenue sources currently are, and will remain, limited unless and until our product candidates are clinically tested, approved for commercialization, and successfully marketed. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of securities, research collaborations and license agreements, debt financings, and\ncredit and loan facilities. We will be required to seek additional funding in the future and intend to do so through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and research collaborations and license agreements. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, a number of factors, including the timing and outcomes of our clinical activities, as well as conditions in the global financial markets, may present significant challenges to accessing the capital markets at a time when we would like or require, and at an increased cost of capital. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of equity securities receive any distribution of corporate assets.\nWe have a history of operating losses; we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability, which could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history focused on the discovery and development of treatments based on the emerging therapeutic modality RNAi, a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression. Since our inception in October 2006, we have devoted our resources to the development of RNAi molecules and delivery technologies. We have had significant operating losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $525.3 million. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our net loss attributable to common stockholders was $120.5 million, $88.9 million, and $80.3 million, respectively. Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs, from general and administrative costs associated with our operations, and, prior to 2019, litigation expenses associated with the Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cAlnylam\u201d) litigation settled in April 2018. Our technologies and product candidates are in early stages of development, and we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on novel technologies.\nWe have not generated, and do not expect to generate, any revenue from product sales for the near-term future, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the cost of research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the regulatory approval process for product candidates. The amount of future losses is uncertain. Our ability to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on, among other things, us or our existing collaborators, or any future collaborators, successfully developing product candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals to market and commercialize product candidates, manufacturing any approved products on commercially reasonable terms, establishing a sales and marketing organization or suitable third-party alternatives for any approved product, and raising sufficient funds to finance business activities. If we or our existing collaborators, or any future collaborators, are unable to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or if sales revenue from any product candidate that receives approval is insufficient, we will not achieve profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022variations in the level of expense related to our product candidates or future development programs;\n\u2022delays in enrolling subjects in, initiating, conducting, or releasing results of clinical trials, or the addition or termination of clinical trials or funding support by us, our existing collaborators, or any future collaborator or licensor;\n\u2022the timing of the release of results from any clinical trials conducted by us or our collaborators or licensors;\n\u2022our execution of any collaboration, licensing, or similar arrangement, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under such existing or future arrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;\n\u2022any intellectual property infringement or misappropriation lawsuit or opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification, derivation action, or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;\n\u2022additions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022strategic decisions by us and our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, market acceptance and demand for such product candidates;\n\u2022delays in engagement of our third-party manufacturers for our product candidates or their failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements or perform in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d);\n\u2022timing of regulatory decisions and regulatory developments affecting our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments, or ongoing royalties;\n\u2022changes in general market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022changes in tax laws.\nIf our quarterly operating results fluctuate or fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could fluctuate or decline substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nOur approach to the discovery and development of innovative therapeutic treatments based on novel technologies is unproven and may not result in marketable products.\nWe plan to develop subcutaneously delivered RNAi-based pharmaceuticals using our GalXC RNAi platform for the treatment of rare diseases involving the liver and for other therapeutic areas involving the liver such as chronic liver diseases, as well as cardiometabolic diseases and viral infectious diseases. We believe that product candidates identified with our drug discovery and delivery platform may offer an improved therapeutic approach to small molecules and monoclonal antibodies, as well as several advantages over earlier generation RNAi molecules. However, the scientific research that forms the basis of our efforts to develop product candidates is relatively new. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing therapeutic treatments based on RNAi and GalXC is both preliminary and limited.\nRelatively few product candidates based on RNAi have been tested in animals or humans, and a number of clinical trials conducted by other companies using RNAi technologies have not been successful. We may discover that GalXC does not possess certain properties required for a drug to be safe and effective, such as the ability to remain stable in the human body for the period of time required for the drug to reach the target tissue or the ability to cross the cell wall and enter into cells within the target tissue for effective delivery. We currently have only limited data, and no conclusive evidence, to suggest that we can introduce these necessary drug-like properties into GalXC. We may spend substantial funds attempting to introduce these properties and may never succeed in doing so. In addition, product candidates based on GalXC may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies. Even if product candidates, such as nedosiran (formerly DCR-PHXC), RG6346 (formerly DCR-HBVS), and DCR-A1AT, have successful results in animal studies, they may not demonstrate the same chemical and pharmacological properties in humans and may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective, or harmful ways. As a result, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product, we may not become profitable, and the value of our common stock will decline.\nFurther, the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) has relatively limited experience with RNAi or GalXC-based therapeutics. We and our current collaborators, or any future collaborators, may never receive approval to market and commercialize any product candidate. Even if we or a collaborator obtain regulatory approval, the approval may be for disease indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings. We or a collaborator may be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or be subject to post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If our technologies based on GalXC prove to be ineffective, unsafe, or commercially unviable, our entire platform and pipeline would have little, if any, value, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe market may not be receptive to our product candidates based on a novel therapeutic modality, and we may not generate any future revenue from the sale or licensing of product candidates.\nEven if approval is obtained for a product candidate, we may not generate or sustain revenue from sales of the product due to numerous factors, including whether the product can be sold at a competitive price and otherwise is accepted in the market. The product candidates that we are developing are based on new technologies and therapeutic approaches. Market participants with significant influence over acceptance of new treatments, such as physicians and third-party payors, may not adopt a treatment based on GalXC technology, and we may not be able to convince the medical community and third-party payors, including health insurers, to accept and use, or to provide favorable coverage of or reimbursement for, any product candidates developed by us or our existing collaborator or any future collaborators. Market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on, among other factors:\n\u2022the timing of our receipt of any marketing and commercialization approvals and those of our competitors;\n\u2022the terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n\u2022the safety and efficacy of our product candidates;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022limitations or warnings contained in any labeling approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n\u2022the willingness of physicians and patients to accept any new methods of administration;\n\u2022the success of our physician education programs;\n\u2022the availability of adequate government and third-party payor coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022the pricing of our products, particularly as compared to alternative treatments and the recommendations of public or private pricing review agencies or organizations regarding our products;\n\u2022our ability to market and sell our products in compliance with applicable law; and\n\u2022availability of alternative effective treatments for the disease indications our product candidates are intended to treat and the relative risks, benefits, and costs of those treatments.\nWith our focus on the emerging therapeutic modality RNAi, these risks may increase to the extent the market becomes more competitive or less favorable to this approach. Additional risks apply to any disease indications we pursue which are for rare diseases. Because of the small patient population for a rare disease, if pricing is not approved or accepted in the market at an appropriate level for an approved rare disease product, such drug may not generate enough revenue to offset costs of development, manufacturing, marketing, and commercialization, despite any benefits received from our efforts to obtain orphan drug designation by regulatory agencies in major commercial markets, such as the U.S., the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), and Japan. These benefits may include market exclusivity, assistance in clinical trial design, or a reduction in user fees or tax credits related to development expense. Market size is also a variable in disease indications that are not classified as rare. Our estimates regarding potential market size for any indication may be materially different from what we discover to exist if we ever get to the point of product commercialization, which could result in significant changes in our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for that designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug for the same indication as defined by the FDA.\nEven if we, or any future collaborators, obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOn August 3, 2017, the Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (\u201cFDARA\u201d). FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA\u2019s preexisting regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The law reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nAs in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. For example, in August 2018, the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d)\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (\u201cCOMP\u201d) designated nedosiran (formerly DCR-PHXC) as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PH in the EU. In December 2019, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to DCR-A1AT for the treatment of congenital A1AT deficiency based on a positive opinion from the COMP of the EMA. Sponsors of orphan drugs in the EU can enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication. During such period, marketing authorization applications for a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d will not be accepted, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. In the EU, a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a\ncurrently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The respective orphan designation and exclusivity frameworks in the U.S. and in the EU are subject to change, and any such changes may affect our ability to obtain U.S. or EU orphan designations in the future.\nOur product candidates are in varied stages of development, including some in early stages, and may fail or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect their commercial viability.\nWe currently have no products on the market and our product candidates are in varied stages of development. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals, including ethics committee approval, to conduct clinical trials at particular sites, successfully completing our clinical trials, and successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties, such as our collaborators. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our product candidates, we or a collaborator must conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and are uncertain as to outcome. The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparative drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, and financial constraints. For instance, delays or difficulties in patient enrollment or difficulties in retaining trial participants can result in increased costs, longer development times, or termination of a clinical trial. Clinical trials of a new product candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, including patients who are suffering from the disease the product candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility criteria. Rates of patient enrollment are affected by many factors, including the size of the patient population, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the age and condition of the patients, the stage and severity of disease, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, and the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease. Thus, enrollment of sufficient patients can be challenging for rare disease drug development programs where patient populations are inherently small in size, particularly when there are competitive clinical trials.\nA product candidate can unexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical and clinical development. The historical failure rate for product candidates is high due to many factors, including scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, and changing standards of medical care. The results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase clinical trials of the product candidate. We, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, an individual Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) with respect to its institution, or an independent ethics committee may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that individuals participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects. We may not have the financial resources to continue development of, or to enter into collaborations for, a product candidate if we experience any problems or other unforeseen events that delay or prevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, product candidates, including:\n\u2022negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours, leading to a decision or requirement to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or abandon a program;\n\u2022serious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants using our products in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;\n\u2022delays in submitting INDs or comparable foreign applications or delays or failures in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators or IRBs to commence a clinical trial, or a suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;\n\u2022conditions imposed by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities, such as the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d), regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022competition for subjects in competitive clinical trials and delays in enrolling individuals in clinical trials;\n\u2022high drop-out rates of study participants;\n\u2022inadequate supply or quality of drug product or product candidate components or materials or other supplies necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022greater than anticipated clinical trial costs;\n\u2022poor effectiveness of our product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u2022unfavorable FDA or other regulatory agency inspection and review of a clinical trial site;\n\u2022failure of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including the imposition of additional regulatory oversight around clinical testing generally or with respect to our technology in particular; and\n\u2022varying interpretations of data by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies.\nBreakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nThe FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to nedosiran for the treatment of patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (\u201cPH1\u201d). A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA will work closely with us to provide guidance on subsequent development of nedosiran for treatment of PH1 to help us design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. For drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval and priority review.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe a product candidate we develop meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation may not result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if a product candidate qualifies as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification and rescind the Breakthrough Therapy Designation. If the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for nedosiran for treatment of PH1 is rescinded, submission of portions of the NDA will not be permitted under this program.\nWe are dependent on our collaboration partners for the successful development of product candidates and, therefore, are subject to the efforts of these partners and our ability to successfully collaborate with these partners.\nWe have entered into collaboration agreements with Novo Nordisk A/S (\u201cNovo\u201d), F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together, \u201cRoche\u201d), Eli Lilly and Company (\u201cLilly\u201d), Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its affiliates, \u201cAlexion\u201d), and Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (\u201cBI\u201d) (collectively, our \u201cCollaboration Partners\u201d) providing joint development of certain RNAi therapies. The success of our collaborations with our Collaboration Partners and the realization of the milestone and royalty payments under the collaboration agreements depends upon the efforts of our Collaboration Partners, any of which may not be successful in obtaining approvals for the product candidates developed under the collaboration or in marketing, or arranging for necessary supply, manufacturing, or distribution relationships for, any approved products. Our Collaboration Partners may change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced, delayed, or no additional payments to us under the collaboration agreements. Our Collaboration Partners have a variety of marketed products and product candidates under collaboration with other companies, possibly including some of our competitors, and our Collaboration Partners\u2019 own corporate objectives may not be consistent with our interests. If our Collaboration Partners fail to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or ultimately commercialize any product candidate under our collaborations, or if any of our Collaboration Partners terminates their applicable collaboration, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Each of our collaboration agreements is terminable by the applicable collaboration partner any time at will, subject to compliance with applicable notice periods. In addition, if we have a dispute or enter into litigation with any of our Collaboration Partners in the future, it could delay development programs, create uncertainty as to ownership of intellectual property rights, distract management from other business activities, and generate substantial expense.\nIf third parties on which we depend to conduct our preclinical studies, or any future clinical trials, do not perform as contractually required, fail to satisfy regulatory or legal requirements, or miss expected deadlines, our development program could be delayed with materially adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe rely on third-party clinical investigators, contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), clinical data management organizations, and consultants to design, conduct, supervise, and monitor preclinical studies of our product candidates and will do the same for any clinical trials. Because we rely on third parties and do not have the ability to conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials independently, we have less control over the timing, quality, compliance, and other aspects of preclinical studies and clinical trials than we would if we conducted them on our own. These investigators, CROs, and consultants are not our employees and we have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our programs. The\nthird parties with which we contract might not be diligent, careful, compliant, or timely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials, resulting in the preclinical studies or clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful.\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do not carry out their contractual duties, satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical studies or clinical trials, or meet expected deadlines, our clinical development programs could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected. In all events, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial as well as applicable laws and regulations. The FDA and certain foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA, require preclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with applicable good laboratory practices and clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with applicable FDA regulations and applicable good clinical practices, including requirements for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nBecause we rely on third-party manufacturing and supply partners, our supply of research and development, preclinical studies, and clinical trial materials may become limited or interrupted or may not be of satisfactory quantity or quality.\nWe rely on third-party supply and manufacturing companies and organizations to supply the materials, components, and manufacturing services for our research and development, preclinical study, and clinical trial drug supplies. We do not own or lease manufacturing facilities or supply sources for such components and materials; however, we recently entered into an initial five-year agreement with a supplier for the development, manufacture, and supply of clinical and commercial product; this agreement allows for advance preferential scheduling to the manufacturing line. Our manufacturing requirements include oligonucleotides and custom amidites which we procure on a purchase order basis. In addition, for each product candidate, we typically contract with only one manufacturer for the formulation and filling of drug product. There can be no assurance that our supply of research and development, preclinical study, and clinical trial drugs and other materials will not be limited, interrupted, restricted in certain geographic regions, or of satisfactory quality, or continue to be available at acceptable prices. In particular, any replacement of our drug substance manufacturer could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements.\nAlthough we have multiple contract manufacturers, two of our amidite manufacturers are based in China, and as a result of the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, there is an increased risk of supply interruption at those facilities. We are seeking to expand amidite production in other countries and to manufacture inventory to reduce this risk.\nIf we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our product candidates or, following regulatory approval, any products to patients, we may lose patients, physicians may elect to utilize competing therapeutics instead of our products, and our clinical trials may be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our clinical trial outcomes.\nThe manufacturing process for a product candidate is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority review. Suppliers and manufacturers must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply with regulatory standards such as cGMP. In the event that any of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to perform its obligations regarding quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may experience shortages resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints and/or stock-outs of our products, be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills or technology to another third party and a feasible alternative may not exist. These factors would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another third party manufacture our product candidates. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget.\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers if we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate. To the extent that we have existing, or enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner consistent with contractual and regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and assurance. If we are unable to obtain or maintain third-party manufacturing for product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully. Our or a third party\u2019s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022an inability to initiate or continue preclinical studies or clinical trials of product candidates under development;\n\u2022delay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for product candidates;\n\u2022lack of or loss of the cooperation of a collaborator;\n\u2022subjecting manufacturing facilities of our product candidates to additional inspections by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022requirements to cease distribution or to recall batches of our product candidates; and\n\u2022in the event of approval to market and commercialize a product candidate, an inability to meet commercial demands for our products.\nWe may not successfully engage in strategic transactions, including any additional collaborations we seek, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates, impact our cash position, increase our expense, and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as collaborations, acquisitions of companies, asset purchases, and out- or in-licensing of product candidates or technologies. In addition to our current collaborations with Novo, Roche, Lilly, Alexion, and BI, we will evaluate and, if strategically attractive, seek to enter into additional collaborations, including with major biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, or pharmaceutical companies. The competition for collaborators is intense, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Any new collaboration may be on terms that are not optimal for us, and we may be unable to maintain any existing or future collaboration if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed, sales of an approved product do not meet expectations, or the collaborator terminates the collaboration. Any such collaboration, or other strategic transaction, may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, and pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or business. These transactions entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business, and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to obtain and manage a collaboration or develop acquired products, product candidates, or technologies, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs, higher than expected collaboration, acquisition, or integration costs, write-downs of assets or impairment charges, increased amortization expenses, difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business, deterioration of relationships with key suppliers, manufacturers, or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business. Accordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Conversely, failure to enter any collaboration or other strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product candidate that reaches market.\nWe face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for our target disease indications, including companies developing novel treatments and technology platforms based on modalities and technology similar to ours. If these companies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do or their technologies, including delivery technologies, are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be adversely affected.\nThe development and commercialization of drugs is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of multinational pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, as well as technology being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors have developed, are developing, or may develop product candidates and processes competitive with our product candidates, some of which may become commercially available before any of our product candidates. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development and may become commercially available in the future for the treatment of conditions for which we may try to develop product candidates.\nCompetitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that enter the market. We are aware of many companies that are working in the field of RNAi therapeutics, including major pharmaceutical companies and a number of biopharmaceutical companies including Alnylam, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cArrowhead\u201d), and Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (\u201cArbutus\u201d).\nWe also compete with companies working to develop antisense and other RNA-based drugs including Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., Moderna, Inc., and Wave Life Sciences Ltd. Like RNAi therapeutics, antisense drugs target mRNA with the objective of suppressing the activity of specific genes. The development of antisense drugs is more advanced than that of RNAi therapeutics with several antisense therapies currently approved, and antisense technology may become the preferred technology for products that target mRNAs.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we have. Some of our competitors may be in the lead in the development of competitive products. If we successfully obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including safety and effectiveness, ease with which our products can be administered, the timing of product entry into the market, the extent to which patients and physicians accept relatively new routes of administration, timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage, and patent position of our products. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates. Competitive products that enter the market before our products could capture significant market share and create barriers to entry to our products. Competitors could also recruit our employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan.\nBeyond RNA-based platform competition, there are a number of potential competitors working to develop therapeutics in our areas of research, including Oxthera AB, Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Assembly Biosciences, Inc., AbbVie, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, and GlaxoSmithKline plc.\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management and technical personnel would impair our ability to implement our business plan.\nOur success largely depends on the continued service of key management and other specialized personnel, including: Douglas M. Fambrough, III, Ph.D., our chief executive officer; Bob D. Brown, Ph.D., our chief scientific officer; Ralf Rosskamp, M.D., our chief medical officer; James B. Weissman, our chief operating officer; and Rob Ciappenelli, our chief commercial officer. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees or advisors could delay our research and development programs and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us. We are dependent on the continued service of our technical personnel because of the highly complex nature of our product candidates and technologies and the specialized nature of the regulatory approval process. Because our management team and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued service, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our management team members or key employees. Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain other highly qualified scientific, technical, and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, manufacturing, governmental regulation, and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities, and other organizations.\nInterim and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available or as additional analyses are conducted and as the data are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim or preliminary data from our clinical studies. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse changes between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nIf our product candidates advance into clinical trials, we may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations.\nCompared to larger pharmaceutical companies, we have limited experience in drug development and with clinical trials of product candidates. As our product candidates enter and advance through preclinical studies and any clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, and manufacturing capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. In the future, we expect to have to manage additional relationships with collaborators, contract research organizations, clinical trial sites, investigators, suppliers, and other firms. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures. We may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.\nWe or our collaborative partners may conduct clinical trials for product candidates outside of the U.S., and the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials.\nWe or our collaborative partners may in the future choose to conduct one or more clinical trials outside the U.S., including in Europe. For instance, our clinical trials of nedosiran, RG6346, and DCR-A1AT each include subjects outside of the U.S. The acceptance of study data from clinical trials conducted outside of the U.S. or another jurisdiction by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions or may not be accepted at all. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the U.S., the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; and (ii) the trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to GCP regulations. Additionally, the FDA\u2019s clinical trial requirements, including sufficient size of patient populations and statistical powering, must be met. Many foreign regulatory authorities have similar approval requirements. In addition, such foreign trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance that the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the U.S. or the applicable international jurisdiction for which we plan to enroll subjects outside of the U.S. If the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our business plan, and which may result in product candidates that we may develop not receiving approval or clearance for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and commercialization and we are unable to develop sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities on our own or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on acceptable terms, we will be unable to successfully commercialize any such future products.\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing, or distribution capabilities or experience. If any of our product candidates are approved, we will need to significantly expand and implement sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities to commercialize such products, which would be expensive and time-consuming, or enter into collaborations with third parties to perform these services. If we decide to market our products directly, we will need to commit significant financial, legal, and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and supporting distribution, administration, and compliance capabilities. If we rely on third parties with such capabilities to market our approved products or decide to co-promote products with collaborators, we will need to establish and maintain marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable, compliant terms, or at all. In entering into third-party marketing or distribution arrangements, any commercial revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of the third parties and there can be no assurance that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance of any approved product. If we are not successful in commercializing any product approved in the future, either on our own or through third parties, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements, regulatory authorities could limit or withdraw any marketing or commercialization approvals we may receive and subject us to other penalties that could materially harm our business.\nThe Company, our product candidates, our suppliers, and our contract manufacturers, distributors, and contract testing laboratories are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the EU, the U.S., and other countries, with the regulations differing from country to country.\nEven if we receive marketing and commercialization approval of a product candidate, we and our third-party service providers will be subject to continuing regulatory requirements, including a broad array of regulations related to establishment registration and product listing, manufacturing processes, risk management measures, quality and pharmacovigilance systems, post-approval clinical studies, labeling, advertising and promotional activities, record keeping, distribution, adverse event reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, pricing, sales and marketing, and fraud and abuse requirements. We are required to submit safety and other post-market information and reports and are subject to continuing regulatory review, including in relation to adverse patient experiences with the product and clinical results that are reported after a product is made commercially available, both in the U.S. and any foreign jurisdiction in which we seek regulatory approval. The FDA and certain foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA, have significant post-market authority, including the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate safety risks related to the use of a product or to require withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA also has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d) plan after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug. The EMA now routinely requires risk management plans (\u201cRMPs\u201d) as part of the marketing authorization application process, and such plans must be continually modified and updated throughout the lifetime of the product as new information becomes available. In addition, for nationally authorized medicinal products, the relevant governmental authority of any EU member state can request an RMP whenever there is a concern about a risk affecting the benefit risk balance of the product. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make a future product, if any, will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, including for continued compliance with cGMP requirements. The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with our third-party manufacturers, manufacturing processes, or facilities may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer, or facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. If we rely on third-party manufacturers, we will not have control over\ncompliance with applicable rules and regulations by such manufacturers. Any product promotion and advertising will also be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. If we or our collaborators, manufacturers, or service providers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions in which we seek to market our products, we or they may be subject to, among other things, fines, warning and untitled letters, clinical holds, delay or refusal by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, suspension, refusal to renew or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls, seizures or administrative detention of products, refusal to permit the import or export of products, operating restrictions, inability to participate in government programs including Medicare and Medicaid, and total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunction, restitution, disgorgement, debarment, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.\nWe face risks arising from the results of the public referendum held in the United Kingdom and its membership in the European Union.\nWe have a subsidiary located in the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d), which we established in order to allow us to conduct clinical trials in EU member states. On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which a majority of the eligible members of the electorate voted to leave the EU. The UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU is commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, the UK ceased being a Member State of the EU on January 31, 2020. However, the terms of the withdrawal have yet to be fully negotiated. The implementation period began February 1, 2020 and will continue until December 31, 2020. During this 11-month period, the UK will continue to follow all of the EU\u2019s rules and its trading relationship will remain the same. However, regulations (including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, data protection laws, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, medicine licensing and regulations, immigration laws and employment laws), have yet to be addressed. This lack of clarity on future UK laws and regulations and their interaction with EU laws and regulations may negatively impact foreign direct investment in the UK, increase costs, depress economic activity, and restrict access to capital. The uncertainty concerning the UK\u2019s legal, political, and economic relationship with the EU after Brexit may be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border co-operation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) beyond the date of Brexit.\nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a significant adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and limit the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. In particular, it could also lead to a period of considerable uncertainty in relation to the UK financial and banking markets, as well as on the regulatory process in Europe. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates, and credit ratings may also be subject to increased market volatility.\nIf the UK and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable agreements or if other EU Member States pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the UK and other EU Member States or among the European Economic Area overall could be diminished or eliminated. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements (or lack thereof) between the UK and the EU and, in particular, any arrangements for the UK to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.\nSuch a withdrawal from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the UK\u2019s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services, and labor within the EU, or single market, and the wider commercial, legal, and regulatory environment, will impact our current and future operations (including business activities conducted by third parties and contract manufacturers on our behalf) and clinical activities in the UK. In addition to the foregoing, our UK operations support our current and future operations and clinical activities in other countries in the EU and European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), and these operations and clinical activities could be disrupted by Brexit.\nWe may also face new regulatory costs and challenges that could have an adverse effect on our operations. Depending on the terms of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, the UK could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers that could make our doing business in the EU and the EEA more difficult. Furthermore, at present, there are no indications of the effect Brexit will have on the pathway to obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates in the UK., or what, if any, role the EMA may have in the approval process. Even prior to any change to the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, the announcement of Brexit has created economic uncertainty surrounding the terms of Brexit and its consequences could adversely impact customer confidence resulting in customers reducing their spending budgets on our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, financial condition, results of operations, and could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nPrice controls imposed in foreign markets and downward pricing pressure in the U.S. may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIn some countries, particularly member states of the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs may be subject to governmental control, at national as well as at regional levels. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, in the U.S. and elsewhere, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after coverage or reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our RNAi therapeutic candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of any product candidate approved for marketing is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur business entails a significant risk of product liability and our ability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nOur business exposes us to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing, and marketing of therapeutic treatments. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of our development programs. If we succeed in marketing products, such claims could result in an investigation by certain regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used, or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, costs to defend related litigation, a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients, and a decline in our stock price. We currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of development and may need to obtain higher levels prior to marketing any of our product candidates. Any insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include, but is not limited to, intentional failures to comply with FDA or U.S. healthcare laws and regulations or applicable laws, regulations, guidance, or codes of conduct set by foreign governmental authorities or self-regulatory industry organizations, provide accurate information to any governmental authorities such as the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we may establish, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws, regulations, guidance, and codes of conduct intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws, regulations, guidance, and codes of conduct may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, business or conduct involving healthcare professionals, and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions, including debarment or disqualification of those employees from participation in FDA-regulated activities, and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and any precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, regulations, guidance, or codes of conduct. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, exclusion from government programs, or other sanctions.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of third parties with which we do business, including our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs or the theft of Company or patient confidential information.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we do business, including our CROs and other contractors and consultants, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized\naccess, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist attacks, phishing or ransomware attacks, or other similar events, could cause interruptions of our operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including, among other things, legally protected patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems and outsourced vendors. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information, including research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. Because information systems, networks, and other technologies are critical to many of our operating activities, shutdowns or service disruptions at our company or vendors that provide information systems, networks, or other services to us pose increasing risks. Such disruptions may be caused by events such as computer hacking, phishing attacks, ransomware, dissemination of computer viruses, worms, and other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our business, including loss of data and damage to equipment and data. In addition, system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, or a loss of revenues. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for any losses associated with such events. For instance, the loss of preclinical data or data from any future clinical trial involving our product candidates could result in delays in our development and regulatory filing efforts and significantly increase our costs.\nWe could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the information systems and networks of our company and our vendors, including personal information of our employees and patients, and company and vendor confidential data. In addition, outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our vendors or fraudulently induce our personnel or the personnel of our vendors to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data and/or systems. We may experience threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, phishing, and other cyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. If a material breach of our information technology systems or those of our vendors occurs, the market perception of its effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and our reputation and credibility could be damaged. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. Certain data breaches must also be reported to affected individuals and the government, and in some cases to the media, under provisions of the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), other U.S. federal and state law, and requirements of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the European Union Data Protection Directive, and financial penalties may also apply. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, internal computer systems, or those used by our CROs or other independent organizations, advisors, contractors or consultants, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information of the Company or patients, we could incur liability, reputational harm, and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nIn addition, we could be subject to regulatory actions and/or claims made by individuals and groups in private litigation involving privacy issues related to data collection and use practices and other data privacy laws and regulations, including claims for misuse or inappropriate disclosure of data, as well as unfair or deceptive practices. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls, and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. As we outsource more of our information systems to vendors, engage in more electronic transactions with payors and patients, and rely more on cloud-based information systems, the related security risks will increase and we may need to expend additional resources to protect our technology and information systems. In addition, there can be no assurance that our internal information technology systems or those of our third-party contractors, or our consultants\u2019 efforts to implement adequate security and control measures, will be sufficient to protect us against breakdowns, service disruption, data deterioration or loss in the event of a system malfunction, or prevent data from being stolen or corrupted in the event of a cyberattack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks, or insider threat attacks which could result in financial, legal, business, or reputational harm.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research, development, and manufacturing involve the use of hazardous materials and various chemicals. We maintain quantities of various flammable and toxic chemicals in our facility in Lexington, Massachusetts, that are required for our research, development, and manufacturing activities. We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these hazardous materials. We believe our procedures for storing, handling, and disposing these materials in our Lexington facility comply with the relevant guidelines of Lexington, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Although we believe that our\nsafety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by applicable regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health, and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, and the handling of animals and biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials. Additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\nOur information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\nDespite the use of off-site (cloud-based) information storage systems for certain key corporate information, our internal information technology and other infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, leased lines, and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems could cause interruptions in our collaborations and delays in our research and development work. While we qualify and seek to ensure our cloud-based information systems have appropriate cybersecurity and operations controls, we are dependent on third parties to assure their operations meet our information technology requirements.\nOur current operations are largely concentrated in one location and any events affecting this location may have material adverse consequences.\nOur current operations are carried out primarily in our facility located in Lexington, Massachusetts. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure, or other natural or manmade accidents, or incidents that prevent us from fully utilizing the facilities, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our product candidates, or interruption of our business operations. As part of our risk management policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these facilities, we cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. If our facilities are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for any other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of our research and development programs may be harmed. Any business interruption may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history, do not expect to become profitable for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be further limited. We are in the process of performing an analysis on whether we have experienced any ownership changes in the past. Our preliminary analysis indicates that we may have experienced ownership changes in November 2007, October 2010, February 2014, and March 2018. While this analysis is still preliminary, it is likely that our net operating losses are subject to such limitation. As of December 31, 2019, we had significant U.S. federal and Massachusetts net operating loss carryforwards that could be reduced or lost if we have or do experience an ownership change, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity investments is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $348.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity investments. We historically have invested substantially all of our available cash and cash equivalents in corporate bonds, commercial paper, securities issued by the U.S. government, certificates of deposit, and money market funds meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks. For example, the impact of U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults in recent years affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused\ncredit and liquidity issues. We may realize losses in the fair value of these investments or a complete loss of these investments, which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us, our interest income would suffer. The market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our compensation policies.\nAccounting methods and policies for public companies and biopharmaceutical companies, including policies governing revenue recognition, research and development and related expenses, and accounting for stock-based compensation, are subject to review, interpretation, and guidance from our auditors and relevant accounting authorities, including the SEC. Changes to accounting methods or policies, or interpretations thereof, may require us to reclassify, restate, or otherwise change or revise our consolidated financial statements, including those contained in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or product candidates, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that an issued patent will remain valid and enforceable in a court of law through the entire patent term. Should the validity of a patent be challenged, the legal process associated with defending the patent may be costly and time consuming. Issued patents can be subject to oppositions, interferences, post-grant proceedings, and other third-party challenges that can result in the revocation of the patent or limit patent claims such that patent coverage lacks sufficient breadth to protect subject matter that is commercially relevant. Competitors may be able to circumvent our patents. Development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays and it is possible that at the time of commercialization any patent covering the product will have expired or will be in force for only a short period of time thereafter.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our worldwide patent estate, not including the patents and patent applications that we have licensed from third parties, included at least 75 issued patents or allowed patent applications and over 175 pending patent applications supporting commercial development of our RNAi molecules and delivery technologies. We may not be able to apply for patents on certain aspects of our product candidates or delivery technologies in a timely fashion or at all. Our existing issued and granted patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technology or from developing competing products and technology. There is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable, or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover our product candidates or delivery technologies or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Moreover, the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our current and future proprietary technology and product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If third parties disclose or misappropriate our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely impact our position in the market.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. The standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. While we will endeavor to protect our product candidates with intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes unpredictable.\nIn addition, there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. The U.S. Supreme Court\nhas ruled on several patent cases in recent years, some of which cases either narrow the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations. The 2013 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. precludes a claim to a nucleic acid having a stated nucleotide sequence which is identical to a sequence found in nature and unmodified. We currently are not aware of an immediate impact of this decision on our patents or patent applications because we are developing nucleic acid products that are not found in nature. However, this decision has yet to be clearly interpreted by courts and by the USPTO. We cannot assure you that the interpretations of this decision or subsequent rulings will not adversely impact our patents or patent applications. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing U.S. patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period before or after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such initial grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether. Our patent risks include that:\n\u2022others may, or may be able to, make, use, or sell compounds that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n\u2022we or our licensors, collaborators, or any future collaborators may not be the first to file patent applications covering certain aspects of our inventions;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022a third party may challenge our patents, and, if challenged, a court may not hold that our patents are valid, enforceable, and infringed;\n\u2022a third party may challenge our patents in various patent offices, and, if challenged, we may be compelled to limit the scope of our allowed or granted claims or lose the allowed or granted claims altogether;\n\u2022any issued patents that we own or have licensed from others may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022the patents of others could harm our business; and\n\u2022our competitors could conduct research and development activities in countries where we will not have enforceable patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, and we might be required to litigate or obtain licenses from third parties in order to develop or market our product candidates. Such litigation could be costly and licenses may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms.\nResearch and development of RNAi-based therapeutics and other oligonucleotide-based therapeutics has resulted in many patents and patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain patent protection in the field. Our efforts are based on RNAi technology that we have licensed and that we have developed internally and own or co-own. We have chosen this approach to increase our likelihood of technical success and our freedom to operate. We have obtained grants and issuances of RNAi-based patents and have licensed other patents from third parties on exclusive and non-exclusive bases. The issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in key markets around the world that we own, co-own, or license claim many different methods, compositions, and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture, and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics. Specifically, we own, co-own, or have licensed a portfolio of patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property covering: (1) certain aspects of the structure and uses of RNAi molecules, including their manufacture and use as therapeutics, and RNAi-related mechanisms, (2) chemical modifications to RNAi molecules that improve their properties and suitability for therapeutic uses, (3) RNAi molecules directed to specific gene sequences and drug targets as treatments for particular diseases, and (4) delivery technologies, such as in the field of lipid nanoparticles and lipid nanoparticle formulation, and chemical modifications such as conjugation to targeting moieties.\nThe RNAi-related intellectual property landscape, including patent applications in prosecution where no definitive claims have yet issued, is still evolving, and it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate. Other companies are pursuing patent\napplications and possess issued patents broadly directed to RNAi compositions, methods of making and using RNAi, and to RNAi-related delivery and modification technologies. Our competitive position may suffer if patents issued to third parties cover our products, or our manufacture or uses relevant to our commercialization plans. In such cases, we may not be in a position to commercialize products unless we enter into a license agreement with the intellectual property right holder, if available, on commercially reasonable terms or successfully pursue litigation, opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification, derivation action, or cancellation proceeding to limit, nullify, or invalidate the third-party intellectual property right concerned. Even if we are successful in limiting, nullifying, or invalidating third-party intellectual property rights through such proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and could require significant time and attention of our personnel.\nWhile we believe our intellectual property allows us to pursue our current development programs, the biological process of RNAi is a natural process and cannot be patented. Several companies in the space are pursuing alternate methods to exploit this phenomenon and have built their intellectual property around these methods. For example, Alnylam controls three patent families containing both pending patent applications and issued patents (e.g., U.S. Patent Numbers 8,853,384 and 9,074,213, and European Patent EP 1 352 061 B1) that pertain to RNAi. These are referred to in their corporate literature as the \u201cTuschl family\u201d (e.g. patents and applications claiming priority to WO2002/044321, filed November 29, 2001, and their priority filings) and the \u201cKreutzer-Limmer family\u201d (e.g., patents and applications claiming priority to WO 2000/044895, filed January 29, 2000, WO 2002/055693, filed January 9, 2002, and their priority filings). Both families contain patent applications still in prosecution, with the applicants actively seeking to extend the reach of this intellectual property in ways that might strategically impact our business. Additional areas of intellectual property pursued by Alnylam and others include oligonucleotide delivery-related technologies (such as conjugation to targeting moieties) and oligonucleotides directed to specific gene targets. In addition, Silence Therapeutics owns patents directed to certain chemical modifications of RNAi molecules, including U.S. Patent Number 9,222,092, with a priority date of August 5, 2002.\nPatent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere are generally published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our product candidates or platform technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending claims in patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our product candidates, or the use of our product candidates. Third-party intellectual property right holders may also bring patent infringement claims against us. No such patent infringement actions have been brought against us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve any future infringement claims. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or continue costly, unpredictable, and time-consuming litigation, and may be prevented from or experience substantial delays in marketing our products. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our product candidates that are held to be infringing. We might also be forced to redesign product candidates so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.\nAs the field of RNAi therapeutics matures, patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents they will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation in the courts and other proceedings, such as interferences, re-examinations, oppositions, post-grant reviews, inter partes reviews, nullifications, derivation actions, or cancellation proceedings, in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the RNAi therapeutics field. In many cases, the possibility of appeal or opposition exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. The timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims or if third parties are successful in obtaining claims that cover our RNAi technology or any of our product candidates. In addition, third parties may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could require significant time and attention of our management, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to successfully compete in the field of RNAi therapeutics.\nThere are many issued and pending patents that claim aspects of oligonucleotide chemistry and modifications that we may need to apply to our therapeutic candidates. There are also many issued patents that claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for drugs we wish to develop. Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license. If those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms, we may be unable to market products or perform research and development or other activities covered by these patents.\nWe may license patent rights from third-party owners or licensees. If such owners or licensees do not properly or successfully obtain, maintain, or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, or if they retain or license to others any competing rights, our competitive position and business prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe may, in the future, rely on intellectual property rights licensed from third parties to protect our technology, including licenses that give us rights to third-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business. We also may license additional third-party intellectual property in the future. Our success may depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications licensed to us. Even if patents issue or are granted, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, such patents may have claim breadth coverage insufficient to protect our interests, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue litigation less aggressively than we would. Further, we may not obtain exclusive rights, which would allow for third parties to develop competing products. Without protection for, or exclusive right to, the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. In addition, we sublicense certain of our rights under our third-party licenses to BI and may sublicense such rights to current or future collaborators. Any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenue under our collaboration agreement with BI or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our existing or any other future collaborators.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nObtaining a valid and enforceable issued or granted patent covering our technology in the U.S. and worldwide can be extremely costly. In jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection, competitors may use our technology to develop their own products, and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where it is more difficult to enforce a patent compared to the U.S. We also may face competition in jurisdictions where we do not have issued or granted patents or where our issued or granted patent claims or other intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitor activities in these jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, make it difficult to enforce patents and such countries may not recognize other types of intellectual property protection, particularly that relating to biopharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for us to prevent the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally in certain jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nWe generally file a provisional patent application first (a priority filing) at the USPTO. A U.S. utility application and/or international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d) are usually filed within 12 months after the priority filing. Based on the PCT filing, national and regional patent applications may be filed in the EU, Japan, Australia, and Canada and, depending on the individual case, also in any or all of, inter alia, China, India, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Africa. We have so far not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. Finally, the grant proceeding of each national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might be refused in some jurisdictions, while granted by others. Depending on the country, various scopes of patent protection may be granted on the same product candidate or technology.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. These difficulties could impact the future commercialization of our hepatitis B virus infection product candidate because a substantial share of the global market is in non-Western countries. If we or our licensors encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position in the relevant jurisdiction may be impaired and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe, our licensors, or existing or future collaborators may become subject to third-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights, and we may need to resort to litigation to protect or enforce our patents or other proprietary rights, all of which could be costly, time consuming, delay, or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk.\nWe, our licensors, or existing or future collaborators may be subject to third-party claims for infringement or misappropriation of patent or other proprietary rights. We are generally obligated under our license or collaboration agreements to indemnify and hold\nharmless our licensors or collaborators for damages arising from intellectual property infringement by us. If we, our licensors, or existing or future collaborators are found to infringe a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed. In addition, we, our licensors, or existing or future collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we, our licensors, or existing or future collaborators may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. In addition, we may find it necessary to pursue claims or initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during patent prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during patent prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration, or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidates and delivery technologies, or we could lose certain rights to grant sublicenses.\nAny future licenses we enter are likely to impose various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement, and other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages, and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture, and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology, or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor\u2019s rights. In addition, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of our product candidates and delivery technologies, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how, important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe are also subject both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. to various regulatory schemes regarding requests for the information we provide to regulatory authorities, which may include, in whole or in part, trade secrets or confidential commercial information. While we are likely to be notified in advance of any disclosure of such information and would likely object to such disclosure, there can be no assurance that our challenge to the request would be successful.\nWe may be, in the future, subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 or consultants\u2019 former employers or their clients. These claims may be costly to defend and if we do not successfully do so, we may be required to pay monetary damages, may be prohibited from using some of our research and development work, and may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. From time to time, we have received correspondence from other companies alleging the improper use or disclosure, or inquiring regarding the use or disclosure, by certain of our employees who have previously been employed elsewhere in our industry, including with our competitors, of their former employer\u2019s trade secrets or other proprietary information. Responding to these allegations can be costly and disruptive to our business, even when the allegations are without merit, and can be a distraction to management.\nWe may be subject to additional claims in the future that these or other employees of the Company have, or we have, inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending current or future claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, personnel, or the ability to use some of our research and development work. A loss of intellectual property, key research personnel, or their work product could hamper our ability to commercialize, or prevent us from commercializing, our product candidates, which could severely harm our business.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic, or determined to be infringing on other marks. Any trademark litigation could be expensive. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential collaborators or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval and, as a result, may be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, record keeping, advertising, distribution, sampling, pricing, sales and marketing, safety, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of drugs. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully completed in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA as well as foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA. The time required to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate. The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when regulating us are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Any analysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in the policy of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities during the period of product development, clinical trials, and regulatory review by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign laws, regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nBecause the drugs we are developing may represent a new class of drug, the FDA and its foreign counterparts have not yet established any definitive policies, practices, or guidelines in relation to these drugs. While we believe the product candidates that we are currently developing are regulated as new drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA could decide to reclassify them, namely to regulate them or other products we may develop as biologics under the Public Health Service Act. The lack of policies, practices, or guidelines may hinder or slow review by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities of any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may respond to these submissions by defining requirements we may not have anticipated. Such responses could lead to significant delays in the clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we may seek approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we may need to demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we may market the product or the labeling or other restrictions. Regulatory authorities also may impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a REMS plan as part of an NDA or biologics license application or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug or biologic, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria, and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing, and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the U.S. and vice versa.\nIf we or current or future collaborators, manufacturers, or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions and substantial penalties, which could affect our ability to develop, market, and sell our products, and may harm our reputation.\nAlthough we do not currently have any products on the market, if our therapeutic candidates or clinical trials are covered by federal healthcare programs or other third-party payors, we will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal, state, and foreign governments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any therapeutic candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute our therapeutic candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchases, and formulary managers, among other, on the other. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the U.S. federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), which imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have \u201ccaused\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customer or promoting a product off-label. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA;\n\u2022HIPAA includes a fraud and abuse provision which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payors), or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private). Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;\n\u2022federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022the federal false statements statute which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations which require that manufacturers of drugs, biologicals, devices, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;\n\u2022federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;\n\u2022analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws potentially applicable to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u2022The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;\n\u2022the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which introduced new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements, and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information; and\n\u2022federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to state and non-U.S. equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. The approval and commercialization of any of our drug candidates outside the U.S. will also likely subject us to non-U.S. equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other non-U.S. laws.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nEnsuring that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to penalties, including civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement, or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time, and resources.\nIf we or current or future collaborators, manufacturers, or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market, and sell our products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include, among others:\n\u2022adverse regulatory inspection findings;\n\u2022warning or untitled letters;\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory product recalls or public notification or medical product safety alerts to healthcare professionals;\n\u2022restrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our products;\n\u2022restrictions on, or prohibitions against, importation or exportation of our products;\n\u2022suspension of review or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, including due to pending enforcement actions or a finding of an enforcement action;\n\u2022exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n\u2022exclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products;\n\u2022a corporate integrity agreement;\n\u2022FDA debarment of individuals at our Company;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of product approvals;\n\u2022seizure or administrative detention of products;\n\u2022injunctions; and\n\u2022civil and criminal penalties and fines.\nAny drugs we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage, and reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage, and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the\npricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor these regulations, our programs are currently in the early stages of development and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for a number of years. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country.\nIn the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Sales of products that we may identify will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. However, there may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly approved drugs. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not necessarily signify that a drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution costs. Also, interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may be insufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Thus, even if we succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, these products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any products may be insufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Because our programs are in the early stages of development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost effectiveness, or the likely level or method of reimbursement. In addition, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical, and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.\nIncreasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are seeking greater upfront discounts, additional rebates, and other concessions to reduce the prices for pharmaceutical products. If the price we are able to charge for any products we develop, our product candidates are not considered medically necessary or cost effective, or the reimbursement provided for such products is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our return on investment could be adversely affected.\nWe currently expect that certain drugs we develop may need to be administered under the supervision of a physician on an outpatient basis. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain drugs that are not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Specifically, Medicare Part B coverage may be available for eligible beneficiaries when the following, among other requirements have been satisfied:\n\u2022the product is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which the product is administered according to accepted standards of medical practice;\n\u2022the product is typically furnished incident to a physician\u2019s services;\n\u2022the indication for which the product will be used is included or approved for inclusion in certain Medicare-designated pharmaceutical compendia (when used for an off-label use); and\n\u2022the product has been approved by the FDA.\nAverage prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. Reimbursement rates under Medicare Part B would depend in part on whether the newly approved product would be eligible for a unique billing code. Self-administered, outpatient drugs are typically reimbursed under Medicare Part D, and drugs that are administered in an inpatient hospital setting are typically reimbursed under Medicare Part A under a bundled payment. It is difficult for us to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to our products in the\nfuture and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. Medicare reimbursement rates may also reflect budgetary constraints placed on the Medicare program.\nThird-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. These coverage policies and limitations may rely, in part, on compendia listings for approved therapeutics. Our inability to promptly obtain relevant compendia listings, coverage, and adequate reimbursement from both government-funded and private payors for new drugs that we develop and for which we obtain regulatory approval could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products, and our financial condition.\nWe expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs once marketing approval is obtained. One example is the establishment in 2006 of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, or ICER. ICER evaluates the clinical and economic value of prescription drugs and issues reports for payors to rely on in making decisions on patient access to new medicines.\nIn addition, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the U.S. President\u2019s administration\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2020 legislative session or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the current U.S. President\u2019s administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS\u2019s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current U.S. President\u2019s administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. While some proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current U.S. President\u2019s administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019 and would require HHS to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. The Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House of Representatives and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019. However, it is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe believe that the efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare and legislative and regulatory proposals to broaden the availability of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. A number of legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare system in the U.S. and other major healthcare markets have been proposed, and such efforts have expanded substantially in recent years. These developments could, directly or indirectly, affect our ability to sell our products, if approved, at a favorable price.\nIn 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional policy reforms. Both the U.S. Congress and the U.S. President have expressed an intention to repeal or replace the ACA, and as a result, certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or have been effectively repealed. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA and, in particular, the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn\nnegatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAmong the provisions of the ACA addressing coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products of importance to our potential therapeutic candidates are the following:\n\u2022increases to pharmaceutical manufacturer rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program due to an increase in the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and the application of Medicaid rebate liability to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans;\n\u2022creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022the expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program to require discounts for \u201ccovered outpatient drugs\u201d sold to certain children\u2019s hospitals, critical access hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, rural referral centers, and sole community hospitals;\n\u2022requirements imposed on pharmaceutical companies to offer discounts on brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the \u201cDonut Hole\u201d;\n\u2022requirements imposed on pharmaceutical companies to pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the federal government based on each company\u2019s market share of prior year total sales of branded drugs to certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense. Since we currently expect our branded pharmaceutical sales to constitute a small portion of the total federal healthcare program pharmaceutical market, we do not currently expect this annual assessment to have a material impact on our financial condition; and\n\u2022for products classified as biologics, marketing approval for a follow-on biologic product may not become effective until 12 years after the date on which the reference innovator biologic product was first licensed by the FDA, with a possible six-month extension for pediatric products. After this exclusivity ends, it may be possible for biosimilar manufacturers to enter the market, which is likely to reduce the pricing for the innovator product and could affect our profitability if our products are classified as biologics.\nDespite initiatives to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d However, as a result of tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, the individual mandate has been eliminated effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the ACA. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect the latest ruling will have on the status of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.\nIn addition, since January 2017, the U.S. President has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Further, the current U.S. President\u2019s administration has concluded that Cost-Sharing Reduction (\u201cCSR\u201d) payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until such appropriations are made. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017 and again on July 18, 2018. Furthermore, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12.0 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. On December 10, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States, which will determine whether the government must make risk corridor payments. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decisions will be released in the coming months, but we cannot predict how the U.S. Supreme Court will rule. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are complex and not fully understood.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, and, due to subsequent\nlegislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (\u201cATRA\u201d), among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Moreover, on January 22, 2018, the U.S. President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices; however, on December 20, 2019, the U.S. President signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repeals the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. Also, in 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mogiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 provided a federal framework for certain patients with life-threatening diseases to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing coverage, reimbursement, and marketing of products regulated by CMS or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, CMS coverage and reimbursement policies are often revised or interpreted in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.\nOur ability to obtain reimbursement or funding from the federal government may be impacted by possible reductions in federal spending.\nU.S. federal government agencies currently face potentially significant spending reductions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (the \u201cBCA\u201d) established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was tasked with achieving a reduction in the federal debt level of at least $1.2 trillion. That committee did not draft a proposal by the BCA\u2019s deadline. As a result, automatic cuts, referred to as sequestration, in various federal programs were scheduled to take place, beginning in January 2013, although the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 delayed the BCA\u2019s automatic cuts until March 1, 2013. While the Medicare program\u2019s eligibility and scope of benefits are generally exempt from these cuts, Medicare payments to providers and Part D health plans are not exempt. The BCA did, however, provide that the Medicare cuts to providers and Part D health plans would not exceed two percent unless additional Congressional action is taken. President Obama issued the sequestration order on March 1, 2013, and cuts went into effect on April 1, 2013. Additionally, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 extended sequestration for Medicare through fiscal year 2027.\nMore recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nThe U.S. federal deficit reached an all-time high in 2019, and efforts to bring spending under control could, among other things, lead to cuts in Medicare payments to providers, as the Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts. The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare or other programs is uncertain. In addition, we cannot predict any impact President Trump\u2019s administration and the U.S. Congress may have on the federal budget. If federal spending is reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health, to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve drug research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market, and sell any products we may develop.\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product candidate, our ability to market and derive revenue from the product candidates could be compromised.\nIn the event that any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects, adverse events, or other problems caused by one of our products, any of the following adverse events could occur, which could result in the loss of significant revenue to us and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and business:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\u2022we may need to recall the product or change the way the product is administered to patients;\n\u2022additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n\u2022we may not be able to secure or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our proprietary product candidates from government (including U.S. federal healthcare programs) and private payors;\n\u2022we may be subject to fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues, injunctions, or the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require us to implement a REMS, or to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product; we may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022the product may become less competitive; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be required to comply with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and can no longer take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements.\nBased on the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of June 30, 2019, we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d) as of the year following December 31, 2019. As a result, we may incur additional and increasing costs to comply with our reporting and other obligations that we had not historically incurred due to our status as an emerging growth company or as a smaller reporting company. These costs include (1) being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) Section 404(b) (\u201cSection 404\u201d), (2) increased disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (3) requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. These additional obligations will require us to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants, and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes, as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur stock price is volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has historically fluctuated widely and is likely to continue to be volatile. From January 30, 2014, the first day of trading of our common stock, through December 31, 2019, the closing sale price of our common stock has ranged between a high of $46.00 per share and a low of $2.45 per share. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and the following:\n\u2022the success or failure of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022delays in initiating or completing and the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors, our existing collaborators, or any future collaborators;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates;\n\u2022introductions and announcements of new products by us, our commercialization collaborators, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our or our competitors\u2019 product candidates, products, clinical studies, manufacturing processes, or sales and marketing terms;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022the success of our or our competitors\u2019 efforts to acquire or in-license additional technologies, products, or product candidates;\n\u2022developments concerning our or our competitors\u2019 products or collaborations, including but not limited to, those with sources of manufacturing supply and commercialization partners;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u2022the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies, or our industry generally;\n\u2022our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022announcement and expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022the absence of lock-up agreements with the holders of substantially all of our outstanding shares in connection with follow-on public offerings of our common stock;\n\u2022the concentrated ownership of our common stock;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022terrorist acts, acts of war, or periods of widespread civil unrest;\n\u2022natural disasters and other calamities;\n\u2022general economic, industry, and market conditions; and\n\u2022developments concerning complaints or litigation against us.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and biotechnology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nThe future issuance of equity or of debt securities that are convertible into equity will dilute our share capital.\nWe may choose to raise additional capital in the future depending on market conditions, strategic considerations, and operational requirements. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the issuance of shares or other securities convertible into shares, our stockholders will be diluted. Future issuances of our common stock or other equity securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of shares or equity securities. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of common stock or the availability of common stock for future sales will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe employment agreements with our executive officers may require us to pay severance benefits to officers who are terminated in connection with a change of control of the Company, which could harm our financial condition.\nOur executive officers are parties to employment agreements providing, in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change of control of the Company, for significant cash payments for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of up to all outstanding stock options. The accelerated vesting of options could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and reduce the market price of our common stock. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial condition. In addition, these potential severance payments may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property, or our stock performance, or if our target studies and operating results fail to meet the expectations of\nanalysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our executive officers and directors, together with holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 39.3% of our outstanding common stock, including shares subject to outstanding options and warrants that are exercisable within 60 days after such date, based on the Forms 3 and 4 and Schedules 13D and 13G filed by them with the SEC. As of December 31, 2019, our chief executive officer, Douglas M. Fambrough, III, Ph.D., beneficially owned 1,890,760, or approximately 2.6%, of our outstanding common stock including outstanding vested options; Mr. Fambrough beneficially owned 2,401,700 shares or approximately 3.4% of our outstanding common stock including outstanding vested and unvested options. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will continue to have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as, or may even conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders. For example, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our Company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our Company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022a prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022a requirement that special meetings of stockholders, which the Company is not obligated to call more than once per calendar year, be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, or, subject to certain conditions, by our secretary at the request of the stockholders holding of record, in the aggregate, shares entitled to cast not less than ten percent of the votes at a meeting of the stockholders (assuming all shares entitled to vote at such meeting were present and voted);\n\u2022advance notice requirements for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock, such as the Redeemable Convertible Preferred, with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15 percent of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15 percent of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. These provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur, and we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules\nand regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we are no longer an emerging growth company and will be required to comply with the rules of the SEC that implement Section 404(b). To achieve compliance with Section 404(b) within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we are dedicating internal resources, engaging outside consultants, and have adopted a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal controls over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 in one or more future periods. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, if we are not able to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain of our common stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nWe may incur significant costs from class action litigation due to our historical or expected stock volatility.\nOur stock price has fluctuated and may fluctuate for many reasons, including as a result of public announcements regarding the progress of our development efforts or the development efforts of our collaborators or competitors, the addition or departure of our key personnel, variations in our quarterly operating results, and changes in market valuations of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. This risk is especially relevant to us because pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. When the market price of a stock has been volatile as our stock price has been and may be, holders of that stock have occasionally brought securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit of this type against us, even if the lawsuit is without merit, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. The lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings and exercise of outstanding options.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, as we did with the Redeemable Convertible Preferred, which was converted into common stock in December 2017 and with the follow-on offerings of our common stock in December 2017 and September 2018. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price paid by our existing shareholders, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by our existing stockholders.\nIn addition, we have a significant number of securities allowing for the purchase of our common stock. As of February 24, 2020, we also had 7,781,915 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans. As of that date, there were also stock options and awards to purchase 15,045,098 shares of our common stock outstanding and warrants to purchase 2,198 shares of our common stock outstanding. The exercise of outstanding options and warrants having an exercise price per share that is less than the offering price per share paid by our existing stockholders will increase dilution to such stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of February 24, 2020, we had 73,750,617 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which, other than shares held by our directors and certain officers, were eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144, including the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements. In addition, shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and shares reserved for future issuances under our stock incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by applicable vesting requirements and subject in some cases to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144.\nSales of shares issued in private placements may cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nIn April 2017, we issued 700,000 shares of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred in a private placement, which were convertible into shares of our common stock at an agreed conversion rate. In December 2017, all shares of Redeemable Convertible Preferred were converted into shares of our common stock. We granted the holders of Redeemable Convertible Preferred certain demand, shelf, and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred. Such registration rights continue subsequent to the conversion and repurchase of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred with respect to the shares of common stock issued in such conversion. In accordance with such registration rights, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of 24,491,663 shares of our common stock by the former holders of Redeemable Convertible Preferred. The registration statement was declared effective on May 9, 2018, and all shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred may now be freely sold in the open market. Additionally, we issued 983,208 shares of our common stock to Alnylam in April 2018, 835,834 shares of our common stock to Alexion in October 2018, 5,414,185 shares of our common stock to Lilly in December 2018, and 2,279,982 shares of our common stock to Novo in December 2019. The shares issued to Alnylam are freely tradeable in the open market, subject to certain volume limitations and compliance with applicable securities laws. The shares issued to Alexion may be freely sold in the open market subject to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. The shares issued to Novo are subject to a lock-up period but, following the expiration of such lock-up periods, such shares of our common stock may be freely sold in the open market subject to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. The sale of a significant amount of these shares in the open market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or become highly volatile.", "PERMNO": 14426, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "DRNA"}
