{"cik": "1340476", "company": "DIRTT ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS LTD", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Part II, Item 7. entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and in any documents incorporated in this Annual Report by reference, before deciding whether to invest in our common shares. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Although we have discussed all known material risks, the risks described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See also \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to continue to persuade clients to utilize our innovative and unique approach to interior construction rather than traditional interior construction methods. Our failure to compete effectively by not offering compelling products and services or by not pricing our solutions competitively could materially and adversely affect our market share, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that is constantly developing and changing. We compete on the basis of, among other things, price, predictability of timing and cost, speed, quality, customization, and product design. Our main competitors primarily consist of conventional construction firms, individual tradespeople (including framers, drywall installers, and interior product designers) and modular systems manufacturers. In addition, new market entrants and conventional construction firms are beginning to develop customizable wall paneling and other modular interior construction solutions. We also compete with commercial furniture manufacturers, such as Teknion Corporation, Haworth Inc. and Allsteel Inc., who offer a variety of prefabricated interior wall solutions. Our competitors may have greater financial, technical, sales, production and marketing resources, and they may develop products that achieve greater market acceptance, hire key personnel, or introduce competing or disruptive technology, all of which may reduce demand for DIRTT Solutions. In addition, we face pricing pressure on large construction projects from our competitors who take on projects at reduced prices or at a loss to ensure continuity of work. If we are unable to provide competitive pricing terms for DIRTT Solutions, our sales may be reduced. If we reduce our pricing to compete in these situations, our revenues and operating margins may decrease.\nOur products are unique and offer an alternative to traditional construction techniques. Market acceptance of offsite construction methods is growing, but this still represents only a fraction of all construction methods and the overall construction market. Our ability to grow and increase market share depends, in part, on our success in continuing to increase demand for modular construction methods and products as an alternative to more traditional construction methods. While we intend to follow a strategy of continuing product development to enhance our position to the extent practicable, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position in the industry or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition. There is no guarantee that we, together with our Distribution Partners, can increase our client base or that our solutions will attain a degree of market acceptance sufficient for sustained profitable operations. Failure to compete effectively by, among other things, meeting consumer preferences, developing and marketing innovative solutions, maintaining strong client service and distribution relationships, growing market share, and expanding our solutions capabilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the competition for highly skilled technical, research and development, management, sales and other employees is high in our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract qualified personnel or retain our current personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain appropriate executives and employees, our business, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGlobal economic, political and social conditions and financial markets may impact our ability to do business and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is cyclical and highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. We are subject to global economic, political and social conditions that may cause an overall decline or reduction in construction and renovation due to economic downturns, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, geopolitical uncertainties, tariffs and other macroeconomic factors. We face risks that may arise from financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, Distribution Partners or clients. For example, our Distribution Partners and their clients may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could result in the delay or cancellation of their plans to purchase DIRTT Solutions or lead to our inability to obtain payment of accounts receivable that they may owe. Such clients or potential clients may also be unable to obtain financing for their construction projects, including purchases of DIRTT Solutions. Our suppliers of raw materials, finished products or components may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could lead to disruption in our manufacturing processes. Additionally, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, particularly in regions where we have key suppliers. For example, we rely on suppliers in China for certain of our raw materials and consequences of the coronavirus could include quarantines, labor shortages, and reduced output of these suppliers. Any general economic, political or social conditions that may contribute to financial difficulties experienced by us, our suppliers, Distribution Partners or clients may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend heavily on our network of Distribution Partners for distribution and sales, and the loss or inattention of our Distribution Partners could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently do not engage in many direct sales projects and rely almost exclusively on our network of Distribution Partners to promote brand awareness, sell and market DIRTT Solutions, and provide design, installation, distribution and other services to clients on each project. While we are not dependent on any single Distribution Partner, sales generated by approximately 10% of our Distribution Partners comprised approximately 32.6% of our total revenues for 2019. The loss of any top performing Distribution Partners, or their failure to adequately penetrate local markets, may negatively affect our sales, financial condition or results of operations. The loss of a Distribution Partner could also impair our ability to maintain a presence in a particular geographic region while we establish another Distribution Partner relationship in that region, which would require significant time and resources.\nOur arrangements with our Distribution Partners are generally not exclusive, meaning that our Distribution Partners may market and sell both DIRTT Solutions and the products of our competitors. We may have multiple Distribution Partners in a geographic region depending on the size of the region. We offer our DIRTT Solutions at the same prices to our Distribution Partners, and, while we make recommendations on pricing terms to clients, our Distribution Partners may implement different pricing models that may be in excess of what clients in their territory would be willing to pay for DIRTT Solutions or that may be detrimental to other Distribution Partners who may offer different pricing terms.\nWe provide training and education to our Distribution Partners covering DIRTT Solutions and installation, sales, client service and experience, and maintenance of client relationships. However, our Distribution Partners may not be able to successfully sell our DIRTT Solutions or manage client experiences and relationships. Additionally, Distribution Partners may not successfully transport, deliver or install DIRTT Solutions, which could damage their relationships with clients and harm our reputation. Our ability to generate revenue in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining effective working relationships with our Distribution Partners, choosing quality Distribution Partners, assisting our Distribution Partners to independently sell and to correctly install our DIRTT Solutions, and training our Distribution Partners to develop and maintain successful client relationships. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our Distribution Partners, or if our Distribution Partners are unable to maintain successful relationships with clients, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to maintain and manage growth effectively. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and operational and financial resources. Additionally, we expect to scale our business for sustainable, profitable growth as part of our overall business strategy. Managing growth of our operations and personnel requires continuous improvement of our internal controls and reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty in providing current DIRTT Solutions and introducing future solutions, difficulty in securing clients and Distribution Partners, declines in quality or client satisfaction, increases in costs or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could lead to loss of investor confidence and adversely affect our business performance, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our strategic plan.\nIn November 2019, we unveiled a four-year strategic plan for the Company, based on three key pillars of commercial execution, manufacturing excellence and innovation, to scale our business. We began implementing the strategic plan in the fourth quarter of 2019, including through hiring for key positions and the expansion of our Distribution Partner network. Failure to implement our strategic plan could materially and adversely affect our near term sales, commercial activities, and ability to develop and sustain profitable growth. Additionally, while we believe that the strategic plan will result in increased revenue and profitability, there is no guarantee that the strategic plan, even if successfully implemented, will lead to sustainable, profitable growth. Implementing the strategic plan may itself be disruptive to the Company. Any of these difficulties could materially and adversely affect our business performance, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in designing, introducing or selling new, innovative solutions, solution features or software.\nOur future success depends in part on our continuing ability to promote and demonstrate the value proposition of DIRTT Solutions, as well as our ability to develop new, innovative solutions or solution features that differentiate our solutions and achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. We incur significant costs associated with the investment in our research and development in furtherance of our strategy that may not result in increased revenue or demand for DIRTT Solutions and that could negatively affect our results of operations. Rapidly changing technology, evolving regulatory and industry standards, and changing consumer trends, demands and requirements require us to continuously innovate and develop new, high-quality, solutions, solutions features and software. Additionally, such rapid technological changes, standards and preferences could render the complex and proprietary technology of our software and solutions obsolete. We may also be unable to successfully address these developments on a timely basis, or at all. New solutions, solution features or software may also be less successful than we anticipated, and such offerings may fail to achieve market acceptance. If we fail to respond quickly and cost-effectively to a changing market and changing consumer preferences, our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, quarterly and yearly fluctuations in results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may continue to fluctuate from one quarter or year to another due to a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Furthermore, our actual or projected results of operations may fail to match our past performance. These events could in turn cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate. In particular, if our results of operations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical results of operations, the market price of our common shares will likely decline. Due to our high fixed manufacturing costs and operating expenses, quarterly volatility in sales volumes could result in periods of low operating cash flow and negatively affect our liquidity.\nThe construction industry has also historically experienced seasonal slowdowns related to winter weather conditions and holiday schedules in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. Our business has generally followed this trend with a slight time lag, leading to stronger sales in the second half of the year versus the first half. Weather conditions, such as unseasonably warm, cold or wet weather, which affect, and sometimes delay or accelerate, delivery and installation of some of our products, may significantly affect our results of operations. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the extreme weather conditions experienced in the United States negatively affected the delivery of projects and our financial condition. Sales that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter, affecting both quarters\u2019 results and potentially the trading price of our common shares. In addition, we typically ship orders within two weeks of when we receive them and maintain inventory levels to allow us to operate with little backlog. The efficiency of our inventory system, and our ability to avoid backlogs and potential loss of clients, is closely tied to our ability to accurately predict seasonal and quarterly variances. Our planned expenditures are also based primarily on sales forecasts. Our sales cycle is generally long, making our sales forecasts more uncertain than in businesses with short sales cycles. When sales do not meet our expectations, our results of operations will be reduced for the relevant quarters, as we will have already incurred expenses based on those expectations. Additionally, while we can adjust our direct labor headcount by virtue of more or fewer shifts, our ability to quickly react to significant swings in revenue may be limited by how quickly we can adjust our headcount. Due to these risk factors, quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year comparisons of our results of operations may not be an indicator of future performance.\nTurnover of our key executives, and difficulty of recruiting and retaining key employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe performance of key personnel is essential to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified key personnel as needed. We have experienced executive-level changes since 2017, which could negatively affect our ability to retain other key executives and employees. Between September 2018 and January 2019, two of our three co-founders left the Company, and commenced a competing business. Our third co-founder retired in November 2019. Our business has a long sales cycle, and we believe the distraction from significant management changes since 2017 has adversely affected our sales efforts during 2018, and therefore our 2019 revenues, to a greater extent than we anticipated. While we believe that these management changes will ultimately position the Company for growth, we cannot provide any assurance that we will effectively manage these or any other management transitions. Failure to effectively manage these transitions may affect our ability to retain our new or remaining key executives and employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLabor shortages and disruptions in our manufacturing facilities may delay or impede production and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes and technology development largely depend on human labor, although certain parts are automated or integrated with technology. Our distributed manufacturing approach allows us to shift production among our manufacturing facilities, although not all production can be moved. As a custom manufacturer, we do not carry finished goods inventory that can withstand a labor shortage or disruption for an extended period of time. We may therefore be affected by labor shortages or disruptions, particularly in the United States. Both our profitability and our ability to scale could be adversely affected if we encounter difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience any labor shortages or disruptions, we could incur higher recruiting expenses or a loss of manufacturing capabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims on DIRTT Solutions, which if successfully asserted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur DIRTT Solutions are generally backed by warranties, some of which are up to 10 years. We may, from time to time, be involved in product liability and product warranty claims relating to DIRTT Solutions that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2019, we incurred costs in the amount of $2.6 million in connection with remediating deficiencies in our solutions, including in costs related to tile warping, and we provided an incremental $2.5 million to our liability related to potential costs to remediate DIRTT Timber installed on projects between 2016 and 2019 that may not have met fire retardant standards under which they were sold. We are in discussions with our insurance carrier to determine how much, if any, of this liability is covered by insurance. Although we maintain warranty and other reserves in an amount based primarily on production, historical and anticipated warranty claims, future warranty claims may exceed this amount resulting in a need to increase the reserve. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could also result in clients rejecting our products and damage to our reputation, all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe have also on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in the design, manufacturing, assembling, labeling, product formulations or testing of DIRTT Solutions. DIRTT Timber is occasionally integrated as structural components in projects; therefore, any future flaws and deficiencies in certain DIRTT Timber projects may compromise the structure of the project. Some flaws and deficiencies have not been apparent until after the solutions were installed. If any flaws or deficiencies exist in our products and if such flaws or deficiencies are not discovered and corrected before DIRTT Solutions are installed or otherwise incorporated into the structures, damages could result, including collapse, fire, personal injury or death. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend, could divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome, and could result in negative publicity. Increased costs to address product warranty claims or to defend against product liability claims may result in increased expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of general contractors and their sub-contractors, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nErrors in the installation of DIRTT Solutions, even if the products are free of flaws and deficiencies, could also cause personal injury or death. To the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by our product liability insurance and we are held to be liable, we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury or death, and our reputation, business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, we may incur additional costs to refund clients or repair or recall DIRTT Solutions, including costs to remedy the affected structures. We also may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms that provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Any such claims, if asserted, could require us to expend material time and efforts defending or resolving the claim and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur software and products may have design defects, deficiencies, or risks, and we may incur additional costs to fix any defects, deficiencies or risks.\nOur software and solutions are complex and must meet the technical requirements of our clients and applicable building codes and regulations. Our solutions may contain undetected errors or design and manufacturing defects, and our software may experience quality or reliability problems, or contain bugs or other defects. Software defects may also cause errors in our manufacturing or miscalculations in ordering pricing and could lead us to incur losses and lose market share to competitors. Product or software defects could cause us to incur warranty costs, product liability costs, and repair and remediation costs. Although we maintain commercial general liability and errors and omissions liability insurance, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect us against substantial claims.\nOur former co-founders\u2019 competitive behavior against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn September 10, 2018, our co-founder and former Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mogens Smed, left the Company. In connection with his departure, Mr. Smed entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with the Company that provided, among other things, for the continued adherence to the non-compete and non-solicit obligations of his employment agreement. Mr. Smed, along with another former founder, Barrie Loberg, who was our former Vice President of Software Development, have started an interior construction and manufacturing company that we believe competes with us. Since January 2019, a number of our employees have departed to join this new company. Mr. Smed, Mr. Loberg and a number of our former employees who have joined their company have in-depth knowledge about our business, such as our customers, employees, Distribution Partners, consultants, products, policies, practices and prospects, and we may be adversely affected by increased competition arising out of this competing business venture. We believe that Messrs. Smed and Loberg are not permitted to solicit our current and former employees, Distribution Partners and customers or otherwise engage in competitive behavior. On May 9, 2019, we filed a lawsuit in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta against Messrs. Smed and Loberg to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement and their respective obligations, including non-compete and non-solicit provisions, and they have denied liability and counterclaimed asserting rights to further compensation and damages for defamation. We are engaged in other litigation with Messrs. Smed and Loberg, or entities with which they are involved, relating to similar claims and disputes over alleged misappropriation of proprietary information by them or by us. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d If Messrs. Smed and Loberg further engage in a competitive business against us or if we are not successful in enforcing the Settlement Agreement, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately from infringement by third parties, and we may also be subject to claims that we infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\nWe expend considerable efforts to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of contract, copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and other measures to protect our proprietary information. There can be no assurance that our various patents, copyrights or trademarks will offer sufficient protection and prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Additionally, our software copyright and other protections might not be adequate to protect our software and application code. We also may not be granted patents, copyrights or trademarks on our pending or proposed applications, and granted applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future.\nWe will not be able to protect our intellectual property, trade secrets, or other proprietary information if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Additionally, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours. We enforce our intellectual property rights where appropriate, but the cost of doing so may be substantial and could outweigh the potential benefits, and we may be unsuccessful in our enforcement efforts. Failure to protect or maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property could adversely affect our ability to sell original products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our technology, including ICE Software, manufacturing processes, and DIRTT Solutions. Although we do not believe that our software or DIRTT Solutions infringe on the proprietary rights of any third parties, claims may arise regarding infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims). Such assertions or prosecutions, regardless of their merit, may subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from assembling or licensing certain of our products, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the marketplaces in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our clients, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements. A damages award against us could include an award of royalties or lost profits and, if the court finds willful infringement, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. This may cause us to expend significant costs and resources, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our reputation and profitability could be negatively affected.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we generate, collect and store confidential and proprietary information, including intellectual property and business information. While we do not generally collect information from clients and Distribution Partners, we may obtain certain of their information from time to time during the ordinary course of business. The secure storage, maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is important to our operations and reputation. Various third parties, including computer hackers, who are continually becoming more aggressive and sophisticated, may attempt to penetrate our network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential client, Distribution Partner, employee or supplier information. In addition, one of our Distribution Partners, employees, or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. There is no guarantee that our security systems, processes or procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, misuse of data, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of a client, Distribution Partner, employee, supplier or Company information could result in financial losses, exposure to litigation risks and liability (including regulatory liability), damages to our reputation, and disruptions in our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and frequently changing requirements, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. These costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security breaches, could be substantial and adversely affect our business. A significant compromise of sensitive employee, Distribution Partner, client or supplier data in our possession could result in legal damages and regulatory penalties. In addition, the costs of defending such actions or remediating breaches could be material.\nDamage to our information technology and software systems could impair our ability to effectively provide DIRTT Solutions, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nOur information technology and software networks and systems, which include the processing, transmission and storage of information, are integrated with our manufacturing processes and essential to our business operations. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from power outages, network failures or natural disasters, loss or corruption of data, human error, employee misconduct and difficulties associated with upgrades, installations of major software or hardware, and integration with new systems. While we maintain retention backups to geo-diverse digital and physical locations and have a recovery data center, the data center and other protective measures we take could prove to be inadequate. Any disruption in our systems or unauthorized disclosure of information could result in delayed manufacturing and delivery of our DIRTT Solutions, legal claims, a loss of intellectual property and a disruption in operations, all of which could adversely affect our reputation, relationships with clients, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the prices of our commodities, including raw materials, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe experience fluctuations in the cost of our raw materials, including aluminum, glass and wood. A variety of factors over which we have no control, such as global demand for aluminum, fluctuations in transportation costs, speculation in commodities futures, changes in laws or regulations, and the creation of new materials or products based on new technologies may affect the purchase and transportation costs and availability of raw materials that we use to manufacture DIRTT Solutions. These factors may also magnify the effect of economic cycles on our business. In addition, we have not historically entered into long-term agreements with vendors and, if we continue to do so, we may be exposed to short-term and long-term price fluctuations as a result.\nAluminum represents the largest component of our raw materials consumption. Substantial, prolonged upward trends in aluminum prices could significantly increase the cost of our aluminum needs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have experienced fluctuations in the price of aluminum and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue in the future. In 2018, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and limited the amounts of steel and aluminum coming into the United States based on the countries of origin of those imports. In 2018 and 2019, we sourced the majority of our aluminum from North America and sourced under 10% of our raw materials from outside North America. Nonetheless, tariffs and import limitations may increase the prices we pay for aluminum. Increases in the price that we pay for our commodities, including raw materials, could adversely affect our liquidity, operating margins, and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of outside suppliers for certain key components and materials, and failure or delay in obtaining the necessary components or materials could delay or prevent the manufacturing or distribution of our DIRTT Solutions.\nWe rely on certain key suppliers for raw materials and components, including aluminum, glass and wood. We maintain multiple suppliers for key materials, although two suppliers accounted for approximately 32% and 21% of our aluminum supply for the year ended December 31, 2019. While we believe there are other vendors for most of our key requirements, certain materials meeting our quality standards are available only through a limited number of vendors. If we are required to obtain another source for these materials or components, we may not be able to obtain pricing on as favorable terms or on terms comparable to our competitors. Any failure or delay in obtaining the necessary raw materials in the quantities and quality required may result in increased costs and delays in manufacturing or distributing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. A vendor may also choose, subject to existing contracts, to modify its relationship with us due to general economic concerns or specific concerns relating to that vendor or us, at any time. These modifications might include additional requirements from our suppliers that we provide them additional security in the form of prepayments or with letters of credit. Any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur current manufacturing facilities may reach capacity, and we may have difficulty procuring adequate manufacturing space to meet our needs.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in Calgary, Alberta; Phoenix, Arizona; and Savannah, Georgia. Our wall tiles, millwork and timber solutions are manufactured in Calgary, while aluminum, glass and power components are manufactured in all three locations. We may be constrained by physical capacity in our facilities. While we may address increased short-term demands through the addition of production shifts in our manufacturing facilities, we may need to expand our current manufacturing capabilities and add or expand facilities within the next two to three years. For example, we are in the process of constructing a build-to-suit combined tile and millwork factory in Rock Hill, South Carolina. If we are unable to timely meet increased demands, we could experience delays in production and shipments of product due to both the loss of inventory and materials storage and production capacity, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental, health and safety laws and related claims, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other requirements with respect to workers\u2019 health and safety and environmental matters in the United States, Canada and other countries in which we operate. The costs of compliance with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. Environmental laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the production, processing, preparation, handling, storage, transportation, disposal and management of wastes and other substances, and the prevention and remediation of environmental effects. More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and emission of greenhouse gases may be adopted in the future and could impact our facilities, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our solutions, and our clients, which could reduce demand for our solutions or cause us to incur additional operating costs. Health and safety laws and regulations impose, among other things, requirements designed to ensure the protection of workers. In addition, we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits in order to operate our facilities and in connection with the design, development, manufacture and transport of our products and the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, including environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits governing air emissions. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, damages and fines, and our operations could be curtailed, suspended or shutdown and our reputation, ability to attract employees, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, certain foreign laws and regulations may affect our ability to export products outside of or import into the United States or Canada. Although we handle minimal quantities of hazardous substances, existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations apply to our operations, new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our products, and future changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could occur. These factors may materially increase the amount we must invest to bring our processes into compliance with legal requirements and impose additional expenses on our operations.\nPrivate lawsuits, including claims for remediation of contamination, personal injury or property damage, or actions by regional, national, state and local regulatory agencies, including enforcement or cost-recovery actions, may materially increase our costs. Certain environmental laws make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for the remediation of contamination at or emanating from properties or facilities that we currently or formerly owned or operated or properties to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Such liability may require us to pay more than our proportionate share based on our contribution to the amount or type of waste we dispose and could require us to address contamination caused by others. Any changes in these laws or regulations or changes in our manufacturing processes may require us to request changes to our existing permits or obtain new permits. Any requests to change our existing permits or obtain new permits may be delayed or denied and may require us to modify our manufacturing processes, which could be costly and time consuming and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain, from time to time, all required environmental regulatory approvals. A delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or failure to obtain and comply with them could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rates, tax rates and other fluctuations, including those resulting from changes in laws.\nOur revenues and expenses are collected and paid in different currencies, including the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. Fluctuations in the value of any such currency expose us to foreign exchange risk and could have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows, revenues and results of operations. We also have currency exchange exposure to the extent of a mismatch between foreign-currency denominated revenues and expenditures - in particular, where U.S. dollar revenues do not equal U.S. dollar expenditures. We are not currently using exchange rate derivatives to manage currency exchange rate risks. There are currently no significant restrictions on the repatriation of capital and distribution of earnings to foreign entities from any of the jurisdictions in which we operate. There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be imposed in the future.\nCompliance with new or amended tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We operate in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and Canada, and may therefore be subject to the tax laws and regulations of such jurisdictions. For instance, the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, and significantly affected U.S. tax law; it also affected our business and financial condition because historically, approximately 80% to 85% of our revenue has been derived from U.S. projects.\nWe base our tax positions upon our understanding of the tax laws of and applicable tax treaties in the various countries in which we have assets or conduct business activities. However, our tax positions are subject to review and possible challenges by taxing authorities, including allocation of income, transfer pricing and other complex issues. This includes adverse changes to the manner in which Canada, the United States and other countries tax local and foreign corporations and interpret or change their tax laws and applicable tax treaties. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which such jurisdictions may review our positions or assess additional taxes or interest and penalties on such taxes. In addition, our effective tax rate may be increased by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, our cash management strategies, local tax rates, or interpretations of tax laws.\nWe may be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings for a variety of claims, which could subject us to significant costs and judgments and divert management\u2019s attention from our business.\nFrom time to time we may become involved in litigation for a variety of claims relating to our operations, solutions, contracts, relationships or other circumstances, or may become involved in regulatory proceedings. We may also be subject to claims arising from personal injuries or workers\u2019 compensation occurring on our properties, including our manufacturing facilities. We are party to potentially material legal proceedings. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d We are not currently party to any material regulatory proceedings against us. The defense of litigation, including fees of legal counsel, expert witnesses and related costs, is expensive and difficult to forecast accurately. In general, such costs are unrecoverable even if we ultimately prevail in litigation and could represent a significant use of our capital resources. To defend lawsuits, it is also necessary for us to divert the attention and resources of officers and other employees from their normal business functions to gather evidence, give testimony and otherwise support litigation efforts.\nThe outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures, actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from our estimates for such contingent liabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully avoid, manage and defend such matters. If we are unsuccessful in defending any litigation or claims, we could face material judgments or awards against us, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to increased counterparty credit risk resulting from, among other things, an increase in the number of Distribution Partners and clients.\nContinued growth of our Distribution Partner network and client base increases our exposure to credit risk related to amounts due from our Distribution Partners and their clients. Our Distribution Partners purchase DIRTT Solutions from us directly. We routinely monitor the financial condition of our Distribution Partners and their clients, and review the credit history of our new Distribution Partners and their clients, to establish credit limits. While we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts that corresponds to our estimate of the credit risk of our Distribution Partners and their clients based on historical trends and economic circumstances, there can be no assurances that our estimates and assumptions regarding allowance for doubtful accounts will prove to be accurate. We could realize additional losses if Distribution Partners or their clients default on their outstanding balance beyond our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional capital or financing on acceptable terms.\nWe plan to continually invest in business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business opportunities. Such investments may relate to expanding sales and marketing activities; developing our Distribution Partner network; developing new software, products or features; enhancing our operating infrastructure; acquiring complementary businesses and technologies; expanding our manufacturing capacity; or investing in innovation and operational capacity ahead of anticipated growth, including commencing factory automation. To the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to meet our requirements, we may need to undertake equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities may result in significant share dilution. Additional new equity securities issued could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of currently issued and outstanding common shares.\nAdditional debt financings may involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. We cannot provide any assurance that sufficient debt or equity financing will be available for necessary or desirable expenditures or acquisitions, or to cover losses, and accordingly, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests.\nOn October 21, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as amended, the \u201cComerica Credit Facility\u201d) with Comerica Bank, as subsequently amended, pursuant to which we had access to a $18.0 million revolving operating facility. The Comerica Credit Facility expired on June 30, 2019.\nOn July 19, 2019, we entered into a C$50 million senior secured revolving credit facility with the Royal Bank of Canada (the \u201cRBC Credit Facility\u201d). The RBC Credit Facility includes covenants that, among other things, impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests. These covenants may restrict our ability to (i) make certain acquisitions or dispose of our property; (ii) consolidate, amalgamate, merge, or otherwise permit a material change in our corporate or capital structure; (iii) incur additional debt, other than permitted debt; (iv) permit encumbrances on certain assets to secure debt; and (v) pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our common shares or redeem, repurchase or retire our common shares or subordinated debt or make certain other restricted payments.\nWe are also required to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet these ratios could be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants or ratios may result in an event of default, or may limit our ability to borrow, under the RBC Credit Facility. If any such default occurs, the lender under the RBC Credit Facility may be able to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, or enforce their security interest. The lender may also have the right in these circumstances to terminate commitments to provide further borrowings.\nWe have experienced a history of losses, and despite certain periods of profitability in recent years, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since commencing business. We incurred net losses of $4.4 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $46.0 million. These losses and accumulated deficits were due in part to the substantial investments made to grow our business and acquire clients, to further develop our service offerings through product and software development, and to ensure that we have sufficient production capacity and capability to deliver on our commitment of rapid delivery times. Past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and there can be no assurance that we will generate net income in the future.\nWe may not have insurance adequate in amount or coverage to protect us from all claims that may arise in connection with our business and operations.\nWhile we currently maintain insurance of the types and amounts we consider commercially prudent and consistent with industry practice, including directors and officers, errors and omissions, property, and general liability insurance, we may not be fully insured against all risks incident to our business. There can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at commercially reasonable rates. There can also be no assurance that the amounts for which we are insured, or the proceeds of such insurance, will fully compensate us for any losses. In addition, the insurance coverage obtained with respect to our business and facilities will be subject to limits and exclusions or limitations on coverage that are considered by management to be reasonable, given the cost of procuring insurance and current operating conditions. If a significant event occurs that is not fully insured, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may engage in future mergers, acquisitions, agreements, consolidations or other corporate transactions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we have no specific plans to acquire any businesses, we may, in the future, seek to expand our business and capabilities through acquiring compatible technology, products or businesses. Additionally, we may explore other corporate transactions, including mergers, agreements, consolidations, or joint ventures, that we believe may be beneficial to our business or further specific business goals. Acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, (i) difficulty integrating the newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner; (ii) inability to maintain relationships with key clients, vendors and other business partners of the acquired businesses; (iii) potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; (iv) exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with our assumption of certain claims and liabilities of the acquired businesses; (v) diversion of management\u2019s time and focus; and (vi) possible write-offs or impairment charges related to the acquired business. The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTo the extent we are successful in identifying suitable businesses or products for acquisition, we may deem it necessary or advisable to finance such acquisitions through issuing common shares, securities convertible into common shares, debt financing, or a combination thereof. In such cases, issuing common shares or convertible securities could result in dilution to our shareholders at the time of such issuance or conversion. We may also pursue issuing debt to finance acquisitions, which may result in, among other things, the encumbrance of certain of our assets, impediment of our ability to obtain bank financing, and a decrease in our liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the TSX under the symbol \u201cDRT\u201d and on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cDRTT.\u201d The price of our common shares has in the past fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate significantly in the future, depending upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may adversely affect the market price of our common shares. These factors include: (i) variations in quarterly results of operations; (ii) deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance; (iii) changes in earnings estimates by analysts; (iv) our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; (v) general conditions in the offsite construction and manufacturing industries; (vi) sales of our common shares by our significant shareholders; (vii) fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and (viii) other general economic conditions.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation have been brought against that company. If our share price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation in both the United States and Canada. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe requirements of being a public company in the United States and Canada and maintaining a dual listing on both Nasdaq and the TSX, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and applicable securities laws of Canada, may strain our resources, increase our costs, and require significant management time and resources.\nAs a public company in the United States, we need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of Nasdaq, with which we are not required to comply as a public company in Canada listed on the TSX. Specifically, we may incur significant additional accounting, legal, reporting and other expenses in order to maintain a dual listing on both Nasdaq and the TSX, including the costs of listing on two exchanges. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements, as well as any applicable securities laws of Canada, occupies a significant amount of time of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and management and increases our costs and expenses, including an increased reliance on outside counsel and accountants. We also prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, in addition to applicable securities laws of Canada.\nShareholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which could then result in additional compliance costs and affect the manner in which we operate our business. Moreover, any new regulations or disclosure obligations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and may make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nFurthermore, while we generally must comply with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Exchange Act. Once it is required to do so, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and use significant management time and resources, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nIn addition, we expect that being a public company in the United States subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain or maintain additional director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain or maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in the future or the timing of such costs in order to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nFor as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements that apply to some other public companies, and such reduced disclosures requirement may make our Common Shares less attractive.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of exemptions from certain disclosure requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We are an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will not be required to, among other things:\n\u2022\nhave an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley;\n\u2022\ncomply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about our audit and our financial statements;\n\u2022\ninclude detailed compensation discussion and analysis in our filings under the Exchange Act and instead may provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nhold a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nBecause of these exemptions, some investors may find our common shares less attractive, which may result in a less active trading market for our common shares, and our share price may be more volatile.\nWe historically have not paid dividends on our common shares.\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends on common shares to date. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Board, taking into account our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under our credit facilities, and such other factors as the Board considers relevant. Our RBC Credit Facility generally limits our ability to pay any dividends or make any other distribution on our outstanding capital shares. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Credit Facility\u201d for more information.\nWe are governed by the corporate laws of Alberta, Canada, which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws of the United States.\nWe are governed by the ABCA and other relevant laws, which may affect the rights of shareholders differently than those of a company governed by the laws of a U.S. jurisdiction, and may, together with our charter documents, have the effect of delaying, deterring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of our company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or may affect the price an acquiring party would be willing to offer in such an instance. The material differences between the ABCA and Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), that may have the greatest such effect include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) for certain extraordinary corporate transactions (such as amalgamations or amendments to our articles), the ABCA generally requires the voting threshold to be a special resolution passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast by the shareholders who voted in respect of the resolution, whereas DGCL generally only requires a majority vote; and (ii) under the ABCA, registered holders or beneficial owners (as defined in the ABCA) of not less than 5% of our common shares in aggregate can requisition our directors to call a special meeting of shareholders, whereas such right does not exist under the DGCL. We cannot predict whether investors will find our company and our common shares less attractive because we are governed by foreign laws.\nBecause we are a corporation incorporated in Alberta and some of our directors and officers are resident in Canada, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce civil liabilities against us based solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States. Similarly, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to enforce civil liabilities against our directors and officers residing outside of Canada.\nWe are a corporation amalgamated and existing under the laws of Alberta with our principal place of business in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Some of our directors and officers are residents of Canada and a substantial portion of our assets and those of such persons are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for U.S. investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or to realize in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil liabilities under the Securities Act. Investors should not assume that Canadian courts: (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or blue sky laws of any state within the United States or (2) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state securities or blue sky laws.\nSimilarly, some of our directors and officers are residents of countries other than Canada and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside Canada. As a result, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to initiate a lawsuit within Canada against these non-Canadian residents. In addition, it may not be possible for Canadian investors to collect from these non-Canadian residents judgments obtained in courts in Canada predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities legislation of certain of the provinces and territories of Canada. It may also be difficult for Canadian investors to succeed in a lawsuit in the United States, based solely on violations of federal, provincial or territorial securities laws.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and cannot assure you that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our common shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe could be treated as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes under certain circumstances, which would have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of our common shares.\nA non-U.S. entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be treated as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d (a \u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if 75% or more of its gross income for any taxable year consists of passive income or 50% or more of the average value of its assets produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For purposes of these tests, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property, and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties that are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. We do not believe that we are currently a PFIC, and we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after the close of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the current taxable year or any future taxable year.\nIf we are or have been a PFIC in any taxable year, a U.S. Holder (as defined below) may incur significantly increased U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of our common shares and on the receipt of distributions on our common shares to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an \u201cexcess distribution\u201d under the U.S. federal income tax rules, and such holder may be subject to burdensome reporting requirements. Further, if we are a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our common shares, we generally will continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our common shares. Please see \u201cCertain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders - Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders if we are treated as a PFIC.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of our common shares that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes any of the following: an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or a trust (i) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more United States persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) which has made a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nNasdaq or the TSX may delist our securities from its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur securities may fail to meet the continued listing requirements to be listed on the Nasdaq or TSX. If Nasdaq or the TSX delists our common shares from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u2022\na determination that our common shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common shares;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.", "PERMNO": 19005, "SIC": 2522, "TIC": "DRTT"}
