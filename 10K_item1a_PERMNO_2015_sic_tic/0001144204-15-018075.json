{"cik": "1533998", "company": "LabStyle Innovations Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial conditions and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Company and our Business\nWe were formed in August 2011 and are thus subject to the risks associated with new businesses.\nWe were formed in August 2011 as a new business. As such, we are a development stage, \u201cstart-up\u201d company. We have no history of revenue-generating operations, and in general only have a short operating history by which you can assess our company and our prospects. We commenced an initial \u201csoft\u201d launch of the Dario\u2122 application in December 2013 and the Dario\u2122 Smart Meter in March 2014 in targeted jurisdictions and continued such initial launch during 2014. These efforts have generated little revenue, and it is still too early to predict if we will be able to generate significant revenues over the next 12 months. Therefore, we are, and expect for the foreseeable future to be, subject to all the risks and uncertainties, inherent in a new business and the development and sale of new medical devices and related software application. As a result, we still must establish many functions necessary to operate a business, including finalizing our managerial and administrative structure, continuing product and technology development, assessing and commencing our marketing activities, implementing financial systems and controls and personnel recruitment.\nAccordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their initial revenue generating stages, particularly those in the medical device and mobile heath fields. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a new company with a no operating history will face. In particular, potential investors should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u00b7 implement or execute our current business plan, or that our business plan is sound;\n\u00b7 maintain our management team and Board of Directors;\n\u00b7 raise sufficient funds in the capital markets or otherwise to effectuate our business plan;\n\u00b7 determine that the processes and technologies that we have developed are commercially viable; and/or\n\u00b7 attract, enter into or maintain contracts with, and retain customers.\nIf we cannot execute any one of the foregoing, our business may fail, in which case you would lose the entire amount of your investment in our company.\nGiven our limited revenue and lack of positive cash flow, we will need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to us or, even if consummated, may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on our ability to operate.\nAccording to our management\u2019s estimates, based on our current cash on hand and further based on our budget and the assumption that initial commercial sales will commence during our anticipated timeframes, we believe that we will have sufficient resources to continue our activities only into July 2015.\nSince we might be unable to generate sufficient, if any, revenue or cash flow to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we will need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations. We may also need additional funding for developing products and services, increasing our sales and marketing capabilities, promoting brand identity, and acquiring complementary companies, technologies and assets, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes. Moreover, the regulatory compliance arising out of being a publicly registered company has dramatically increased our costs.\nWe do not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Given our need for cash and that equity raising is the most common type of fundraising for companies like ours, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for stockholders of our company.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on our assets, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, could increase our expenses and require that our assets be provided as a security for such debt. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or candidate products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFunding from any source may be unavailable to us on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly due to certain offering participation rights afforded to investors in private placement which closed in February 2014 (which we refer to as the February 2014 Private Placement) as well as preemptive rights held by the lead investor in our private placement which closed in September 2014 (which we refer to as the September 2014 Private Placement). If we do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations and expenses, we may not be able to achieve or maintain competitiveness, which could lead to the failure of our business and the loss of your investment.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. As such, you cannot rely upon our historical operating performance to make an investment decision regarding our company.\nFrom our inception in August 2011 and through December 31, 2014, we have recorded significant losses. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2014 was approximately $36 million. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to launch Dario\u2122 in Europe, obtain the required regulatory approvals in the U.S. and elsewhere and manufacture, market and sell Dario\u2122 where approved. We may be unable to achieve any or all of these goals.\nSince our inception, we have engaged primarily in research and development activities. This limited operating history may not be adequate to enable you to fully assess our ability to develop and commercialize Dario\u2122, obtain FDA clearance and achieve market acceptance of Dario\u2122 and respond to competition. We may be unable to fully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, commercialize, manufacture, market, sell and derive material revenues from Dario\u2122 in the timeframes we project, if at all, and our inability to do so would materially and adversely impact our viability as a company.\nWe may not generate revenue in the manner in which we anticipate. Further, we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nSince our initial product, Dario\u2122, received CE certification in September 2013, we have invested our resources in establishing our production lines and other necessary systems required for commercial sales. We commenced an initial \u201csoft\u201d launch of the Dario\u2122 application in December 2013 and the Dario\u2122 Smart Meter in March 2014 in targeted jurisdictions and continued such initial launch during 2014. These efforts have generated little revenue, and it is still too early to predict if we will be able to generate significant revenues over the next 12 months, and there is a risk that we will not be able to do so in accordance with our anticipated time frame or at all.\nMoreover, because of the various risks and uncertainties associated with developing, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and requirements for, manufacturing, marketing and selling Dario\u2122, we are unable to predict with any certainty the extent of any future revenues, cash flows, profits or losses or when we will generate positive cash flow or become profitable, if at all. We expect that we will continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we attempt to expand our sales. These losses, among other things, will have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Failure to generate revenue or achieve profitability would materially adversely affect the value of our company and our ability to establish and grow our business.\nWe cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of any future sales, making the timing of any revenues difficult to predict.\nWe may be faced with lengthy customer evaluation and approval processes associated with both the Dario\u2122 application and device. Consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense in developing customer adoption of Dario\u2122, which may not result in revenue generation. We must also obtain regulatory approvals of Dario\u2122 in the U.S. and other non-European jurisdictions as well as approval for insurance reimbursement in order to initiate sales of Dario\u2122, each of which is subject to risk and potential delays, and neither of which may actually occur. As such, we cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of any future sales.\nIf Dario\u2122 fails to satisfy current or future customer requirements, we may be required to make significant expenditures to redesign the product, and we may have insufficient resources to do so.\nDario\u2122 is being designed to address an evolving marketplace and must comply with current and evolving customer requirements in order to gain market acceptance. There is a risk that Dario\u2122 will not meet anticipated customer requirements or desires. If we are required to redesign our products to address customer demands or otherwise modify our business model, we may incur significant unanticipated expenses and losses, and we may be left with insufficient resources to engage in such activities. If we are unable to redesign our products, develop new products or modify our business model to meet customer desires or any other customer requirements that may emerge, our operating results would be materially adversely affected and our business might fail.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed in its report to our 2014 audited financial statements a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are an early stage company, and the development and commercialization of our product is uncertain and expected to require substantial expenditures. We have not yet generated sufficient revenues from our operations to fund our activities, and are therefore dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. There is a risk that we will be unable to obtain necessary financing to continue our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed in its auditors\u2019 report on the financial statements included as part of this Annual Report a substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in the common stock.\nWe expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from our principal technology, which leaves us subject to the risk of reliance on such technology.\nWe expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of products derived from our principal technology. Our initial product utilizing this technology is Dario\u2122. As such, any factor adversely affecting sales of Dario\u2122, including the product release cycles, regulatory issues, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition and economic and market conditions, would likely harm our operating results. We may be unable to develop other products utilizing our technology, which would likely lead to the failure of our business.\nMoreover, in spite of our efforts related to the registration of our technology, if patent protection is not available for our principal technology, the viability of Dario\u2122 and any other products that may be derived from such technology would likely be adversely impacted to a significant degree, which would materially impair our prospects.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors may become subject to conflicts of interests given their association with other biotechnology or medical device businesses.\nCertain of our directors and officers are, or may become, in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling stockholders and/or partners of or advisors to other entities engaged in a variety of businesses, including in the biotechnology or medical device sector. Thus, there is a risk that these individuals may become subject to conflicts of interest relating to our business given their participation with such other businesses, including, among other things, conflicts relating to time, effort and corporate opportunities. We do not presently have a formal policy for resolving such conflicts of interest should they arise, and the inability to resolve such conflicts should they arise could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur future performance will depend on the continued engagement of key members of our management team.\nOur future performance depends to a large extent on the continued services of members of our current management including, in particular, Erez Raphael, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chairman of our Board of Directors, Zvi Ben David, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary. In the event that we lose the continued services of such key personnel for any reason, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, scientific and technical personnel, we may not be able to implement our business model successfully.\nWe believe that our management team must be able to act decisively to apply and adapt our business model in the rapidly changing markets in which we will compete. In addition, we will rely upon technical and scientific employees or third party contractors to effectively establish, manage and grow our business. Consequently, we believe that our future viability will depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, scientific and technical personnel. In order to do so, we may need to pay higher compensation or fees to our employees or consultants than we currently expect and such higher compensation payments would have a negative effect on our operating results. Competition for experienced, high-quality personnel is intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel. We may not be able to hire or retain the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy. Our failure to hire and retain such personnel could impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively.\nWe are subject to the risk of reliance on third parties to manufacture and supply our product.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of Dario\u2122. We lack the resources and the capability to manufacture Dario\u2122 on a commercial scale. If our manufacturing partners are unable to produce our products in the amounts that we require, we may not be able to establish a contract and obtain a sufficient alternative supply from another supplier on a timely basis and in the quantities we require. We currently depend, and expect to depend for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturers.\nDario\u2122 requires, and our future product candidates, if any, likely will require precise, high quality manufacturing. Any of our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with quality system regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and other applicable government regulations and corresponding standards. If our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with quality system regulations, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business.\nAny performance failure on the part of our contract manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory clearance of our product candidates or commercialization of our future product candidates, depriving us of potential product revenue and resulting in additional losses. In addition, our dependence on a third-party for manufacturing may adversely affect our future profit margins. Our ability to replace an existing manufacturer may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement manufacturer before it can begin manufacturing our product candidates. Such clearance would require additional non-clinical testing and compliance inspections. It may be difficult or impossible for us to identify and engage a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all.\nSupply problems could harm our business.\nOur initial product, Dario\u2122, will initially be marketed primarily through local distribution partners but also, and increasingly over time, via the Internet. Our ability to generate sales of Dario\u2122 will depend on our ability to:\n\u00b7 procure components such as strips and lancets, cartridges, connectors and other on a timely basis from a limited number of suppliers and manufactures;\n\u00b7 properly coordinate efforts with our distribution partners;\n\u00b7 assemble and ship products to consumers on a timely basis with appropriate quality control;\n\u00b7 develop online distribution and shipment processes; and\n\u00b7 manage inventory and develop processes to deliver customer support.\nOur inability to achieve any of the foregoing could significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\nWe anticipate that in the future we will generally commit to purchase component parts from suppliers based on sales forecasts of our products. If we cannot change or be released from these non-cancelable purchase commitments, and if orders for our products do not materialize, we could incur significant costs related to the purchase of excess components which could become obsolete before we can use them. Additionally, a delay in production of the components or inaccuracy in our sales forecast could materially adversely impact our operating results if we are unable to timely ship ordered products or provide replacement parts under warranty or maintenance contracts.\nWe are subject to the risk of reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical trial work.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials. Contract research organizations may also assist us in the collection and analysis of data. These investigators and contract research organizations will not be our employees and we will not be able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including time that they devote to products that we develop. If independent investigators fail to devote sufficient resources to our clinical trials, or if their performance is substandard, it will delay the approval or clearance and commercialization of any products that we develop. Further, the FDA and other regulatory bodies around the world require that we comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial subjects are protected. If our independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations fail to comply with good clinical practice, the results of our clinical trials could be called into question and the clinical development of our product candidates could be delayed. Failure of clinical investigators or contract research organizations to meet their obligations to us or comply with federal regulations could adversely affect the clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business. Moreover, we intend to have several clinical trials in order to support our marketing efforts and business development purposes. Such clinical trials will be conducted by third parties as well. Failure of such clinical trials to meet their primary endpoints could adversely affect our marketing efforts.\nFailure in our online and digital marketing efforts could significantly impact our ability to generate sales.\nIn several of our principal target markets, we plan to utilize online and digital marketing in order to create awareness to Dario\u2122. Our management believes that using online advertisement through affiliate networks and a variety of other pay-for-performance methods will be superior for marketing and generating sales of Dario\u2122 rather than utilizing traditional, expensive retail channels. However, there is a risk that our marketing strategy could fail. Because we plan to use non-traditional retail sales tools and to rely on healthcare providers to educate our customers about Dario\u2122, we cannot predict the level of success, if any, that we may achieve by marketing Dario\u2122 via the Internet. The failure of our online marketing efforts would significantly and negatively impact our ability to generate sales.\nOur Dario\u2122 smart mobile application, which is a key to our business model, is available via Apple\u2019s iOS and via Google\u2019s Android platforms and maybe in the future via additional platforms. If we are unable to achieve or maintain a good relationship with each of Apple and Google or similar platforms, or if the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store or any other applicable platform were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.\nA key component of the Dario\u2122 solution is an iPhone or Android application which includes incorporate tools to help diabetic patients manage their disease. This application is compatible with Apple\u2019s iOS and with Google\u2019s Android platforms and may in the future become compatible via additional platforms. If we are unable to make our Dario\u2122 application compatible with these platforms, or if there is any deterioration in our relationship with either Apple or Google or others after our application is available, our business would be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to each of Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on their respective storefronts. Each of Apple and Google has broad discretion to change its standard terms and conditions, including changes which could require us to pay to have our Dario\u2122 application available for downloading. In addition, these standard terms and conditions can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by Apple or Google. We may not receive any advance warning of such changes. In addition, each of Apple and Google have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions. In the event that either Apple or Google ever determines that we are in violation of its standard terms and conditions, including by a new interpretation, and prohibits us from distributing our Dario\u2122 application on its storefront, it would materially harm our business.\nAdditionally, we will rely on the continued function of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store as digital storefronts where our Dario\u2122 application may be obtained. There have been occasions in the past when these digital storefronts were unavailable for short periods of time or where there have been issues with the in-app purchasing functionality within the storefront. In the event that either the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store is unavailable or if in-app purchasing functionality within the storefront is non-operational for a prolonged period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of our customers to secure the Dario\u2122 application, which would materially harm our business.\nAs we conduct business internationally, we are susceptible to risks associated with international relationships.\nWe operate our business internationally, presently in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Canada and subsequently in the United States and other markets. The international operation of our business will require significant management attention, which could negatively affect our business if it diverts their attention from their other responsibilities. In the event that we are unable to manage the complications associated with international operations, our business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, doing business with foreign customers subjects us to additional risks that we do not generally face in the United States. These risks and uncertainties include:\n\u00b7 management, communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion;\n\u00b7 localization of products and services, including translation of foreign languages;\n\u00b7 delivery, logistics and storage costs;\n\u00b7 longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 difficulties supporting international operations;\n\u00b7 difficulties supporting customer services;\n\u00b7 changes in economic and political conditions;\n\u00b7 impact of trade protection measures;\n\u00b7 complying with import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 competition from companies with international operations, including large international competitors and entrenched local companies;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences, including foreign tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7 maintaining and servicing computer hardware in distant locations;\n\u00b7 keeping current and complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards, including local labor laws;\n\u00b7 securing or maintaining protection for our intellectual property; and\n\u00b7 reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights, including the ability to transfer such rights to third parties, in some countries.\nThe occurrence of any or all of these risks could adversely affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause we expect to conduct a material portion of our business outside of the United States but report our financial results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. Our foreign operations will be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results are translated from the local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenue, operating expenses and net income. As exchange rates vary, sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from our or the capital market\u2019s expectations.\nNon-U.S. governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market Dario\u2122 and our future product candidates, if any, in both the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more non-U.S. jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our products. In some countries, particularly countries of the European Union, each of which has developed its own rules and regulations, pricing may be subject to governmental control under certain circumstances. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a medical device candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available products. If reimbursement of our product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur Dario\u2122 Smart Meter, software application and associated business processes may contain undetected errors, which could limit our ability to provide our services and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings.\nDario\u2122 (including the Smart Meter and software application) may contain undetected errors, defects or bugs. As a result, our customers or end users may discover errors or defects in our devices, software or the systems we design, or the products or systems incorporating our designs and intellectual property may not operate as expected. We may discover significant errors or defects in the future that we may not be able to fix. Our inability to fix any of those errors could limit our ability to provide our products, impair the reputation of our brand and diminish the attractiveness of our product offerings to our customers.\nIn addition, we may utilize third party technology or components in our products and we rely on those third parties to provide support services to us. Failure of those third parties to provide necessary support services could materially adversely impact our business.\nAs our operating subsidiary is in Israel, we will be faced with the risks associated with doing business in that country.\nOur operating subsidiary, along with our management team and our research and development facilities, is located in Israel. Although substantially all of our sales will be made to consumers outside Israel and the manufacturing of Dario\u2122 will be based primarily on parts made in other countries, we are and will nonetheless be directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Furthermore, several countries restrict business with Israeli companies, which may impair our ability to create new business relationships or otherwise conduct our business. In addition, Israel\u2019s economy has been subject to numerous destabilizing factors, including a period of rampant inflation in the early to middle 1980s, low foreign exchange reserves, fluctuations in world commodity prices, military conflicts and civil unrest. These restrictions, continuing or escalating hostilities in the region or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, including our ability to develop, manufacture and market our products.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe failure to obtain or maintain patents, licensing agreements and other intellectual property could materially impact our ability to compete effectively.\nIn order for our business to be viable and to compete effectively, we need to develop and maintain, and we will heavily rely on, our proprietary position with respect to our technologies and intellectual property. We filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (or PCT) application for a \u201cFLUIDS TESTING APPARATUS AND METHODS OF USE\u201d in May 2011 (PCT/IL2012/000369) which incorporates two U.S. provisional applications submitted in the preceding year. The PCT covers the specific processes related to blood glucose level measurement as well as more general methods of rapid tests of body fluids and has subsequently been converted into several national phase patent applications. We have also filed a significant number of other patent applications for aspects of both the Dario\u2122 Smart Meter and software. We have also obtained numerous Web domains.\nHowever, to date, we have only been issued one patent (which was issued in the United States) relating to how the Dario\u2122 blood glucose monitor draws power from and transmits data to a smart phone via the audio jack port. None of our other patents have been granted by a patent office. In addition, there are significant risks associated with our actual or proposed intellectual property. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our pending patent and other proprietary rights principally include the following:\n\u00b7 pending patent applications we have filed or will file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to opposition proceedings in foreign countries;\n\u00b7 any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7 other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us;\n\u00b7 other companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;\n\u00b7 other companies may design their technologies around technologies we have licensed or developed; and\n\u00b7 enforcement of patents is complex, uncertain and very expensive.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any of our pending or future applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make our inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions.\nIt is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we have licensed, our rights depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so.\nIn addition to patents and patent applications, we depend upon trademarks, trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our proprietary technology. We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of our confidential information to any other parties. We will also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. These agreements may not, however, provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure in violation of these agreements.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims alleging the violation of the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe may face significant expense and liability as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and intellectual property rights of others. In the event that another party has also filed a patent application or been issued a patent relating to an invention or technology claimed by us in pending applications, we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial uncertainties and costs for us, even if the eventual outcome was favorable to us. We, or our licensors, also could be required to participate in interference proceedings involving issued patents and pending applications of another entity. An adverse outcome in an interference proceeding could require us to cease using the technology, substantially modify it or to license rights from prevailing third parties.\nThe cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding relating to our licensed patents or patent applications, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, especially given our early stage of development. Our ability to enforce our patent protection could be limited by our financial resources, and may be subject to lengthy delays. A third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as research, development and the sale of any future products. Such lawsuits are expensive and would consume significant time and other resources. There is a risk that a court will decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and will order us to stop the activities claimed by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having infringed their patents.\nMoreover, there is no guarantee that any prevailing patent owner would offer us a license so that we could continue to engage in activities claimed by the patent, or that such a license, if made available to us, could be acquired on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, third parties may, in the future, assert other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to our services, technologies or other matters.\nInternational patent protection is particularly uncertain, and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries we may have to expend substantial sums and management resources.\nPatent and other intellectual property law outside the United States is even more uncertain than in the United States and is continually undergoing review and revisions in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to business methods and processes. In addition, we may have to participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors\u2019 foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe face intense competition in the self monitoring of blood glucose market, and as a result we may be unable to effectively compete in our industry.\nWith our first product, Dario\u2122, we expect to compete directly and primarily with large pharmaceutical and medical device companies: Abbott Laboratories, Bayer Healthcare Division, Johnson & Johnson LifeScan, Roche Diagnostics and Sanofi. The first four of these companies have more than 90% combined market shares of the SMBG business and strong research and development capacity for next generation products. Their dominant market position since the late 1990s and significant control over the market could significantly limit our ability to introduce Dario\u2122 or effectively market and generate sales of the product. We will also compete with numerous second-tier and third-tier competitors.\nWe are a \u201cstart-up\u201d company with no meaningful history of operations, and most of our competitors have long histories and strong reputations within the industry. They have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do. They also have more experience and capabilities in researching and developing testing products, obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances and other requirements, manufacturing and marketing those products than we do. There is a significant risk that we may be unable to overcome the advantages held by our competition, and our inability to do so could lead to the failure of our business and the loss of your investment.\nCompetition in the SMBG markets is extremely intense, which can lead to, among other things, price reductions, longer selling cycles, lower product margins, loss of market share and additional working capital requirements. To succeed, we must, among other critical matters, gain consumer acceptance for Dario\u2122 and potential future products incorporating our principal technology and offer better strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of other competitors. If our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products, we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Moreover, any broad-based changes to our prices and pricing policies could make it difficult to generate revenues or cause our revenues, if established, to decline. Some of our competitors may bundle certain software products at low prices for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy. These practices could significantly reduce demand for Dario\u2122 or potential future products or constrain prices we can charge. Moreover, if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective or desirable than Dario\u2122 or the other products that we may develop, we may not convince our customers to use our products. Any such changes would likely reduce our commercial opportunity and revenue potential and could materially adversely impact our operating results.\nIt may be difficult for us to establish market acceptance of Dario\u2122, which would significantly impair our viability.\nWe are faced with the risk that the marketplace will not be receptive to Dario\u2122 over competing products and that we will be unable to compete effectively. Failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could affect our ability to establish Dario\u2122 or any potential future products include:\n\u00b7 the development of products or platforms and design and methodology services, which could result in a shift of customer preferences away from our products and services and significantly decrease revenue;\n\u00b7 the increased use of improved diabetes drugs that could encourage certain diabetics to test less often, resulting in less usage of self-monitoring test device for certain types of diabetics;\n\u00b7 the challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed) technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;\n\u00b7 the significant number of current competitors in SMBG market who have significantly greater name recognition and more recognizable trademarks and who have established relationships with diabetics healthcare providers and payors; and\n\u00b7 intense competition to attract acquisition targets, which may make it more difficult for us to acquire companies or technologies at an acceptable price or at all.\nIf we are unable to establish market acceptance of Dario\u2122, our business would likely fail and you would lose your investment in our company.\nIf we fail to respond quickly to technological developments our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete.\nThe SMBG market and other markets in which we plan to compete experience rapid technology developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to respond quickly to these developments, we may lose competitive position, and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete, causing revenues and operating results to suffer. In order to compete, we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum and designers and designer expertise in our industries. We must also be able to support a range of changing customer preferences. For instance, as non-invasive technologies become more readily available in the market, we may be required to adopt our platform to accommodate the use of non-invasive or continuous blood glucose sensors. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in any manner in these efforts.\nThe regulatory clearance process which we must navigate is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining clearance for the commercialization of Dario\u2122 or our future product candidates, if any.\nThe research, design, testing, manufacturing, labeling, selling, marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country.\nWe will not be permitted to market Dario\u2122 outside of Europe, including in the United States or elsewhere, until we receive regulatory clearance. In the U.S., regulatory clearance would take the form of a clearance letter under the 510(k) premarket notification process, or approval of a Section 515 premarket approval (or PMA) from the FDA, depending on the nature of the device. Although we have received CE Mark Certificate to market Dario\u2122 in Europe and have submitted and subsequently resubmitted our 501(k) application in the U.S., we have not yet received regulatory clearance from the U.S. or other non-European jurisdictions. Obtaining clearance of any premarket application can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. While the FDA normally reviews and clears a premarket notification in three months, there is no guarantee that our products will qualify for this more expeditious regulatory process, which is reserved for Class I and II devices, nor is there any assurance that, even if a device is reviewed under the 510(k) premarket notification process, the FDA will review it expeditiously or determine that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed premarket notification device. If the FDA fails to make this finding, then we cannot market the device. In lieu of acting on a premarket notification, the FDA may seek additional information or additional data which would further delay our ability to market the product. In addition, failure to comply with FDA, non-U.S. regulatory authorities or other applicable U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory requirements may, either before or after product clearance or approval, if any, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7 restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n\u00b7 adverse inspectional observations (Form 483), warning letters or non-warning letters incorporating inspectional observations;\n\u00b7 civil and criminal penalties;\n\u00b7 injunctions;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u00b7 product seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u00b7 total or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7 imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u00b7 refusal to clear or approve pending applications or premarket notifications.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a medical device candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 a medical device candidate may not be deemed safe or effective, in the case of a premarket approval application;\n\u00b7 a medical device candidate may not be deemed to be substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed non-premarket approval device in the case of a 510(k) premarket notification;\n\u00b7 FDA officials may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and our Dario\u2122 clinical trial (or any future trials) sufficient;\n\u00b7 the FDA might not approve our third-party manufacturer\u2019s processes or facilities; or\n\u00b7 the FDA may change its clearance or approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nWe may be unable to complete required clinical trials, or we may experience significant delays in completing such clinical trials, which could significantly delay our targeted product launch timeframe and impair our viability and business plan.\nThe completion of any future clinical trials for Dario\u2122 or other trials that we may be required to undertake in the future could be delayed, suspended or terminated for several reasons, including:\n\u00b7 our failure or inability to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 sites participating in the trial may drop out of the trial, which may require us to engage new sites for an expansion of the number of sites that are permitted to be involved in the trial;\n\u00b7 patients may not enroll in, remain in or complete, the clinical trial at the rates we expect; and\n\u00b7 clinical investigators may not perform our clinical trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices.\nIf our clinical trial is delayed it will take us longer to ultimately commercialize Dario\u2122 and generate revenues. Moreover, our development costs will increase if we have material delays in our clinical trial or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. We may be faced with similar risks in connection with future trials we conduct.\nOur failure to meet or maintain necessary or potential regulatory requirements, in relevant target markets, could hurt our ability to distribute and market Dario\u2122.\nDario\u2122 or our potential future products may fall under the regulatory purview of various centers at the FDA as described above and similar health authorities in foreign regions or countries where we intend to do business, such as in the European Union. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process may take from three to twelve months, or longer, and may or may not require additional human clinical data. The premarket approval process may take from eleven months to three years, or even longer, and will likely require significant supporting human clinical data.\nIn addition, on September 23, 2013, the FDA issued final Guidance for developers of mobile medical applications, or apps, which are software programs that run on mobile communication devices and perform the same functions as traditional medical devices. The Guidance outlines the FDA\u2019s tailored approach to mobile apps. The FDA plans to exercise enforcement discretion (meaning it will not enforce requirements under the Federal Drug & Cosmetic Act) for the majority of mobile apps as they pose minimal risk to consumers. The FDA plans to focus its regulatory oversight on a subset of mobile medical apps that present a greater risk to patients if they do not work as intended. We anticipate that the Dario\u2122 application will be subject to the FDA regulation as a \u201cmobile medical app.\u201d\nDelays in obtaining the regulatory clearance or approval from the FDA or its equivalents in foreign market could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. We cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize Dario\u2122 in jurisdictions in which we have not received regulatory clearance or approval.\nWe may also become subject to numerous post-marketing regulatory requirements, which include labeling regulations and medical device reporting regulations, which may require us to report to different regulatory agencies if our device causes or contributes to a death or serious injury, or malfunctions in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. In addition, these regulatory requirements may change in the future in a way that adversely affects us. If we fail to comply with present or future regulatory requirements that are applicable to us, we may be subject to enforcement action by regulatory agencies, which may include, among others, any of the following sanctions:\n\u00b7 untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u00b7 customer notification, or orders for repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our current or future products;\n\u00b7 imposing operating restrictions, suspension or shutdown of production;\n\u00b7 refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to Dario\u2122 or future products;\n\u00b7 rescinding 510(k) clearance or suspending or withdrawing pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u00b7 criminal prosecution.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we or our manufacturers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation or any applicable state equivalent, our operations could be interrupted and our operating results could suffer.\nWe, our manufacturers and suppliers must, unless specifically exempt by regulation, follow the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (QSR) and are also subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process. If our affiliates, our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in significant non-compliance or fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to adverse QSR inspectional findings, the FDA could take enforcement actions against us and our manufacturers which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. Accordingly, our operating results could suffer.\nHealthcare policy changes, including ongoing efforts to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nDario\u2122 utilizes a standard electrochemical glucose testing method and is expected to benefit from existing regulatory approvals worldwide for traditional, non-disposable monitors, test-strips and lancets, in order to have a more rapid pathway to market. However, the SMBG markets have experienced downward pressure on product pricing because the Federal and state governments have made various cost containment efforts on health care expenditures. Furthermore, the industry faces uncertainty brought by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and of any potential healthcare reform that could impact tax and reimbursement rates. The implementation of these laws or the adoption of healthcare reform proposals in the future could thus impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or third-party payers. These limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe anticipate that legislation could change access to health care products, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases, or cap reimbursement rates for medical devices. We also anticipate that legislation could impose sales or excise tax on the medical device manufacturing sector. Any change on medical device taxation and downward trending reimbursement rates would directly impact all aspects of our industry, including our operations and the demand for our products. To the extent such cost containment efforts are not offset by the growth of diabetics population, greater patient access to healthcare and other factors, our future revenues and operating income would be reduced.\nWe may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations.\nMany federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations apply to the SMBG business and medical devices. We may be subject to certain federal and state regulations, including the federal healthcare programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Law, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and other federal and state false claims laws. The medical device industry has been under heightened scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and enforcement actions involving manufacturers who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business, including arrangements with physician consultants. If our operations or arrangements are found to be in violation of such governmental regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment of our operations. All of these penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nProduct liability suits, whether or not meritorious, could be brought against us due to an alleged defective product or for the misuse of Dario\u2122 or our potential future products. These suits could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages, and an increase in our insurance rates.\nIf Dario\u2122 or any of our future products are defectively designed or manufactured contain defective components or are misused, or if someone claims any of the foregoing, whether or not meritorious, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation. Misusing our device or failing to adhere to the operating guidelines or the device producing inaccurate meter readings could cause significant harm to patients, including death. In addition, if our operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, we may be subject to liability. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. We presently have no insurance against such claims, and even if we are able to obtain such insurance (of which no assurances can be given), we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and could reduce revenue. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our results of operations.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nPart of our business plan includes the storage and potential monetization of medical data of users of Dario\u2122. There are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. We may face difficulties in holding such information in compliance with applicable law. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur officers, directors and founding stockholders may exert significant influence over our affairs, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur officers, directors and affiliated stockholders (including Dicilyon Consulting and Investment Ltd., an affiliate of David Edery) collectively have an approximately 41.84% beneficial ownership of our company. As a result, such individuals will have the ability, acting together, to control the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our company, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders and be disadvantageous to our stockholders with interests different from those individuals. Certain of these individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers or directors of our company. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our company.\nDicilyon Consulting and Investment Ltd., an affiliate of investor David Edery, has the right to appoint up to three members of our Board of Directors, which affords such investor the potential for control over our business.\nDicilyon Consulting and Investment Ltd., an affiliate of investor David Edery (who was the lead investor in our September 2014 Private Placement), has the right, for so long as such investor holds 25%, 15% and 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, such investor shall have the right to appoint, respectively, three, two or one member of our seven person Board of Directors. Mr. Edery is the sole shareholder of Dicilyon Consulting and Investment Ltd. To date, such investor has appointed three members of our Board of Directors (Rami Yehudiha, Hila Karah and Peter Kash, although as of the date of this Annual Report, Dr. Kash is not serving on our Board of Directors). As a result, such investor has significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors which, in turn, affords such investor the potential for material control over our business.\nWe may be unable to establish a liquid market for our common stock due to the manner in which we became a publicly reporting company.\nBecause we did not become an SEC reporting company by the traditional means of conducting an initial public offering of our common stock, but rather through a self-registration process, we may be unable to establish a liquid market for our common stock. Moreover, we do not expect security analysts of brokerage firms to provide coverage of our company in the near future. In addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite primary or secondary offerings on behalf of our company or its stockholders in the future than they would if we had become a public reporting company by means of an initial public offering of common stock. If all or any of the foregoing risks occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our company.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nA sustained, active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be maintained.\nAs we are in our early stages, an investment in our company will likely require a long-term commitment, with no certainty of return. Although our common stock is listed for quotation on the OTCQB market under the symbol of DRIO, and although in 2014 we experienced historically high trading value in our common stock, we cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will ever develop or be sustained in the future. In the absence of an active trading market:\n\u00b7 investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;\n\u00b7 market visibility for shares of our common stock may be limited; and\n\u00b7 a lack of visibility for shares of our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThe OTCQB market is relatively unorganized, inter-dealer, over-the-counter markets that provide significantly less liquidity than NASDAQ or the NYSE MKT (formerly known as the NYSE AMEX). In this event, there would be a highly illiquid market for our common stock and you may be unable to dispose of your common stock at desirable prices or at all. Moreover, there is a risk that our common stock could be delisted from the OTCQB, in which case it might be listed on the so called \u201cPink Sheets\u201d, which is even more illiquid than the OTCQB.\nThe lack of an active market impairs your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be significantly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial or operational estimates or projections;\n\u00b7 conditions in markets generally;\n\u00b7 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u00b7 general economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere.\nIn particular, the market prices for securities of mHealth and medical device have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7 any delay in or the results of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 any delay in manufacturing of our products;\n\u00b7 any delay with the approval for reimbursement for the patients from their insurance companies;\n\u00b7 our failure to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 the announcements of clinical trial data, and the investment community\u2019s perception of and reaction to those data;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials conducted by others on products that would compete with ours;\n\u00b7 any delay or failure to receive clearance or approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies or bodies;\n\u00b7 our inability to commercially launch products or market and generate sales of our products, including Dario\u2122;\n\u00b7 failure of Dario\u2122 or any other products, even if approved for marketing, to achieve any level of commercial success;\n\u00b7 our failure to obtain patent protection for any of our technologies and products (including those related to Dario\u2122) or the issuance of third party patents that cover our proposed technologies or products;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our product\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 our or our competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u00b7 general and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our expenditures;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents;\n\u00b7 failure to adequately manufacture Dario\u2122 or any other products through third parties;\n\u00b7 future sales of our common stock or other securities, including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or otherwise issued pursuant to certain contractual rights;\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n\u00b7 low or high trading volume of our common stock due to many factors, including the terms of our financing arrangements;\nIn addition, if we fail to reach an important research, development or commercialization milestone or result by a publicly expected deadline, even if by only a small margin, there could be significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Additionally, as we approach the announcement of anticipated significant information and as we announce such information, we expect the price of our common stock to be particularly volatile, and negative results would have a substantial negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn some cases, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our business operations and reputation.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nWe have a material number of shares of common stock underlying outstanding warrants and options of our company as well as underlying the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued in our September 2014 Private Placement, the future sale of which could depress the price of our publicly-traded stock. As of December 31, 2014: (i) 1,317,400 shares of common stock are issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $6.59 per share; (ii) 9,882,025 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants at a weighted average exercise price of $2.06 per share and (iii) 10,507,525 shares of common stock are issuable upon the conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. If and when these securities are exercised or converted into shares of our common stock, our outstanding shares will increase. Such increase in our outstanding securities, and any sales of such shares, could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, from time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six month holding period: (i) affiliated stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated stockholders may sell without such limitations, provided we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one year holding period without any limitation or restriction. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale report may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nThe right of the investors in our February 2014 Private Placement and the lead investor in our September 2014 Private Placement to participate in future financings of ours could impair our ability to raise capital.\nUnder the securities purchase agreement with the investors in our February 2014 Private Placement, as amended, for a period ending on February 12, 2016, in the event that we seek to raise money through the offer and sale of debt or equity securities, we must first offer such investors a right to participate in at least 35% of the securities we propose to offer in such funding. In addition, an affiliate of David Edery, the lead investor in our September 2014 Private Placement, holds preemptive rights until September 23, 2016 allow such investor to participate in future financings of our company in an amount necessary to maintain its fully-diluted percentage interest in our company. The existence of such right of participation or preemptive rights, or the exercise of such rights, may in the deter potential investors from providing us needed financing, or may deter investment banks from working with, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our company which, in turn, could lead to our inability to continue our business.\nWe may not maintain qualification for OTCQB inclusion, and therefore you may be unable to sell your shares.\nOur common stock became eligible for an un-priced quotation on the OTCQB on April 8, 2013. We are also required to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and to be current in our periodic securities reporting obligations.\nHowever, trading of our common stock could be suspended. If for any reason our common stock does not become eligible or maintain eligibility for quotation on the OTCQB or a public trading market does not develop, purchasers of shares of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares should they desire to do so. If we are unable to satisfy the requirements for quotation on the OTCQB, any quotation of in our common stock could be conducted in the \u201cpink\u201d sheets market. As a result, a purchaser of our common stock may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of their shares. This would materially and adversely affect the liquidity of our securities.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements, which could leave our stockholders without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u00b7 taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards.\n\u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nBecause we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. While we are not currently delaying the implementation of any relevant accounting standards, in the future we may avail ourselves us this right, and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Because our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock may be considered to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if it does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. Our common stock may be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if it meets one or more of the following conditions: (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange; or (iii) is issued by a company (such as ours) that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than $5 million.\nThe principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations set forth in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to: (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our shares.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.\nBecause certain of our executive officers and directors reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights based on the United States federal securities laws or otherwise against such officers and directors in the United States or to enforce judgments of United States courts against them in Israel.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors reside outside of the United States in Israel. As such, it may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws or otherwise against such persons in the courts of either the United States or Israel, and even if civil judgments are obtained in courts of the United States, to enforce such judgments in Israeli courts.\nOur compliance with complicated U.S. regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure is expensive. Moreover, our ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations is uncertain given our management\u2019s relative inexperience with operating U.S. public companies.\nAs a publicly reporting company, we are faced with expensive and complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards of a U.S. public company are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nMoreover, our executive officers have little experience in operating a U.S. public company, which makes our ability to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations uncertain. Our failure to company with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price.\nThere may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm our company.\nProper systems of internal controls over financial accounting and disclosure are critical to the operation of a public company. As we are a start-up company, we are at the very early stages of establishing, and we may be unable to effectively establish such systems, especially in light of the fact that we expect to operate as a publicly reporting company. This would leave us without the ability to reliably assimilate and compile financial information about our company and significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud, all of which would have a negative impact on our company from many perspectives. Moreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, even if established, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.\nWe may be unable to complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by our management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. This assessment requires disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years unless the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time in which case we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 30. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future. Any of the foregoing occurrences, should they come to pass, could negatively impact the public perception of our company, which could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7 provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u00b7 provide that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by our Chairman and/or President, our Board of Directors or a super-majority (66 2/3%) of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 place restrictive requirements (including advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals) on how special meetings of stockholders may be called by our stockholders;\n\u00b7 do not provide stockholders with the ability to cumulate their votes; and\n\u00b7 provide that only a super-majority of our stockholders (66 2/3%) may amend our bylaws.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nUpon dissolution of our company, you may not recoup all or any portion of your investment.\nIn the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the proceeds and/or assets of our company remaining after giving effect to such transaction, and the payment of all of our debts and liabilities will be distributed to the stockholders of common stock on a pro rata basis. There can be no assurance that we will have available assets to pay to the holders of common stock, or any amounts, upon such a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company. In this event, you could lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 15961, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "DRIO"}
