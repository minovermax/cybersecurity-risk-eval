Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the information in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Involving Our Business\nThe development of oil and natural gas properties involves substantial risks that may result in a total loss of investment.\nThe business of exploring for and developing natural gas and oil properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk, and thus a significant risk of loss of initial investment that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. The cost and timing of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. Factors which can delay or prevent drilling or production, or otherwise impact expected results, include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u25cf inability to obtain required permits from governmental authorities;\n\u25cf inability to obtain, or limitations on, easements from landowners;\n\u25cf uncertainty regarding our operating partners\u2019 drilling schedules;\n\u25cf high pressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u25cf equipment failures;\n\u25cf title problems;\n\u25cf fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pollution, spills and other environmental risks or accidents;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations and issuance of local drilling restrictions or moratoria;\n\u25cf adverse weather;\n\u25cf reductions in commodity prices;\n\u25cf pipeline ruptures; and\n\u25cf unavailability or high cost of equipment, field services and labor.\nA productive well may become uneconomic in the event unusual quantities of water or other non-commercial substances are encountered in the well bore that impair or prevent production. We may participate in wells that are or become unproductive or, though productive, do not produce in economic quantities. In addition, even commercial wells can produce less, or have higher costs, than we projected.\nIn addition, initial 24-hour or other limited-duration production rates announced regarding our oil and natural gas properties are not necessarily indicative of future production rates.\nDry holes and other unsuccessful or uneconomic exploration, exploitation and development activities can adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition, and can adversely affect our reserves. We do not currently operate any of our properties, and therefore have limited ability to control the manner in which drilling and other exploration and development activities on our properties are conducted, which may increase these risks.\nOur business has been and may continue to be impacted by adverse commodity prices.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2019, oil prices have ranged from highs over $77 per barrel in 2018 to lows below $43 per barrel in 2017. Global markets, in reaction to general economic conditions and perceived impacts of future global supply, have caused large fluctuations in price, and we believe significant future price swings are likely. Natural gas prices and NGL prices have experienced volatility of comparable magnitude over the same time period. Volatility in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production have and may continue to adversely affect many aspects of our business, including our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, reserves, rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties, all of which depend primarily or in part upon those prices. The reduction in drilling activity will likely result in lower production and, together with lower realized oil prices, lower revenue and adjusted EBITDAX. Declines in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas can also adversely affect our ability to finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, raise capital and satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, declines in prices can reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and the estimated future cash flow from that production and, as a result, adversely affect the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Among other things, a reduction in the amount or present value of our reserves can limit the capital available to us, and the availability of other sources of capital likely will be based to a significant degree on the estimated quantity and value of the reserves.\nDeclines in oil and natural gas prices have and will materially adversely affect our revenues.\nOur financial condition and results of operations depend in large part upon the prices obtainable for our oil and natural gas production and the costs of finding, acquiring, developing and producing reserves. As seen in recent years, prices for oil and natural gas are subject to extreme fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond tour control. These factors include worldwide political instability (especially in the Middle East and other oil producing regions), the foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of drilling activity, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels, speculating activities in the commodities markets, and the overall economic environment. Our operations are substantially adversely impacted as oil prices decline. Lower prices dramatically affect our revenues. Further, drilling of new wells, development of our leases and acquisitions of new properties are also adversely affected and limited. As a result, our potential revenues as well as our proved reserves may substantially decrease from levels achieved during the period when oil prices were much higher. There can be no assurances as to the future prices of oil or natural gas. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, quantities of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced, and access to capital. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been and are likely to continue to be volatile.\nThis volatility makes it difficult to estimate with precision the value of producing properties in acquisitions and to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving our oil and gas properties. In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and natural gas properties, as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties.\nThe Williston Basin (Bakken and Three Forks shales) oil price differential could have adverse impacts on our revenue.\nGenerally, crude oil produced from the Bakken formation in North Dakota is high quality (36 to 44 degrees API, which is comparable to West Texas Intermediate Crude (\u201cWTI\u201d)). During 2019, our weighted average realized oil price in the Williston Basin was $51.92, which due to transportation costs was approximately $5.06 per barrel less than the average WTI spot price for crude oil. This discount, or differential, may widen in the future, which would reduce the price we receive for our production. We may also be adversely affected by widening differentials in other areas of operation.\nDrilling and completion costs for the wells we drill in the Williston Basin are comparable to or higher than other areas where there is no price differential. This makes it more likely that a downturn in oil prices will result in a ceiling limitation write-down of our oil and natural gas properties. A widening of the differential would reduce the cash flow from our Williston Basin properties and adversely impact our ability to participate fully in drilling. Our production in other areas could also be affected by adverse changes in differentials. In addition, changes in differentials could make it more difficult for us to effectively hedge our exposure to changes in commodity prices.\nOur former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors received expense reimbursements without adequate backup, and we paid certain vehicle expenses on behalf of an entity affiliated with John Hoffman, a former director, both of which may be deemed violations of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and/or other federal securities laws.\nOur internal control testing identified inadequate supporting documentation and lack of adequate review for certain travel advances and expense reimbursements.\nFollowing the termination of David Veltri, our former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman, our Audit Committee conducted a review of Company procedures, policies and practices, including travel expense advancements and reimbursements. Our Audit Committee retained independent counsel and an advisory firm with forensic accounting expertise to assist the Audit Committee in conducting the investigation. As part of the investigation, the Audit Committee reviewed our financial policies and procedures, including management expenses. The Audit Committee concluded that Mr. Veltri did not produce receipts with adequate detail for a portion of his reimbursed business expenses he received from 2017 to 2019.\nIn 2018 and 2019, we paid approximately $2,350 for vehicle expenses on behalf of an entity affiliated with Mr. Hoffman. While we were reimbursed for these expenses, it is possible that these payments by the Company on behalf of Mr. Hoffman could be deemed to be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nSection 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits personal loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. If the SEC were to commence an investigation or institute proceedings to enforce a violation of this statute or other federal securities laws as a result of the reimbursement of expenses to Mr. Veltri or the payment of the vehicle expenses associated with an entity owned by an affiliated entity of Mr. Hoffman, we may become a party to litigation or proceedings over these matters, and the outcome of such litigation or proceedings (including criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or penalties by the SEC), alone or in addition to the costs of litigation, may materially and adversely affect our business. We are unable to predict the extent of our ultimate liability with respect to these payments.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective during 2017, 2018 and 2019. We cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies do not exist or that they will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on the results of management\u2019s assessment and evaluation of our internal controls, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019 due to the material weakness described below.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have identified the following material weaknesses:\n\u25cf We had inadequate segregation of duties as a result of limited accounting staff and resources, which has impacted our ability to prevent or detect material errors in our consolidated financial statements and to properly implement new accounting standards.\n\u25cf We had inadequate controls over physical and logical access to our information technology systems.\nAs a result, our management also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.as of December 31, 2019 such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in the reports we file with the SEC (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures\nIf we do not successfully remediate the material weaknesses described above, or if other material weaknesses or other deficiencies arise in the future, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis or prevent fraud, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and require restatement which could result in the loss of investor confidence, delisting or cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls, even once all material weaknesses and control deficiencies are remediated, will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may and not be detected.\nPending litigation and other actions that may be threatened or taken against us could severely limit our liquidity.\nWe are currently involved in litigation with APEG II against us and our former Chief Executive Officer, as described in Item 1. Business-Litigation and Liquidity-APEG II Litigation. As of March 20, 2020, APEG II holds approximately 41% of our outstanding common stock and was our secured lender prior to the maturity on July 30, 2019 of our credit facility with APEG II. The costs associated with the pending litigation and other claims pending or threatened against us have been a significant use of our existing cash, and we have expended over $1.3 million in legal fees to date with respect to the pending actions. While we have historically funded all litigation costs out of operating cash flow, continued excessive legal fees associated with litigation could impair our liquidity profile and ability to fund significant drilling operations and participate in potential acquisitions in the future.\nNon-consent provisions could result in penalties and loss of revenues from wells.\nOur industry partners may elect to engage in drilling activities that we are unwilling or unable to participate in during 2020 and thereafter. Our exploration and development agreements contain customary industry non-consent provisions. Pursuant to these provisions, if a well is proposed to be drilled or completed but a working interest owner elects not to participate, the resulting revenues (which otherwise would go to the non-participant) flow to the participants until the participating parties receive from 150% to 300% of the capital they provided to cover the non-participant\u2019s share. In order to be in position to avoid non-consent penalties and to make opportunistic investments in new assets, we will continue to evaluate various options to obtain additional capital, including debt financing, sales of one or more producing or non-producing oil and natural gas assets and the issuance of shares of our common stock.\nUnanticipated costs could require new capital that may not be available.\nThe oil and natural gas business holds the opportunity for significant returns on investment, but achievement of such returns is subject to high risk. For example, initial results from one or more of the oil and natural gas programs could be marginal but warrant investing in more wells. Dry holes, over-budget exploration costs, low commodity prices, or any combination of these or other adverse factors, could result in production revenues falling below projections, thus adversely impacting cash expected to be available for a continued work program, and a reduction in cash available for investment in other programs. These types of events could require a reassessment of priorities and therefore potential re-allocations of existing capital and could also mandate obtaining new capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any financing transaction on acceptable terms.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and realized built in losses to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and realized built in losses (\u201cRBILS\u201d) to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nOn December 27, 2017, we paid down debt under our credit facility with APEG II with shares of our common stock, which represented a 49.3% ownership change in the Company. As a result, our ability to use these NOLs and RBILS were significantly reduced in 2018 and 2019.\nCompetition may limit our opportunities in the oil and natural gas business.\nThe oil and natural gas business is very competitive. We compete with many public and private exploration and development companies in finding investment opportunities. We also compete with oil and natural gas operators in acquiring acreage positions. Our principal competitors are small to mid-size companies with in-house petroleum exploration and drilling expertise. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. They also may be willing and able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties than our financial resources permit, and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties. In addition, there is substantial competition in the oil and natural gas industry for investment capital, and we may not be able to compete successfully in raising additional capital if needed.\nSuccessful exploitation of the Buda formation, the Williston Basin (Bakken and Three Forks shales) and the Eagle Ford shale is subject to risks related to horizontal drilling and completion techniques.\nOperations in the Buda formation and the Bakken, Three Forks and Eagle Ford shales in many cases involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques in an effort to generate the highest possible cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks that are encountered while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing the well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the zone while drilling horizontally through the shale formation, running casing the entire length of the well bore (as applicable to the formation) and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore.\nFor wells that are hydraulically fractured, completion risks include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of fracture stimulation stages, and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. Ultimately, the success of these latest drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficient period of time.\nCosts for any individual well will vary due to a variety of factors. These wells are significantly more expensive than a typical onshore shallow conventional well. Accordingly, unsuccessful exploration or development activity affecting even a small number of wells could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Costs other than drilling and completion costs can also be significant for Williston Basin, Eagle Ford and other wells.\nIf our access to oil and natural gas markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production and revenues. Securing access to takeaway capacity may be particularly difficult in less developed areas of the Williston Basin.\nMarket conditions or limited availability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and other midstream facilities. The ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, rail transportation and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. In particular, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline or rail takeaway capacity is limited in the Williston Basin. In order to secure takeaway capacity and related services, we or our operating partners may be forced to enter into arrangements that are not as favorable to operators as those in other areas.\nIf we are unable to replace reserves, we will not be able to sustain production.\nOur future operations depend on our ability to find, develop, and acquire crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves that are economically producible. Our properties produce crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs at a declining rate over time. In order to maintain current production rates, we must locate and develop or acquire new crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Without successful drilling or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline over time. In addition, competition for crude oil and natural gas properties is intense, and many of our competitors have financial, technical, human, and other resources necessary to evaluate and integrate acquisitions that are substantially greater than those available to us.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to make acquisitions. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, and acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do. In the event we do complete an acquisition, its successful impact on our business will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the purchase price for the acquisition, future crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves, future operating and capital costs, results of future exploration, exploitation, and development activities on the acquired properties, and future abandonment and possible future environmental or other liabilities. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, actual future production rates, and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets. Actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. A customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties, our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems could result.\nIntegrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks. These risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. Any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on our operating results and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling test write-downs.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas investments. Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop these properties. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized cost of oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a \u201cceiling limit\u201d that is based upon the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of the cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If net capitalized costs exceed the ceiling limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings (a charge referred to as a \u201cceiling test write-down\u201d). The risk of a ceiling test write-down increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed, if we have substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves or if we drill unproductive wells.\nUnder the full cost method, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in a country-wide cost center. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities, but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost, except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit-of-production method, based on proved oil and natural gas reserves. Excluded from amounts subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization are costs associated with unevaluated properties.\nUnder the full cost method, net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of (a) unamortized cost reduced by the related net deferred tax liability and asset retirement obligations, and (b) the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (i) estimated future net revenue, discounted at 10% per annum, from proved reserves, based on unescalated costs, adjusted for contract provisions, any financial derivatives qualifying as accounting hedges and asset retirement obligations, and unescalated oil and natural gas prices during the period, (ii) the cost of properties not being amortized, and (iii) the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized, less (iv) income tax effects related to tax assets directly attributable to the natural gas and crude oil properties. If the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations exceeds the cost center ceiling limitation, a non-cash impairment charge is required in the period in which the impairment occurs.\nWe perform a quarterly ceiling test for our only oil and natural gas cost center, which is the United States. During 2019 and 2018, our capitalized costs for oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the ceiling and, therefore, we did not record an aggregate ceiling test write-down. The ceiling test incorporates assumptions regarding pricing and discount rates over which we have no influence in the determination of present value. In arriving at the ceiling test for the year ended December 31, 2019, we used an average price applicable to our properties of $55.69 per barrel for oil and $2.58 per Mcfe for natural gas, based on average prices per barrel of oil and per Mcfe of natural gas at the first day of each month of the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, to compute the future cash flows of each of the producing properties at that date.\nAs of March 20, 2020, the WTI spot price for crude oil was $23.64 and the 12-month strip price was $28.44. To determine the extent of these price reductions on the realizability of the Company\u2019s oil and gas properties, the Company reran the year end reserves using 50% of the average crude price used in the original ceiling test calculation, or $27.85, as further adjusted for differentials, and determined that by using that price the Company would have incurred a ceiling test write-down of approximately $1.7 million.\nCapitalized costs associated with unevaluated properties include exploratory wells in progress, costs for seismic analysis of exploratory drilling locations, and leasehold costs related to unproved properties. Unevaluated properties not subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization amounted to an aggregate of approximately $3.7 million as of December 31, 2019. These costs will be transferred to evaluated properties to the extent that we subsequently determine the properties are impaired or if proved reserves are established.\nWe do not serve as the operator for most of our oil and natural gas properties. Many of our joint operating agreements contain provisions that may be subject to legal interpretation, including allocation of non-consent interests, complex payout calculations that impact the timing of reversionary interests, and the impact of joint interest audits.\nSubstantially all of our oil and natural gas interests are subject to joint operating and similar agreements. Some of these agreements include payment provisions that are complex and subject to different interpretations and/or can be erroneously applied in particular situations.\nJoint interest audits are a normal process in our business to ensure that operators adhere to standard industry practices in the billing of costs and expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties. However, the ultimate resolution of joint interest audits can extend over a long period of time in which we attempt to recover excessive amounts charged by the operator. Joint interest audits result in incremental costs for the audit services and we can incur substantial amounts of legal fees to resolve disputes with the operators of our properties.\nWe do not operate most of our drilling locations. Therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of these non-operated assets.\nWe do not currently operate any of the prospects we hold with industry partners. As a non-operator, our ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling programs is limited. In the usual case in the oil and natural gas industry, new work is proposed by the operator and often is approved by most of the non-operating parties. If the work is approved by the holders of a majority of the working interests, but we disagree with the proposal and do not (or are unable to) participate, we will forfeit our share of revenues from the well until the participants receive 150% to 300% of their investment. In some cases, we could lose all of our interest in the well. We would avoid a penalty of this kind only if a majority of the working interest owners agree with us and the proposal does not proceed.\nThe success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u25cf the nature and timing of the operator\u2019s drilling and other activities;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of required capital expenditures;\n\u25cf the operator\u2019s geological and engineering expertise and financial resources;\n\u25cf the approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u25cf the operator\u2019s selection of suitable technology.\nThe fact that our industry partners serve as operator makes it more difficult for us to predict future production, cash flows and liquidity needs. Our ability to grow our production and reserves depends on decisions by our partners to drill wells in which we have an interest, and they may elect to reduce or suspend the drilling of those wells.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the relevant underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantity and present value of our reserves.\nOil and natural gas reserve reports are prepared by independent consultants to provide estimates of the quantities of hydrocarbons that can be economically recovered from proved properties, utilizing commodity prices for a trailing 12-month period and taking into account expected capital, operating and other expenditures. These reports also provide estimates of the future net present value of the reserves, which we use for internal planning purposes and for testing the carrying value of the properties on our balance sheet.\nThe reserve data included in this report represent estimates only. Estimating quantities of, and future cash flows from, proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process and not an exact science. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various estimates, including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors, such as future production costs; ad valorem, severance and excise taxes; availability of capital; estimates of required capital expenditures, workover and remedial costs; and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. The assumptions underlying our estimates of our proved reserves could prove to be inaccurate, and any significant inaccuracy could materially affect, among other things, future estimates of the reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to the properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of our future net cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2019, all of our estimated proved reserves were producing. Estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves is almost always based on analogy to existing wells, volumetric analysis or probabilistic methods, in contrast to the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations.\nYou should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The timing and success of the production and the expenses related to the development of oil and natural gas properties, each of which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, will affect the timing and amount of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In addition, our PV-10 and standardized measure estimates are based on costs as of the date of the estimates and assume fixed commodity prices. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the estimate.\nFurther, the use of a 10% discount factor to calculate PV-10 and standardized measure values may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.\nThe use of derivative arrangements in oil and natural gas production could result in financial losses or reduce income.\nFrom time to time, we use derivative instruments, typically fixed-rate swaps and costless collars, to manage price risk underlying our oil and natural gas production. The fair value of our derivative instruments is marked to market at the end of each quarter and the resulting unrealized gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments is recognized in current earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative contracts for the relevant period. If the actual amount of production is higher than we estimated, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount of production is lower than the notional amount that is subject to our derivative instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows.\nDerivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u25cf the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations;\n\u25cf there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u25cf the steps we take to monitor our derivative financial instruments do not detect and prevent transactions that are inconsistent with our risk management strategies.\nIn addition, depending on the type of derivative arrangements we enter into, the agreements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in oil prices. It cannot be assumed that the hedging transactions we have entered into, or will enter into, will adequately protect us from fluctuations in commodity prices.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) provides for statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including crude oil and natural gas derivative transactions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transaction, as well as requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe CFTC has finalized other regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s provisions regarding trade reporting, margin, clearing and trade execution; however, some regulations remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will adopt final rules. For example, the CFTC has re-proposed regulations setting position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions are expected to be made exempt from these limits. Also, it is possible that under recently adopted margin rules, some registered swap dealers may require us to post initial and variation margins in connection with certain swaps not subject to central clearing.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any additional implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of some commodity derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some commodity derivative contracts, limit our ability to trade some derivatives to hedge risks, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a consequence, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. If the implementing regulations result in lower commodity prices, our revenues could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. In the highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in a substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, the loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of our potential drilling locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The risk that our leases may expire will generally increase when commodity prices fall, as lower prices may cause our operating partners to reduce the number of wells they drill. In addition, on certain portions of our acreage, third-party leases could become immediately effective if our leases expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur producing properties are primarily located in the Williston Basin and South Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in these geographic areas.\nBecause our operations are geographically concentrated in the Williston Basin and South Texas, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionally exposed to the effect of regional events. These include, among others, regulatory issues, natural disasters and fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the region and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and other transportation capacity constraints, available rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies, labor and infrastructure capacity. Any of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development of lease inventory before expiration. In addition, our operations in the Williston Basin may be adversely affected by seasonal weather and lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife, which can intensify competition for services, infrastructure and equipment during months when drilling is possible and may result in periodic shortages. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance may be insufficient to cover future liabilities.\nOur business is currently focused on oil and natural gas exploration and development and we also have potential exposure to general liability and property damage associated with the ownership of other corporate assets. In the past, we relied primarily on the operators of our oil and natural gas properties to obtain and maintain liability insurance for our working interest in our oil and natural gas properties. In some cases, we may continue to rely on those operators\u2019 insurance coverage policies depending on the coverage. Since 2011 we have obtained our own insurance policies for our oil and natural gas operations that are broader in scope and coverage and are in our control. We also maintain insurance policies for liabilities associated with and damage to general corporate assets.\nWe also have separate policies for environmental exposures related to our prior ownership of the water treatment plant operations related to our discontinued mining operations. These policies provide coverage for remediation events adversely impacting the environment. See \u201cInsurance\u201d in \u201cItem 1 - Business\u201d.\nWe would be liable for claims in excess of coverage and for any deductible provided for in the relevant policy. If uncovered liabilities are substantial, payment could adversely impact the Company\u2019s cash on hand, resulting in possible curtailment of operations. Moreover, some liabilities are not insurable at a reasonable cost or at all.\nOil and natural gas operations are subject to environmental, legislative and regulatory initiatives that can materially adversely affect the timing and cost of operations and the demand for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety, the environment and natural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the handling or disposal of wastes and other substances associated with operations;\n\u25cf limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas that contain endangered or threatened species and/or species of special statewide concern or their habitats;\n\u25cf requiring investigatory and remedial actions to address pollution caused by our operations or attributable to former operations;\n\u25cf requiring noise, lighting, visual impact, odor and/or dust mitigation, setbacks, landscaping, fencing, and other measures;\n\u25cf restricting access to certain equipment or areas to a limited set of employees or contractors who have proper certification or permits to conduct work (e.g., confined space entry and process safety maintenance requirements); and\n\u25cf restricting or even prohibiting water use based upon availability, impacts or other factors.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial or restoration obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, local restrictions, such as state or local moratoria, city ordinances, zoning laws and traffic regulations, may restrict or prohibit the execution of operational plans. In addition, third parties, such as neighboring landowners, may file claims alleging property damage, nuisance or personal injury arising from our operations or from the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.\nThe trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. We monitor developments at the federal, state and local levels to keep informed of actions pertaining to future regulatory requirements that might be imposed in order to mitigate the costs of compliance with any such requirements. We also monitor industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations and that share best practices and lessons learned in relation to pollution prevention and incident investigations.\nSee \u201cEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\u201d in Item 1 - Business in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the major environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that relate to our business. We believe, but cannot be certain, that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. We cannot reasonably predict what applicable laws, regulations or guidance may eventually be adopted with respect to our operations or the ultimate cost to comply with such requirements.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nPermitting requirements could delay our ability to start or continue our operations.\nOil and natural gas projects are subject to extensive permitting requirements. Failure to timely obtain required permits to start operations at a project could cause delay and/or the failure of the project resulting in a potential write-off of the investments made.\nOur ability to produce crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations and/or completions or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process on which we and others in our industry depend to complete wells that will produce commercial quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs requires the use and disposal or recycling of significant quantities of water. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of, or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of wastes, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage, and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions, or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nSeasonal weather conditions adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in the Williston Basin and the Gulf Coast can be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. In the Williston Basin, drilling and other oil and natural gas activities sometimes cannot be conducted as effectively during the winter months, and this can materially increase our operating and capital costs. Gulf Coast operations are also subject to the risk of adverse weather events, including hurricanes.\nShortages of equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices and activity levels in new regions, causing periodic shortages. These problems can be particularly severe in certain regions such as the Williston Basin and Texas. During periods of high oil and natural gas prices, the demand for drilling rigs and equipment tends to increase along with increased activity levels, and this may result in shortages of equipment. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand for equipment and services and subsequently often result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, oilfield equipment and services, and personnel in exploration, production and midstream operations. These types of shortages and subsequent price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill those wells and conduct those activities that we currently have planned and budgeted, causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nOur management team has experience in dealing with the acquisition and financing of oil and natural gas properties. We rely extensively on third-party consultants for legal, engineering, geophysical and geological advice in oil and natural gas matters. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business, as finding replacements could be difficult as a result of competition for experienced personnel.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nWe have issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock with rights superior to those of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. Shares of preferred stock may be issued with such dividend, liquidation, voting and conversion features as may be determined by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval. Pursuant to this authority, in February 2016 we approved the designation of 50,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred\u201d) in connection with the disposition of our mining segment.\nThe Series A Preferred accrues dividends at a rate of 12.25% per annum of the Adjusted Liquidation Preference. Such dividends are not payable in cash but are accrued and compounded quarterly in arrears. The \u201cAdjusted Liquidation Preference\u201d is initially $40 per share of Series A Preferred for an aggregate of $2.0 million, with increases each quarter by the accrued quarterly dividend. The Series A Preferred is senior to other classes or series of shares of the Company with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation. No dividend or distribution will be declared or paid on our common stock, (i) unless approved by the holders of Series A Preferred and (ii) unless and until a like dividend has been declared and paid on the Series A Preferred on an as-converted basis.\nAt the option of the holder, each share of Series A Preferred may initially be converted into 1.33 shares of our common stock (the \u201cConversion Rate\u201d) for an aggregate of 66,667 shares. This Conversion Rate reflects the effect of the reverse stock split described in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d). The Conversion Rate is subject to anti-dilution adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and certain reorganization events and to price-based anti-dilution protections. Each share of Series A Preferred will be convertible into a number of shares of common stock equal to the ratio of the initial conversion value to the conversion value as adjusted for accumulated dividends multiplied by the Conversion Rate. In no event will the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion be greater than 79,334 shares after taking into account the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. The Series A Preferred will generally not vote with our common stock on an as-converted basis on matters put before our shareholders. The holders of the Series A Preferred have the right to require us to repurchase the Series A Preferred in connection with a change of control. The dividend, liquidation and other rights provided to holders of the Series A Preferred will make it more difficult for holders of common stock to realize value from their investment.\nOne of our existing shareholders beneficially owns a significant portion of our common stock, and its interests may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nAs of March 20, 2020, APEG II beneficially owns 581,927 shares (as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split), or approximately 41%, of our outstanding common stock. As a result, APEG II is able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our charter and bylaws, the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. The interests of APEG II with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities, may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. See \u201cPending litigation and other actions that may be threatened or taken against us could severely limited our liquidity\u201d in this Item1A. Risk Factors and the discussion of this litigation in Item 1. Business-Litigation and Liquidity-APEG II Litigation.\nFuture equity transactions and exercises of outstanding options or warrants could result in dilution.\nFrom time to time, we have sold common stock, warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt to investors in private placements and public offerings. Recently, we privately issued 59,498 shares of our common stock in the New Horizon Acquisition. These transactions caused dilution to existing shareholders. Also, from time to time, we issue options and warrants to employees, directors and third parties as incentives, with exercise prices equal to the market price at the date of issuance. Vesting of restricted common stock and exercise of options and warrants would result in dilution to existing shareholders. Future issuances of equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, would also have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. In addition, the perception that such issuances may occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Under the terms of our Series A Preferred, we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock without the approval of the holders of the Series A Preferred. Accordingly, our common shareholders must look solely to increases in the price of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment, and this may not occur.\nWe could implement take-over defense mechanisms that could discourage some advantageous transactions.\nAlthough our shareholder rights plan expired in 2011, certain provisions of our governing documents and applicable law could have anti-takeover effects. For example, we are subject to a number of provisions of the Wyoming Management Stability Act, an anti-takeover statute, and have a classified or \u201cstaggered\u201d board. We could implement additional anti-takeover defenses in the future. These existing or future defenses could prevent or discourage a potential transaction in which shareholders would receive a takeover price in excess of then-current market values, even if a majority of the shareholders support such a transaction.\nOur stock price likely will continue to be volatile.\nOur stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. During the two years ended December 31, 2019, our common stock has traded as high as $17.60 per share and as low as $3.00 per share, as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split. We expect our common stock will continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf price volatility in the oil and natural gas commodities markets;\n\u25cf variations in our drilling, recompletion and operating activity;\n\u25cf relatively small amounts of our common stock trading on any given day;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf legislative and regulatory changes; and\n\u25cf changes in the national and global economic outlook.\nThe stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and oil and natural gas prices have declined significantly. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of securities of oil and natural gas companies like ours.\nWe effected a reverse stock split which may adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nEffective January 6, 2020, we completed a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock at a ratio of one-for-ten shares (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d). The effect of the Reverse Stock Split upon the future market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, it is possible that the market price of our common stock could decline more than would occur in the absence of the Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Reverse Stock Split may decrease the liquidity of the shares of our common stock and the resulting market price of our common stock may not attract or satisfy the investing requirements of new investors, including institutional investors.\nThe liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be affected adversely by the Reverse Stock Split given the reduced number of shares outstanding following the Reverse Stock Split. Additionally, the Reverse Stock Split may increase the number of shareholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such shareholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting such sales. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the Reverse stock Split will result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors, and there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of these investors. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, its liquidity and value could be reduced.\nIn order for us to maintain the listing of our shares of common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock must maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 as set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Price Requirement\u201d). If the closing bid price of our common stock is below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, then the closing bid price of our common stock must be $1.00 or more for 10 consecutive trading days during a 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the rule. Previously, we were not in compliance with the Minimum Price Requirement but regained compliance following the Reverse Stock Split. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to remain in compliance with the Minimum Price Requirement in the future or satisfy other continued listing requirements. If our common stock is delisted from trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, it may be eligible for trading over-the-counter, but the delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market could adversely impact the liquidity and value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 79039, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "USEG"}
