Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially affected by a number of factors. Our management regularly monitors the risks inherent in our business, with input and assistance from our Enterprise Risk Management department. In addition to real time monitoring, we periodically conduct a formal enterprise-wide risk assessment to identify factors and circumstances that might present significant risk to the Company. Many of these factors are discussed throughout this report. The risks below, however, are not exhaustive. We operate in a rapidly changing environment. Other risks that we currently believe to be immaterial could become material in the future. We also are subject to legal and regulatory change. New factors can emerge, and it is not possible to predict the outcome of all other factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following discussion details the material factors and uncertainties that we believe could cause Kennametal\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements:\nDownturns in the business cycle could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our business has historically been cyclical and subject to significant impact from economic downturns. Global economic downturn coupled with global financial and credit market disruptions have had a negative impact on our sales and profitability historically. These events could contribute to weak end markets, a sharp drop in demand and higher costs of borrowing and/or diminished credit availability. Although we believe that the long-term prospects for our business remain positive, we are unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength, pace or sustainability of economic recovery and the effects of government intervention.\nOur restructuring efforts may not have the intended effects. We are in the process of implementing multi-year restructuring and other actions to improve our manufacturing costs and operating expenses. However, there is no assurance that these actions, or any others that we have taken or may take, will be sufficient to counter any future economic or industry disruptions. We cannot provide assurance that we will not incur additional restructuring charges or impairment charges, or that we will achieve all of the anticipated benefits from restructuring actions we have taken or plan to take in the future. If we are unable to effectively restructure our operations in the light of evolving market conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur factory modernization and End-to-End initiatives began in fiscal 2017. The purpose of these programs are to invest in our plants, equipments and processes to automate and lower our overall labor cost, and to configure equipment in our plants so that we gain efficiency through an end-to-end process. These capital investments are expected to result in substantial savings from reduced labor, maintenance and supply costs while at the same time improving the quality of our products. We cannot provide assurance that we will achieve all of the anticipated savings from these planned actions. These initiatives are expected to put pressure on cash flows in the near-term. Further, as the business has shown more rapid improvements than initially expected, it is possible that we may not be able to modernize fast enough to keep up with demand in select locations, causing us to keep direct hourly employment in certain circumstances somewhat higher than previously anticipated. If we are unable to effectively execute our plans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings. We have manufacturing operations and assets located outside of the U.S., including but not limited to those in Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel and South Africa. We also sell our products to customers and distributors located outside of the U.S. During the year ended June 30, 2017, 56 percent of our consolidated sales were derived from non-U.S. markets. These international operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks of our domestic business, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulations, labor unrest, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments (including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the importation and exportation of products and raw materials), risk of failure of our foreign employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust laws, trade regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, political instability and unrest and risks of increases in taxes. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. To the extent we are unable to effectively manage our international operations and these risks, our international sales may be adversely affected, we may be subject to additional and unanticipated costs, and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory action. As a consequence, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nChanges in the regulatory environment, including environmental, health and safety regulations, could subject us to increased compliance and manufacturing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHealth and Safety Regulations. Certain of our products contain hard metals, including tungsten and cobalt. Hard metal dust is being studied for potential adverse health effects by organizations in several regions throughout the world, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Future studies on the health effects of hard metals may result in our products being classified as hazardous to human health, which could lead to new regulations in countries in which we operate that may restrict or prohibit the use of, and/or exposure to, hard metal dust. New regulation of hard metals could require us to change our operations, and these changes could affect the quality of our products and materially increase our costs.\nEnvironmental Regulations. We are subject to various environmental laws, and any violation of, or our liabilities under, these laws could adversely affect us. Our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under these laws. We may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. If more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations affecting the mining and drilling industries or utilities industry. Some of our principal customers are mining and drilling and utility companies. Many of these customers supply coal, oil, gas or other fuels as a source for the production of utilities in the U.S. and other industrialized regions. The operations of these mining and drilling companies are geographically diverse and are subject to or affected by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate, such as applicable environmental laws and regulations governing the operations of utilities. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to such industries, our customers\u2019 operations could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. The high cost of compliance with mining, drilling and environmental regulations may also induce customers to discontinue or limit their operations, and may discourage companies from developing new opportunities. As a result of these factors, demand for our mining- and drilling-related products could be substantially affected by regulations adversely impacting the mining and drilling industries or altering the consumption patterns of utilities.\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives could result in a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. At June 30, 2017, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $318.7 million, or 13% of our total assets. Goodwill results from acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements and trade secret laws and, to a lesser extent, trademark and patent laws, to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. If one of our patents is infringed upon by a third party, we may need to devote significant time and financial resources to attempt to halt the infringement. We may not be successful in defending the patents involved in such a dispute. Similarly, while we do not knowingly infringe on patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties, we may be required to spend a significant amount of time and financial resources to resolve any infringement claims against us. We may not be successful in defending our position or negotiating an alternative remedy. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce or defend our intellectual property rights in proceedings initiated by or against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure of, or a breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. Any disruption of this infrastructure could negatively impact our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate.\nA security breach of our information technology could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. In addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees or other parties is misappropriated from our computer system. Despite the implementation of security measures, these systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors or similar disruptive problems.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures. We compete directly and indirectly with other manufacturers and suppliers of metalworking tools, engineered components and advanced materials. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater access to financial resources or be less leveraged than us. In addition, the industry in which our products are used is a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive.\nIf we are unable to retain our qualified management and employees, our business may be negatively affected. Our ability to provide high quality products and services depends in part on our ability to retain our skilled personnel in the areas of management, product engineering, servicing and sales. Competition for such personnel is intense, and our competitors can be expected to attempt to hire our management and skilled employees from time to time. In addition, our restructuring activities and strategies for growth have placed, and are expected to continue to place, increased demands on our management\u2019s skills and resources. Additionally, we have not yet completed the headcount reduction initiative associated with our restructuring programs. If we are unable to retain our management team and professional personnel, our customer relationships and level of technical expertise could be negatively affected, which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nAny interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to our restructuring initiatives, unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our business.\nOur future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the prices and availability of raw materials. The raw materials we use for our products include ore concentrates, compounds and secondary materials containing tungsten, tantalum, titanium, niobium and cobalt. A significant portion of our raw materials is supplied by sources outside of the U.S. The raw materials industry as a whole is highly cyclical and at times pricing and supply can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including natural disasters, general economic and political conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rate fluctuations. This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs. In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions can affect how much of the price increases in raw materials that we can recover in the form of higher sales prices for our products. To the extent we are unable to pass on any raw material price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, restrictions in the supply of tungsten, cobalt and other raw materials could adversely affect our operating results. If the prices for our raw materials increase or we are unable to secure adequate supplies of raw materials on favorable terms, our profitability could be impaired. If the prices for our raw materials decrease, we could face product pricing challenges.\nProduct liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business. The sale of metalworking, mining, highway construction and other tools and related products as well as engineered components and advanced materials entails an inherent risk of product liability claims. We cannot give assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate or that our policies will cover any particular loss. Insurance can be expensive, and we may not always be able to purchase insurance on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in recoveries in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to complete, manage or integrate acquisitions successfully. In the past, we have acquired companies and we may continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business. We can give no assurances, however, that any acquisition opportunities will arise or if they do, that they will be consummated, or that additional financing, if needed, will be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, acquisitions involve inherent risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with our expectations. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from the integration of acquisitions as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all. Our failure to consummate an acquisition or effectively integrate newly acquired operations could prevent us from realizing our expected strategic growth and rate of return on an acquired business and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNatural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect results. Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning, we still may be exposed to interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war, which are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 44134, "SIC": 3540, "TIC": "KMT"}
