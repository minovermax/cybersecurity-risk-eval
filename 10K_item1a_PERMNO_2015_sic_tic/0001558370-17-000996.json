RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, future performance, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized officers on our behalf, constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nThe risks, uncertainties and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include the following:\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by a variety of factors. Deterioration in industry conditions or in broader economic conditions could have material adverse effects on our business and financial results.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly cyclical and may be significantly affected by changes in general economic and business conditions, such as:\n\u00b7\nemployment and income levels;\n\u00b7\navailability of financing for homebuyers;\n\u00b7\nshort and long term interest rates;\n\u00b7\nconsumer confidence;\n\u00b7\nlabor availability;\n\u00b7\nlevels of new and existing homes for sale or rent;\n\u00b7\nshifting housing demand due to population and demographic changes; and\n\u00b7\nthe supply of developable land in our markets and the United States generally.\nChanges in these conditions may occur on a national scale, as was largely the case in the most recent downturn, or may acutely affect some of the regions or markets in which we operate more than others. Adverse conditions affecting certain markets could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on other homebuilding companies with smaller presences in these locally affected markets.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions can cause demand and prices for our homes to diminish, cause us to take longer to build our homes, and/or make it more costly for us to do so. We may not be able to recover increased costs by raising prices in the event market conditions are weak and because the price of each home we sell is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as many customers sign their home purchase contracts before construction begins. Adverse economic conditions could also impact our customers\u2019 ability to obtain suitable financing and cause some homebuyers to cancel or refuse to honor their home purchase contracts altogether. Any such adverse change nationally or in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur success depends on the availability of suitable land acquisition opportunities at acceptable prices and our having sufficient liquidity to acquire such properties.\nOur success in developing land and in building and selling homes depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable undeveloped land, partially developed land and improved lots at prices that meet our investment criteria. Such availability depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including competition in local markets for land and lots and restrictive governmental regulations. Should suitable land opportunities become less available, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell would be reduced, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue and profits. In addition, our ability to make land purchases will depend upon us having sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases. We may be at a disadvantage in competing for land due to our debt obligations and restrictive covenants and as a result of our reduced access to capital compared to some of our competitors.\nIf we are unable to develop our communities successfully or within expected timeframes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBefore a community generates any revenues, time and material expenditures are required to acquire land, obtain development approvals and, in many cases, construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. A decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.\nIncreases in interest rates and reductions in the availability of mortgage financing could lower demand for our products, negatively impact our backlog and impact our operating results.\nA substantial majority of our customers finance their homes through lenders that provide mortgage loans. Interest rates have been near historical lows for several years, which has increased the purchasing power of potential homebuyers. Increases in interest rates could lower demand for new homes because monthly mortgage costs would increase for potential homebuyers. Even if potential new homebuyers do not need financing, changes in interest rates could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing. This could prevent or limit our ability to attract new customers as well as our ability to fully realize our backlog because our sales contracts often include financing or other contingencies.\nFollowing the most recent downturn in the housing industry, which began with defaults on subprime loans, lenders, regulators and others questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan products and programs. This resulted in a tightening of lending and qualification standards. Fewer loan products, tighter loan qualifications and a reduced willingness of lenders to make loans, in turn, have made it more difficult for many buyers to sell their homes or to finance the purchase of our homes. A further reduction in loan products or tightening of qualification standards would have a further adverse effect on our results.\nAdditionally, the federal government plays a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, and its insurance of mortgages originated by lenders through the FHA and the VA. The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including consumer interest rates for such loans, could be adversely affected by a curtailment or cessation of the federal government\u2019s mortgage-related programs or policies. The FHA may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs, and/or limit the number of mortgages it insures. Because the availability of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA- and VA-backed mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, any limitations, restrictions or changes in the availability of such government-backed financing could reduce our home sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrice increases, supply shortages and other risks related to demand for building materials could increase our costs and delay deliveries.\nIn recent years the purchase price of building materials, including the price of concrete, lumber, drywall, and other important materials, has increased. Additionally, the homebuilding industry has, from time to time, experienced raw material shortages and been adversely affected by volatility in global commodity prices. Shortages in concrete, lumber, drywall or other important materials could result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of completing, our homes, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are dependent on the availability and skill of subcontractors. If we experience shortages in labor skill or supply, there could be delays and increased costs in developing our communities.\nSubstantially all of our construction work is done by third-party subcontractors with us acting as the general contractor. Accordingly, the timing and quality of our construction depend on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. Access to qualified labor may be affected by circumstances beyond our control, including labor disputes, shortages in qualified trades people and changes in immigration laws and trends in labor force migration. While we generally anticipate being able to obtain sufficient materials and reliable subcontractors, and believe that our relationships with subcontractors are good, the availability of qualified subcontractors in our markets has at times been constrained. We do not have long-term contractual commitments with any subcontractors, and there can be no assurance that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in the areas in which we conduct our operations.\nTo the extent the demand for labor and materials increases as it has in recent years, our average per home cost of labor and building materials will likely increase, and our operating margins and results of operations may be adversely\naffected. Further, the inability to contract with skilled subcontractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nHomebuilding is very competitive, and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We compete with other local, regional and national homebuilders, often within larger subdivisions that are designed, planned and developed by such homebuilders. We also compete with the home re-sale market, foreclosures and rental properties. In addition, many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and sales resources than we do and thus are able to compete more effectively against us. Finally, any damage to our reputation, which may spread widely and quickly through digital and social media, could impair our ability to compete for homebuyers. These competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can affect our business and result in lower sales, lower selling prices and lower profit margin, among other things.\nOur business is capital intensive and requires access to sufficient capital.\nOur business is capital intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land and begin development. We must make significant capital expenditures to commence development of a community and bear the costs of the development until we sell the homes. Accordingly, our ability to access capital is a key factor in our ability to cover our operating expenses, service our indebtedness, and fund our other liquidity needs. We expect to seek and raise additional capital from time to time from a variety of sources, including bank financings and/or securities offerings, to cover our liquidity needs and grow our business. Deterioration in our creditworthiness or a constriction of the capital markets could reduce the sources of liquidity available to us and increase our cost of capital. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could cause project delays and any such delay could result in cost increases and may adversely affect our sales and future results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the total principal amount of our debt was $280.0 million. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations, including the 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 and the 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (collectively, the \u201cNotes\u201d) and our revolving credit facility, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If we are significantly and negatively impacted by any of the foregoing, we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes, as the same shall become due and payable.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. Under such circumstances, we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indentures that govern the Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe terms of the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the Notes restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe indentures governing the Notes contain, and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u00b7\nissue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u00b7\nmake loans and investments;\n\u00b7\nsell assets;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nalter the business we conduct;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indentures governing the Notes or under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our revolving credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u00b7\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u00b7\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operating during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u00b7\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our future financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indentures related to our Notes contain, and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nAdditionally, agreements governing any future indebtedness may contain restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens to support indebtedness, enter into certain affiliate transactions and make certain distributions. These covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, engage in, expand or pursue our business activities and prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.\nWe may be unable to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change.\nWe may not have the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under the 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 following a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d as defined in the indenture governing such notes. Upon the occurrence of a defined fundamental change, which definition includes a change of control (whether it be voluntary or involuntary), we will be required to offer to repurchase all of the applicable outstanding notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. Similarly, our 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 require us to repurchase all or a portion of the outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon certain change of control transactions. However, we may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such event to make the required repurchase of the Notes. Our failure to make or complete an offer to repurchase Notes in connection with any such event would place us in default under each indenture governing the applicable Notes.\nAn inability to obtain additional letters of credit and surety bonds could limit our future growth.\nIn addition, we use letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our performance under various construction and land development agreements, escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other arrangements. Should our future performance or economic conditions continue to make such letters of credit and surety bonds costly or difficult to obtain or lead to us being required to collateralize such instruments to a greater extent than previously, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nCancellations of home sales orders in backlog may increase as homebuyers choose to not honor their contracts.\nOur backlog reflects sales contracts with our homebuyers for homes that have not yet been delivered. In cases of cancellation, we remarket the home and, subject to certain exceptions, usually retain any deposits. Nevertheless, the deposits may not cover the additional costs involved in remarketing the home, replacing installed options, reducing the sales price or increasing incentives on the completed home for greater marketability and carrying higher inventory. If prices for new homes decline, if competitors increase their use of sales incentives, if interest rates increase, if the availability of mortgage financing diminishes or if there is a downturn in local or regional economies or in the national economy, U.S. homebuyers may terminate their existing home purchase contracts with us in order to negotiate for a lower price or because they cannot, or will not, complete the purchase. Any significant increase in cancellations of home sales orders in backlog in the future could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our operations in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenue or decreases in the market value of our land and homes in these regions from factors which may affect any of these regions.\nOur operations are concentrated in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. Due to the concentrated nature of our operations, negative factors affecting one or more of these geographic regions at the same time could result in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of operations.\nInflation or deflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor. We may not be able to offset any such cost increases with higher sales prices. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing demand. In such an environment, we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and we may not be able to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts, which may be well in advance of the construction of the home, which could cause our margins to decrease. Moreover, with inflation, our costs of capital increase, and the purchasing power of our cash resources may decline.\nAlternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance, making it impractical for potential homebuyers to sell their existing homes in favor of a new home.\nElimination or reduction of the tax benefits associated with owning a home could dissuade potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nSignificant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for an individual\u2019s federal, and in some cases, state income taxes, subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws, as has been discussed from time to time, to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers. The resulting loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions, if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions, would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes. In addition, increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or the desire of potential customers to purchase new homes.\nHomebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims and other litigation risks in the ordinary course of business that can be significant. Our operating expenses could increase if we are required to pay higher insurance premiums or incur substantial litigation costs with respect to such claims and risks.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Construction defects may occur on projects and developments and may arise during a significant period of time after completion. Defects arising on a development attributable to us may lead to significant contractual or other liabilities as well as reputational harm. As a consequence, we maintain products and completed operations excess liability insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to damages resulting from faulty workmanship and materials, and create warranty and customer service reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the risks associated with the types of homes built. Although we actively monitor our insurance reserves and coverage, because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future.\nIn addition, decreases in home values as a result of general economic conditions may result in an increase in construction defect claims, as well as claims based on marketing and sales practices. Our reserves may not cover all of the claims arising from such issues, or we may experience litigation costs and losses that could impact our profitability. Even if we are successful in defending such claims, we may incur significant costs.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, and our ability to sell homes, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, and our quarterly operating results can fluctuate.\nOur quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in the winter and spring months, although new order activity is also highly dependent on the number of actively selling communities and the timing of new community openings as well as other market factors. We may experience higher liquidity demands during the first half of the calendar year as we incur the costs associated with new construction resulting from the increased sales volume. If, due to construction delays or other reasons, we are unable to deliver our expected number of homes in the second half of the calendar year, our full year results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by weather conditions and natural disasters.\nWeather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts and floods, can harm our homebuilding business. These can delay home closings, the development of raw land positions, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or damage homes under construction. The climates of certain of the states in which we operate present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters. In particular, a large portion of our homebuilding operations are concentrated in Florida and the Carolinas, which are subject to increased risk of hurricanes. Furthermore, if our insurance does not fully cover losses resulting from these events or any related business interruption, our assets, financial condition and capital resources could be adversely affected.\nResource shortages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe areas in which we operate are subject to resource shortages, including significant changes to the availability of potable and non-potable water. Shortages of natural resources, particularly water, may make it more difficult for us to obtain regulatory approval for new developments or present challenges within existing developments. We may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such shortages continue. Furthermore, these shortages may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate, which may reduce demand for our homes. In addition, the cost of petroleum products, which are used both to deliver our materials and to transport our employees to our job sites, fluctuates and may increase as a result of geopolitical events or accidents. This could also result in higher prices for any product utilizing petrochemicals. These cost increases may have an adverse effect on our operating margin and results of operations.\nValues of, and costs associated with, our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe risks inherent in controlling or purchasing, holding and developing land for new home construction are substantial and increase as consumer demand for housing decreases. The value of undeveloped land, developed lots and\nhousing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions. If the fair market value of the land, lots and inventories we hold decreases, we may be required to reduce the carrying value of these assets and take significant impairment charges. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably. In addition, our deposits for developed lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in poorly performing communities or markets. Because future market conditions are uncertain, we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in managing our future inventory risks or avoiding future impairment charges. Any material write-downs of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some real estate investments are relatively difficult to sell quickly. As a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited, and we may be forced to hold non-income producing assets for an extended period of time. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms that we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.\nAn oversupply of alternatives to new homes and reduction in homebuyer demand can adversely impact our ability to sell new homes.\nAn oversupply of alternatives to new homes, including foreclosed homes, homes held for sale by investors and speculators, other existing homes and rental properties, can adversely impact our ability to sell new homes, depress new home prices and reduce margins on the sales of new homes. High levels of foreclosures not only contribute to additional inventory available for sale, but can also reduce appraisal valuations for new homes, potentially resulting in lower sales prices.\nReduced home sales may impair our ability to recoup development costs or force us to absorb additional costs.\nWe incur many costs before we begin to build homes in a community. Depending on the stage of development a land parcel is in when acquired, such costs may include costs of preparing land; finishing and entitling lots; installing roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities; building amenities in our age-restricted and age-targeted communities; paying taxes and other costs related to ownership of the land on which we plan to build homes; and incurring promotional marketing and overhead expenses to prepare for the opening of a new home community for sales. In addition, local municipalities may impose requirements resulting in additional costs. If the rate at which we sell and deliver homes slows or falls, or if we delay the opening of new home communities for sales due to adjustments in our marketing strategy or other reasons, we may incur additional costs, and it will take a longer period of time for us to recover our costs.\nTPG Aviator, L.P. is a significant stockholder and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future.\nTPG Aviator, L.P. (\u201cTPG Aviator\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 43.5% of our common stock as of December 31, 2016, and is our largest single stockholder. In addition, so long as TPG Aviator owns at least 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock, TPG Aviator has a pre-emptive right to participate in our future equity issuances, subject to certain conditions. This concentration of ownership in one stockholder could potentially be disadvantageous to other stockholders\u2019 interests. In addition, if TPG Aviator were to sell or otherwise transfer all or a large percentage of its holdings, our stock price could decline and we could find it difficult to raise capital, if needed, through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe interests of TPG Aviator and its affiliates may differ from the interests of our other stockholders in material respects. For example, TPG Aviator and its affiliates may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us. TPG Aviator and its affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business. They\nmay also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nOur stockholders agreement with TPG Aviator grants TPG Aviator certain rights that may restrain our ability to take various actions in the future.\nIn connection with TPG Aviator\u2019s June 2013 investment in us, we entered into a stockholders agreement with TPG Aviator, pursuant to which we granted TPG Aviator certain rights that may restrict our ability to take certain actions in the future. Under the stockholders agreement, we agreed to increase the size of our board of directors to ten members and we appointed four directors designated by TPG Aviator.\nTPG Aviator has the right to nominate a specified number of directors to the board and to appoint a specified number of such directors to each committee of the board of directors for so long as TPG Aviator\u2019s ownership percentage of our common stock is equal to or greater than 5%. TPG Aviator is entitled to nominate to the board: (i) four directors if TPG Aviator\u2019s ownership percentage of our common stock is at least 30%, (ii) three directors if TPG Aviator\u2019s ownership percentage is at least 20% but less than 30%, (iii) two directors if TPG Aviator\u2019s ownership percentage is at least 15% but less than 20%, and (iv) one director if TPG Aviator\u2019s ownership percentage is at least 5% but less than 15%.\nIn addition, we agreed to constitute each of our compensation committee and finance committee as a five member committee and (i) for so long as the ownership of TPG Aviator and its affiliates of our common stock is at least 15%, TPG Aviator has the right to have two TPG Aviator designated board members appointed to each such committee (of which all such TPG Aviator designees have been appointed), and (ii) for so long as the ownership of TPG Aviator and its affiliates of our common stock is at least 5% but less than 15%, TPG Aviator has the right to have one TPG Aviator designated board member appointed to each such committee. For so long as the ownership of TPG Aviator and its affiliates of our common stock is at least 5%, each other committee of our board will be constituted as three member committees, and TPG Aviator has the right to have one TPG Aviator designated board member appointed to each such committee (of which all such TPG Aviator designees have been appointed).\nIn addition, for so long as TPG Aviator\u2019s ownership percentage of our common stock is equal to or greater than 5%, the rights and responsibilities of the finance committee of the board will include approval of (1) except for certain permitted issuances relating to outstanding rights to purchase or acquire our capital stock, compensation arrangements and acquisition transactions, any sale or issuance of any capital stock or other security, (2) any redemption, purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of securities by AV Homes or any subsidiary, other than in connection with equity compensation arrangements, (3) any incurrence of indebtedness or certain debt-like obligations, with limited exceptions, (4) any hiring or firing of members of senior management, (5) any land or builder acquisitions or dispositions, any acquisitions or dispositions of subsidiaries or any other acquisitions or dispositions, in each case, that are greater than $5.0 million (including total expected capital requirements and development costs), (6) any capital expenditures or land commitments over an agreed upon budget, as approved by our board of directors, or otherwise greater than $10.0 million, and (7) any entry into new markets or lines of business. During such period, the rights and responsibilities of the compensation committee will include approval of (1) any adoption of any new, or expansion of any existing, equity incentive plan, and (2) any changes to, or the adoption of, any compensation arrangements for any members of our board of directors or senior management. During such period, our board may not approve such matters without the requisite committee approval, which in most cases will require the approval of at least one of the committee members appointed by TPG Aviator.\nPursuant to the terms of the stockholders agreement, TPG Aviator also has the right to consent to certain actions related to our corporate existence and governance, including any change in the rights and responsibilities of either the finance committee or the compensation committee, for so long as TPG Aviator\u2019s ownership percentage of our common stock is equal to or greater than 10% and equal to or greater than 25% of the number of shares owned by them at closing of the TPG Aviator investment.\nWe are dependent on the services of our senior management team and certain of our key employees, and the loss of their services could hurt our business.\nWe believe that our management\u2019s experience is a competitive strength, and that our future success depends upon our ability to retain these executives. In addition, we believe that our ability to attract, train, assimilate and retain new skilled personnel is important to the success of our business. If we are unable to retain our senior management team and certain of our key employees, or attract, train, assimilate or retain other skilled personnel in the future, it could hinder the execution of our business strategy.\nOur current efforts to grow and expand our operations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or profitability.\nIn 2015, we announced the acquisition of Bonterra Builders, LLC, which significantly expanded our operations in the Carolinas, and we continue to consider opportunities for growth, in both our existing markets and in new markets. Additional growth of our business, either through increased land purchases, the development of larger projects or the acquisition of existing homebuilders, may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or profitability. Any expansion of our business into new markets or new businesses, or significant growth in existing markets, could divert the attention of senior management from our existing business and could fail due to our relative lack of experience in those markets or businesses. In addition, when we acquire other homebuilders, such acquisitions could be difficult to integrate with our operations and could require us to assume unanticipated liabilities and expenses. Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including (i) the risk of impairing inventory and other assets related to the acquisition, (ii) risks associated with our ability to implement and maintain effective controls, procedures and policies for the acquired business, (iii) the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other business concerns, (iv) risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience, (v) risks associated with the combination of different corporate cultures, and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company.\nGovernment regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction, including zoning, density restrictions, building design and building standards. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to being approved, if approved at all. Land parcels we acquire are often undeveloped and sometimes do not have all (or sometimes any) of the governmental approvals necessary to develop and construct homes. If we are unable to obtain these approvals or obtain approvals that restrict our ability to use the land in ways we do not anticipate, the value of the parcel will be negatively impacted. We are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water and sewage facilities, roads and other local services. Laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and often result in increased construction or other costs related to our business. In some instances, we must comply with laws that require commitments from us to provide roads and other offsite infrastructure to be in place prior to the commencement of new construction. New housing developments may also be subject to various fees and assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public improvements. Any of these regulatory issues can limit or delay home construction and increase our operating costs.\nWe are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning land use and the protection of health, safety and the environment. The particular impact and requirements of environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site\u2019s environmental conditions and the present and former use of the site. We expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders in the future. Environmental laws may result in delays, cause us to implement time consuming and expensive compliance programs and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials, such as lumber. Furthermore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties and other sanctions and damages from third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of our failure to comply with, or liabilities under, applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nWe have a significant number of development liabilities related to our predecessor and its affiliates, over which we have little or no control as to the dates that payment may be required, and which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have a significant number of development liabilities related to our predecessor and its affiliates, most of which relate to class action settlement agreements entered into by us in 1974 and the bankruptcy of our predecessor and its affiliates in the mid-1970s (collectively, the \u201cOrders\u201d). Among other things, under the Orders, we are obligated to install certain utility infrastructure to lots sold by us in Rio Rico, Arizona and Poinciana, Florida prior to such Orders (\u201cAffected Lots\u201d). Historically, we have identified such contingent obligations with respect to the Orders as evaluated by the reports of various independent engineers. Our estimate of the liability has been accrued and is included in the estimated development liability line item in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. If a significant number of the owners of the Affected Lots require us to install infrastructure in Rio Rico or Poinciana, it is possible that it would have a material impact on our liquidity.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nFrom the end of our 2007 fiscal year through 2014, we generated significant net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d). Under federal tax laws, we can use our NOL (and certain related tax credits) to reduce our future taxable income for up to 20 years, after which they expire for such purposes. Until they expire, we can carry forward the NOL (and certain related tax credits) that we do not use in any particular year to reduce our taxable income in future years. As of December 31, 2016, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, totaling $110.3 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had net deferred tax assets of $124.5 million, which was offset by a valuation allowance of $124.5 million. During 2016, we evaluated both positive and negative evidence and determined it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that our federal deferred tax assets and our state deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, we reversed the full valuation allowance during 2016.\nThe majority of our net deferred tax asset is federal related and is valued at a 35% corporate income tax rate. If, as some lawmakers have proposed, the U.S. corporate income tax rate is lowered, we would be required to write down a roughly proportionate amount of the value of our federal net deferred tax asset to account for this lower rate. The lower tax rate would reduce our future federal taxes, which may put a portion of our tax credits at risk of expiring before we could use them.\nIn addition, the benefits of our NOL, built-in losses and tax credits would be reduced or eliminated if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as determined under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d). A Section 382 ownership change occurs if a stockholder or a group of stockholders who are deemed to own at least 5% of our common stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change were to occur, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of NOL we could use to reduce our taxable income equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (reduced by certain items specified in Section 382) and the federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. A number of complex rules apply in calculating this annual limit.\nChanges in global or regional environmental conditions and governmental actions in response to such changes may adversely affect us by increasing the costs of or restricting our planned or future growth activities.\nThere is growing concern from members of the scientific community and the general public that an increase in global average temperatures due to emissions of greenhouse gases and other human activities have or will cause significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. An increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions and environmental events could limit, delay and/or increase the costs to develop land and build new homes and reduce the value of our land and housing inventory in locations that become less desirable to consumers or blocked to development. Projected climate change, if it occurs, may exacerbate the scarcity of water and other natural resources in affected regions, which could limit, prevent or increase the costs of residential development in certain areas. In addition, government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate\nor reduce greenhouse gas emissions or projected climate change impacts could result in prohibitions or severe restrictions on land development in certain areas, increased energy, transportation and raw material costs that make building materials less available or more expensive, or cause us to incur compliance expenses and other financial obligations to meet permitting or land development or home construction-related requirements that we may be unable to fully recover (due to market conditions or other factors), and may reduce our housing gross profit margins and may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements, potentially to a material degree. As a result, climate change impacts, and laws and land development and home construction standards, and/or the manner in which they are interpreted or implemented, to address potential climate change impacts, could increase our costs and have a long-term adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial statements.\nAs we continue to increase our dependence on digital technologies to conduct operations, our risks associated with cyber security have also increased, leaving us subject to possible frequent and severe cyber incidents.\nFor a number of years, we have been increasing our reliance on computers and digital technology. Many of our files have been digitized and more of our employees are working in almost paperless environments. We have also made changes, some significant, to our hardware and software environments and some of these transitions have not been successful, taken longer than anticipated and/or are still in progress. All of these activities may give rise to material cyber security risks and potential costs and consequences that cannot be estimated or predicted with any certainty. We have outsourced a number of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) functions, including IT support of our infrastructure and software. We continue to take steps to secure, or ensure the security of, our confidential information, including information stored by our vendors and data storage providers, from third parties who may be seeking to infiltrate our systems or those of third-parties with whom we do business. At this time we do not have any specific insurance for cyber security events. Management will continue to monitor our IT environment and determine whether our business operations merit further insurance coverage as we consider a future cyber-attack a material concern that could have severe financial and other business implications.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIssuances of shares of common stock upon conversion of our 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020, as well as the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities either for new consideration or in connection with restructuring existing indebtedness, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Any such future issuances could also dilute the ownership interests of stockholders, and we cannot predict the effect that future issuances of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock, nor can we predict our future needs to fund our operations or balance sheet with future equity issuances.\nWe have significant intangible assets. If these assets become impaired, then our profits and shareholders\u2019 equity may be reduced.\nWe have significant intangible assets related to business combinations. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired, the carrying value is written down to fair value. This would result in a charge to our earnings. If management\u2019s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur.", "PERMNO": 16030, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "AVHI"}
