{"cik": "1062231", "company": "AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered as our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if any of the following risks occur.\nOur business is significantly dependent on sales to GM and FCA.\nWe are the principal supplier of driveline components to GM for its full-size RWD light trucks and SUVs manufactured in North America, supplying substantially all of GM's rear axle and 4WD/AWD axle requirements for these vehicle platforms. Sales to GM were approximately 67% of our consolidated net sales in 2016, 66% in 2015, and 68% in 2014. A reduction in our sales to GM or a reduction by GM of its production of RWD light trucks or SUVs, as a result of market share losses of GM or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also supply driveline system products for FCA's heavy-duty Ram full-size pickup trucks and its derivatives, the AWD Jeep Cherokee and a passenger car driveshaft program. Sales to FCA accounted for approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales in 2016, 20% in 2015 and 18% in 2014. A reduction in our sales to FCA or a reduction by FCA of its production of the programs we support, as a result of market share losses of FCA or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may also be adversely affected by reduced demand for the product programs we currently support, or anticipate supporting in the future, or if we do not obtain sales orders for successor programs that replace our current product programs.\nOur business is dependent on the rear-wheel drive light truck and SUV market segments in North America.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from products supporting RWD light truck and SUV platforms in North America. Sales and production levels of light trucks and SUVs can be affected by many factors, including changes in consumer demand; product mix shifts favoring other types of light vehicles, such as front-wheel drive based crossover vehicles and passenger cars; fuel prices; and government regulation, such as the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) regulations and related emissions standards promulgated by federal and state regulators. The U.S. CAFE standards for cars and light-duty trucks currently require the equivalent of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Our customers are currently planning for these regulations and the potential impact on consumer preferences and demand for vehicles. A reduction in the market segment we currently supply could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are under continuing pressure from our customers to reduce our prices.\nAnnual price reductions are a common practice in the automotive industry. The majority of our products are sold under purchase orders pursuant to long-term contracts with prices scheduled at the time the contracts are established. Many of our contracts require us to reduce our prices in subsequent years and most of our contracts allow us to adjust prices for engineering changes. If we must accommodate a customer's demand for higher annual price reductions and are unable to offset the impact of any such price reductions through continued technology improvements, cost reductions or other productivity initiatives, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business faces substantial competition.\nThe automotive industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include the driveline component manufacturing facilities controlled by OEMs, as well as many other domestic and foreign companies possessing the capability to produce some or all of the products we supply. In addition to traditional competitors in the automotive sector, the trend towards advanced electronic integration has increased the level of new market entrants, including technology companies. Some of our competitors are affiliated with OEMs and others have economic advantages as compared to our business, such as patents, existing underutilized capacity and lower wage and benefit costs. Technology, design, quality, delivery and cost are the primary elements of competition in our industry segment. As a result of these competitive pressures and other industry trends, OEMs and suppliers are developing strategies to reduce costs. These strategies include supply base consolidation and global sourcing. Our business may be adversely affected by increased competition from suppliers benefiting from OEM affiliate relationships or financial and other resources that we do not possess. Our business may also be adversely affected if we do not sustain our ability to meet customer requirements relative to technology, design, quality, delivery and cost.\nIf we are unable to respond timely to changes in regulation, technology, and market innovation, we risk not being able to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are impacted, in part, by our competitive advantage in developing, engineering, and manufacturing innovative products. In the future, our ability to anticipate changes in technology, successfully develop, engineer, and bring to market new and innovative proprietary products will have a significant impact on our market competitiveness. If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage through innovation, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions and joint ventures.\nEngaging in acquisitions and joint ventures involves potential risks, including financial risks and failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions and joint ventures. Integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integrations successfully. On November 3, 2016, AAM entered into a definitive merger agreement with Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. (MPG). Failure to successfully consummate and integrate the MPG acquisition, or to realize the expected benefits and efficiencies of such acquisition, may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs we continue to expand globally and accelerate our diversification efforts, we may pursue strategic growth initiatives with greater frequency. An inability to successfully achieve the levels of organic and inorganic growth from our strategic initiatives could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure of our information technology (IT) networks and systems, or a failure to successfully integrate the IT systems of acquired companies, could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes or activities. Additionally, we and certain of our third-party vendors collect and store personal information in connection with human resources operations and other aspects of our business. The secure operation of these information technology networks and systems and the proper processing and maintenance of this information are critical to our business operations. We cannot be certain that the security measures we have in place to protect these systems and data will be successful or sufficient to protect our IT systems from current and emerging technology threats and damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed or lost. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, the disruption of our operations or damage to our reputation. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nIf the Company is able to consummate its pending acquisition of MPG, there is no assurance we would be able to successfully integrate their IT systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur company's global operations are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nWe have business and technical offices and manufacturing facilities in many foreign countries. Approximately 9,500 of our 13,100 associates are located outside of the U.S. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the U.S., such as changes in currency exchange rates, tax laws, price and currency exchange controls, import restrictions, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action. Our global operations also may be adversely affected by political events and domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities. Current events, including the recent U.S. presidential election, the United Kingdom's vote to exit the European Union, potential changes in immigration policies and tax reform proposals, create a level of uncertainty for multi-national companies. As U.S. companies continue to expand globally, increased complexity exists due to the possibility of renegotiated trade deals, revised international tax law treaties, and changes to the U.S. corporate tax code. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.\nOur business is dependent on our Guanajuato Manufacturing Complex\nA high concentration of our global business is supported by our Guanajuato Manufacturing Complex (GMC) in Mexico. In 2016, GMC represented approximately half of our consolidated net sales, and represented a significant portion of our profitability and cash flow. We expect GMC to continue to represent a substantial portion of these metrics for the foreseeable future. A significant disruption to our GMC operations as a result of changes in trade agreements between Mexico and the U.S., tariffs, natural disaster or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNegative or unexpected tax consequences, as well as possible changes in foreign and domestic tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere have been recent global proposals brought forward by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) alongside the Group of Twenty (G-20), for tax jurisdictions to evaluate reforming longstanding corporate tax law principles and treaties that could adversely affect multi-national companies. The focus is on the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions, a concept known as Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Although the OECD does not enact tax law, proposals like this or others that lead to substantial changes in enacted tax law and treaties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to examinations of these income tax returns by the relevant tax authorities. Based on the status of these audits and the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, it is not possible to estimate the impact of changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Any negative or unexpected outcomes of these examinations and audits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product recall or field action, product liability and warranty claims, litigation and other disputes and claims.\nWe are exposed to warranty, product recall or field action and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected, and we may be required to participate in a recall of such products. We are not responsible for certain warranty claims that may be incurred by our customers, which include returned components for which no trouble was found upon inspection, discretionary acts of dealer goodwill, defects related to certain directed buy components, and build-to-print design issues. We review warranty claim activity in detail, and we may have disagreements with our customers as to responsibility for these types of costs incurred by our customers. In addition, as we continue to diversify our customer base, we expect our obligation to share in the cost of providing warranties as part of our agreements with new customers will increase. Costs and expenses associated with warranties, field actions, product recalls and product liability claims could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and may differ materially from the estimated liabilities that we have recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to warranty claims relating directly to products we produce, potential product recalls for our customers and their other suppliers, and the potential reputational harm that may result from such product recalls, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business. Although we believe that none of these matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such legal proceeding or any future legal proceedings.\nOur business could be adversely affected by disruptions in our supply chain and our customers' supply chain.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and materials needed for our products. We rely upon, and expect to continue to rely upon, certain suppliers for critical components and materials that are not readily available in sufficient volume from other sources. As we continue to expand our global manufacturing footprint, we may need to rely on suppliers in local markets that have not yet proven their ability to meet our requirements. These supply chain characteristics make us susceptible to supply shortages and price increases. If production volumes increase rapidly, there can be no assurance that the suppliers of critical components and materials will be able or willing to meet our future needs on a timely basis.\nOur supply chain as well as our customers' supply chain is also at risk of unanticipated events such as natural disasters or changes in governmental regulations that could cause a disruption in the supply of critical components to us and our customers. A significant disruption in the supply of these materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur company or our customers may not be able to successfully and efficiently manage the timing and costs of new product program launches.\nCertain of our customers are preparing to launch, or have recently launched, new product programs for which we will supply newly developed driveline system products and related components. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the transition of our manufacturing facilities and resources to support these new product programs or other future product programs on a timely and cost efficient basis. Accordingly, the launch of new product programs may adversely affect production rates or other operational efficiency and profitability measures at our facilities. We may also experience difficulties with the performance of our supply chain on program launches, which could result in our inability to meet our contractual obligations to key customers. Production shortfalls or production delays, if any, could result in our failure to effectively manage our material and freight costs relating to these program launches. In addition, our customers may delay the launch or fail to successfully execute the launch of these new product programs, or any additional future product program for which we will supply products. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted if our customers fail to timely launch such programs or if we are unable to manage the timing requirements and costs of new product program launches.\nOur company may not realize all of the revenue expected from our new and incremental business backlog.\nThe realization of incremental revenues from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the accuracy of customer estimates relating to the number of vehicles to be produced in new and existing product programs and the timing of such production, as well as the fluctuation in exchange rates for programs sourced in currencies other than our reporting currency. It is also possible that our customers may delay or cancel a product program that has been awarded to us. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected relative to our current financial plans if we do not realize substantially all the revenue from our new and incremental business backlog.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our company's global results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our normal business operations, including risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our local functional currencies. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in a currency other than the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries are reported in current period income. In the future, unfavorable changes in exchange rate relationships between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and their non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. While we use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to help mitigate certain of these risks and reduce the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates, our efforts to manage these risks may not be successful.\nWe are also subject to currency translation risk as we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. We report the effect of translation for our foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Unfavorable changes in the exchange rate relationship between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by volatility in the price of raw materials.\nWorldwide commodity market conditions in recent years have resulted in volatility in the cost of steel and other metallic materials we use in production. During periods of general economic improvement and increases in customer demands, we have seen the cost of steel and metallic materials needed for our products increase. If we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nThe majority of our hourly associates worldwide are members of industrial trade unions employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements. Substantially all of our hourly associates in the U.S. are represented by the UAW. Approximately 4,800 of our hourly associates at our facilities in Mexico and Brazil are also covered by collective bargaining agreements which expire annually. There can be no assurance that future negotiations with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not experience a work stoppage or disruption that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that such future negotiations will not result in labor cost increases or other terms and conditions that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or our ability to compete for future business.\nWe use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could materially adversely affect our business and our competitive position.\nOur company's ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key associates, such as engineers and global operational leadership. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly engineers and other employees with critical expertise and skills that support key customers and products. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key associates, unexpected turnover, or the failure to attract or retain associates, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets are at risk of impairment if our business or market conditions indicate that the carrying value of those assets exceeds their fair value.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) require that companies evaluate the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets routinely in order to assess whether any indication of asset impairment exists. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be evaluated on an annual basis, while finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets should be evaluated only when events and circumstances exist that indicate an asset or group of assets may be impaired.\nThe pending acquisition of MPG is expected to significantly increase the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and is also expected to result in a change to our current organizational structure from one reporting unit to multiple reporting units. If the acquisition does result in the creation of multiple reporting units, the threshold for analyzing impairment of goodwill will be reduced from an evaluation of the carrying value of our consolidated operations and its related fair value, to an analysis performed at the reporting unit level. This could potentially provide greater risk that goodwill becomes impaired in future operating periods. Further, the expected increase to goodwill and other intangible asset balances, upon acquisition, provides a greater chance that an impairment of these assets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial condition and operations may be adversely affected by a violation of financial and other covenants.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants related to secured and unsecured indebtedness leverage and interest coverage. The revolving credit facility limits our ability to make certain investments, loans and guarantees, declare dividends or distributions on capital stock, redeem or repurchase capital stock and certain debt obligations, incur liens, incur indebtedness, enter into certain restrictive agreements, merge, make acquisitions or sell all or substantially all of our assets. The indenture governing our senior unsecured notes also restricts our ability to incur debt secured by liens, engage in consolidations or mergers or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions. The revolving credit facility also significantly restricts our ability to incur additional secured debt. The revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also include customary events of default. Obligations under the revolving credit facility, the 7.75% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (7.75% Notes), the 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (6.625% Notes), the 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (6.25% Notes) and our 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (5.125% Notes) are required to be guaranteed by most of our U.S. subsidiaries that hold domestic assets. In addition, the revolving credit facility is secured on a first priority basis by all or substantially all of the assets of AAM, Inc., the assets of Holdings and each guarantor's assets, including a pledge of capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries that hold domestic assets, including each guarantor, and a portion of the capital stock of the first tier foreign subsidiaries of AAM. A violation of any of these covenants or agreements could result in a default under these contracts, which could permit the lenders or note holders, as applicable, to accelerate repayment of any borrowings or notes outstanding at that time and levy on the collateral granted in connection with the revolving credit facility. A default or acceleration under the revolving credit facility or the indentures governing the senior unsecured notes may result in increased capital costs and defaults under our other debt agreements and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our subsidiaries' and guarantors' ability to operate their respective businesses and our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur company faces substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\nWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to certain of our associates and retirees. Our ability to satisfy the funding requirements associated with these obligations will depend on our cash flow from operations and our ability to access credit and the capital markets. The funding requirements of these benefit plans, and the related expense reflected in our financial statements, are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility, including governmental regulation. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits, funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on pension assets, mortality rates and the health care cost trend rate. If the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to costs associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our operations and facilities have been and are being operated in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. The operation of our manufacturing facilities entails risks in these areas, however, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or other pertinent requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future by governmental authorities.\nRisks Related to AAM\u2019s Pending Merger with MPG\nWe cannot provide any assurance that the merger will be completed.\nThe completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions described in the merger agreement, including, among others, (i) adoption by MPG stockholders of the merger agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) approval by AAM stockholders of the AAM share issuance, (iii) obtaining antitrust and other regulatory approvals in certain jurisdictions and (iv) the absence of any event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on MPG's or AAM's business.\nAlthough AAM has agreed in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, these and other conditions to the merger may not be satisfied. In addition, satisfying the conditions to the merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, expected. Any delay in completing the merger may adversely affect the benefits that AAM expects to achieve from the merger and the integration of MPG\u2019s business.\nThere can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of the merger, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain restraining orders or injunctions by judgment, court order or law that would prohibit the completion of the merger.\nOur inability to satisfy and comply with conditions under our existing financing arrangements or raise additional or replacement financing could delay or prevent the completion of the merger.\nOur obligations under the merger agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding our ability to finance, or obtain financing for, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and we are obligated under the merger agreement to have sufficient funds available to satisfy our obligations under the merger agreement. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions required under our financing commitments or any definitive financing documentation, we may not have available the funds necessary to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration. In addition, one or more financing sources under the financing commitments may default on its obligation to provide the financing and the commitments of any such defaulting financing source may not be replaced on a timely basis. Any such failure to have available the necessary funds to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration could delay or prevent the completion of the merger.\nWe will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the merger.\nWe expect to incur significant costs in connection with consummating the merger. In addition, we expect to incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the merger as we integrate the businesses of the two companies. There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction, integration and restructuring costs over time. We will also incur significant fees and expenses relating to the financing arrangements in connection with the merger, as well as significant legal, financial advisor, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the merger is completed.\nFurther, upon consummation of the merger, all MPG stock options and restricted shares will be accelerated and any unvested awards will vest at the effective time of the merger. Upon closing, we will record a one-time charge to earnings for the acceleration of these awards equal to the fair value on the closing date of the unvested portion of the awards that were accelerated and vested as a result of the merger.\nThe merger agreement restricts our conduct of business prior to the completion of the merger and limits our ability to pursue an alternative acquisition proposal to the merger.\nUnder the merger agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completing the merger, which restrictions may adversely affect our ability to exercise certain business strategies. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.\nIn addition, the merger agreement prohibits us from (A) soliciting, initiating, facilitating or encouraging any inquiry, proposal or offer relating to alternative business combination transactions, or (B) engaging in discussions or negotiations regarding, or providing any nonpublic information in connection with, proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement. In certain circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, we would be required to pay a termination fee to MPG ranging from $50,897,000 to $101,794,000, depending on the circumstances giving rise to the right to terminate the merger agreement, and we would be required to reimburse MPG for its transaction-related expenses, subject to a $15 million limit (provided that the amount of any expenses paid by us to MPG will be credited against any termination fee to be paid by us if the termination fee subsequently becomes payable). These provisions may limit our ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater value to our stockholders than the value resulting from the merger. The termination fee may also discourage third parties from pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal with us, or might result in third parties proposing to pay a lower value per share to acquire us than it might otherwise have been willing to pay.\nWhile the merger is pending, we will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause our customers, suppliers and other business partners to delay or defer certain business decisions or to seek to change existing business relationships with us. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger because employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite our retention efforts, key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the companies as combined, our business could be seriously harmed. Any delay in completing the merger may further increase such uncertainties and the adverse effects related thereto.\nFailure to complete the merger could materially and adversely impact our financial conditions, results of operations or stock price.\nAs described above, the conditions to the completion of the merger may not be satisfied. If the merger is not completed for any reason, we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nbeing required to pay a termination fee ranging from $50,897,000 to $101,794,000 under certain circumstances provided in the merger agreement;\n\u2022\nbeing required to reimburse MPG for certain fees and expenses relating to the merger, such as legal, financial advisor, accounting, banking, consulting and printing fees and expenses up to $15 million under certain circumstances provided in the merger agreement (provided that the amount of any expenses paid to MPG will be credited against any termination fee to be paid by us if the termination fee subsequently becomes payable);\n\u2022\nhaving had the focus of management diverted from day-to-day operations and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nthe market prices of our shares of common stock might decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed;\n\u2022\ncustomers and suppliers may seek to modify their relationship with us and our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees may be harmed by the failure to complete the merger;\n\u2022\nbeing subject to potential litigations related to a failure to complete the merger or to enforce our obligations under the merger agreement; and\n\u2022\nif we seek out another merger or business combination following termination of the merger agreement, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger agreement with MPG.\nAny such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nWe will incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with financing the merger.\nFollowing the merger, on a combined basis, we will have substantial additional indebtedness and related debt service obligations. This additional indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nreducing flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and the industries in which we operate, and to technological and other changes;\n\u2022\nlowering credit ratings;\n\u2022\nreducing access to capital and increasing borrowing costs generally or for any additional indebtedness to finance future operating and capital expenses and for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nreducing funds available for operations, capital expenditures and other activities; and\n\u2022\ncreating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nOur stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in AAM after the merger and will exercise less influence over the board of directors, management and policies of AAM.\nOur stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the AAM board of directors and on other matters affecting AAM. Since new shares of our common stock will be issued to MPG stockholders in connection with the completion of the merger, each AAM stockholder's percentage ownership of AAM will be smaller than such stockholder's percentage ownership of AAM prior to the merger. Because of this, current AAM stockholders, as a group, may have less influence on the board of directors, management and policies of AAM than they now have on the board of directors, management and policies of AAM.\nThe merger will result in changes to the AAM board of directors that may affect the strategy and operations of the combined company as compared to that of AAM as it currently exists.\nIf the merger is completed, the composition of the AAM board of directors will change. Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of eleven members, including three new members designated by American Securities, LLC (the controlling stockholder of MPG). There can be no assurance that the newly constituted board of directors of the combined company will function effectively as a team and that there will not be any adverse effect on the combined company's business as a result.\nThe obligations and liabilities of MPG, some of which may be unanticipated or unknown, may be greater than anticipated, which may diminish the value of our shares.\nMPG's obligations and liabilities, some of which may be unanticipated or unknown, may be greater than anticipated or reflected or reserved for in MPG's historical financial statements. The obligations and liabilities of MPG could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations following the merger. Any such liabilities could substantially reduce our earnings and cash flows or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations following the merger.\nThe merger may result in a loss of customers, clients, suppliers and strategic alliances.\nSome of the customers, clients, suppliers, potential customers or clients or strategic partners of AAM or MPG may terminate their business relationship with AAM or MPG following the merger. Potential clients, suppliers, or strategic partners may delay entering into, or decide not to enter into, a business relationship with AAM or MPG because of the merger. Further, certain of MPG's existing customer contracts may require the purchaser's consent to the change of control of MPG, and there can be no assurance that such consent will be forthcoming. If customer, supplier or client relationships or strategic alliances are adversely affected by the merger, our business and financial performance following the merger could suffer.", "PERMNO": 86547, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "AXL"}
