Risk Factors\nPRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF\nSAFE HARBOR CAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including exhibits, contains statements that are not based on historical facts and represent forward-looking statements, as this term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that TDS intends, expects, projects, believes, estimates, plans or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying them. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, events or developments to be significantly different from any future results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include those set forth below under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Each of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on TDS; however, such factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. TDS undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K to understand the material risks relating to TDS\u2019 business.\nRISK FACTORS\n1) Intense competition in the markets in which TDS operates could adversely affect TDS\u2019 revenues or increase its costs to compete.\nCompetition in the telecommunications industry is currently intense and could intensify further in the future due to the general effects of the economy, as well as due to multiple wireless industry factors such as increasing market penetration, decreasing customer churn rates, introduction of new products, new competitors and changing prices. There is competition in handsets and other devices; network quality, coverage, speed and technologies; distribution; pricing; and other categories. TDS\u2019 ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the telecommunications industry. TDS anticipates that, in the future, competition may cause the prices for products and services to continue to decline and the costs to compete to increase. Most of TDS\u2019 competitors are national or global telecommunications companies that are larger than TDS, possess greater resources, possess more extensive coverage areas and more spectrum within their coverage areas, and market other services with their communications services that TDS does not offer. In addition, TDS may face competition from technologies that may be introduced in the future or from new entrants into the industry. New technologies, services and products that are more commercially effective than the technologies, services and products offered by TDS may be developed. Further, new technologies may be proprietary such that TDS is not able to adopt such technologies. There can be no assurance that TDS will be able to compete successfully in this environment.\nSources of competition to TDS\u2019 wireless business typically include two to four competing wireless telecommunications service providers in each market, wireline telecommunications service providers, cable companies, resellers (including mobile virtual network operators), and providers of other alternate telecommunications services. Many of TDS\u2019 wireless competitors and other competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources than TDS.\nTDS\u2019 competitors offer a wide array of wireless service offerings and wireless devices. There is increasing complexity associated with these wireless product and service offerings and the related pricing. Further, new wireless services and products and pricing structures are frequently introduced. Multiple events related to new services, products and pricing offered by TDS\u2019 competitors occurring simultaneously or in close proximity may impact TDS\u2019 ability to respond to such events and compete effectively.\nSources of competition to TDS\u2019 Wireline business include, but are not limited to, resellers of local exchange services, interexchange carriers, Regional Bell Operating Companies (\u201cRBOCs\u201d), satellite transmission service providers, wireless communications providers, cable companies, competitive access service providers, competitive local exchange carriers, Voice over Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) providers and providers using other emerging technologies. The Wireline CLEC business sources of competition include the sources identified above as well as the ILEC in each market, which enjoys competitive advantages, including its wireline connection to virtually all of the customers and potential customers of Wireline\u2019s CLEC business, its established brand name and its substantial financial resources. Wireline\u2019s CLEC business is typically required to discount services to win potential customers. In the future, TDS expects the number of its physical access lines served to continue to be adversely affected by wireless and broadband substitution and by cable company competition.\n17</BCLPAGE>17\nSome of the specific risks presented by certain Wireline competitors include:\n\u00b7 Cable companies - continued deployment of technologies such as DOCSIS 3.0 and their further evolution that substantially increase data transfer speeds, and offering these speeds to customers at relatively low prices, including speed upgrades for no additional charge.\n\u00b7 Wireless - the trend of customers \u201csubstituting\u201d their wireline connection with a wireless device.\n\u00b7 RBOCs - continue to be formidable competitors given their full suite of services, experience and strong financial resources.\n\u00b7 VoIP providers - are able to offer voice service at a very low price point.\n\u00b7 Fiber overbuilders - municipalities or other providers offering the same or higher data speeds at similar or lower price points.\nTDS\u2019 Cable business also provides high-speed internet and digital voice services, as well as cable television service. With respect to internet and voice services, Cable\u2019s business faces sources of competition similar to the Wireline business. With respect to cable television service, cable operators compete against broadcast television, direct broadcast satellite providers, on-line video services and may compete against wireline providers which have begun to upgrade their networks to provide video services in addition to voice and high-speed internet access services. As a result, the cable business is highly competitive.\nSources of competition for HMS\u2019s business primarily include large diversified telecommunications and technology companies, as well as smaller independent companies that focus on mid-market companies. In addition, new entrants may emerge and grow rapidly creating additional sources of competition or companies may begin insourcing IT services. The IT services market is large and complex, with a diverse array of segments in which performance and market dynamics vary considerably. As a result of these dynamics the IT services market is a highly competitive environment. Therefore, the HMS business is increasingly required to assume greater potential contractual risk obligations, such as risks relating to the consequences of data breaches or unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, in order to win new customer engagements. In the event of such incidents, the HMS business could be materially adversely effected.\nIf TDS does not adapt to compete effectively in such a highly competitive environment, such competitive factors could result in product, service, pricing or cost disadvantages and could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n2) A failure by TDS to successfully execute its business strategy (including planned acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges) or allocate resources or capital could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular is a regional wireless carrier that operates on a customer satisfaction strategy, seeking to meet customer needs by providing a comprehensive range of wireless products and services, excellent customer support, and a high-quality network. U.S. Cellular seeks to operate controlling interests in wireless licenses in areas adjacent to or in proximity to its other wireless licenses, thereby building contiguous operating market areas. U.S. Cellular relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S. outside its service areas and to improve coverage within selected areas of U.S. Cellular\u2019s network footprint. U.S. Cellular pursues a product and technology strategy which requires it to recognize product and technology advances and quickly adopt and execute rollouts of such advances. This strategy requires U.S. Cellular to make timely and effective strategic decisions related to technological advances and related products and services, and which of these technological advances to adopt and roll out to its customers.\nFurther, U.S. Cellular\u2019s strategic decisions related to the adoption of new technologies are ultimately impacted by such factors as consumer preferences for technologies and the related services and products, and original equipment manufacturer (\u201cOEM\u201d) and standard bodies support of such technologies, including Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) and VoLTE, among other factors. If U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors adopt new technologies faster than U.S. Cellular, then consumers who are eager to adopt new technologies more quickly may select U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors rather than U.S. Cellular as their service provider. These customers who are early adopters of new technologies are often customers who generate higher average revenue per unit (\u201cARPU\u201d), and to the extent that U.S. Cellular does not attract these types of customers, U.S. Cellular could be at a competitive disadvantage and have a customer base that generates lower overall ARPU relative to its competition.\nWireline\u2019s business seeks to be the preferred telecommunications solutions provider in its chosen markets for both residential and commercial customers by developing and delivering high-quality products that meet or exceed customers\u2019 needs and to outperform the competition by maintaining superior customer service. Wireline\u2019s residential customer strategy is to provide broadband, video and voice services through value-added bundling of products and services. The commercial focus is to provide advanced IP-based voice and data services. Wireline is selectively investing in the continuing transformation of its legacy circuit-switched network to a highly reliable IP-based broadband network to economically deploy advanced technologies and new services. Wireline continues to actively advocate for state and federal regulatory frameworks that enable its operations to grow and invest profitably and continue to meet customer expectations for new and improved services.\n18</BCLPAGE>18\nCable\u2019s business provides broadband, video and voice services. Although similar to Wireline, the strategies for Cable involve different technical, regulatory, business and other factors and TDS has limited experience in operating cable companies. In particular, Cable\u2019s business has significant costs and risks relating to programming and retransmission. Such costs have been increasing and Cable\u2019s business may not be able to fully pass these costs on to customers. In addition, Cable\u2019s business is limited in its ability to obtain programming at favorable costs and terms due to its small scale. Also, Cable\u2019s business may be affected by a wide range of regulatory or other issues, including matters pertaining to set-top boxes, equipment connectivity, content regulation, closed captioning, pole attachments, privacy, copyright, technical standards, and municipal entry into video and broadband. Further, changes in consumer behavior and/or new technologies could cause consumers to reduce or cancel their cable video services and instead seek to obtain video on demand over the internet or through new technologies. Cable\u2019s business development strategy also includes evaluating opportunities for possible further acquisitions of desirable cable companies on attractive terms to increase the scale of Cable\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that TDS will be successful in its Cable business strategy.\nHMS\u2019s business development strategy is to increase its presence in the IT infrastructure and application outsourcing and solution provider market through organic growth, expansion or acquisition. HMS\u2019s service platform with coverage across all of its product categories provides the potential for expansion of current products and services to additional markets in or near HMS\u2019s current footprint. HMS may continue to make opportunistic acquisitions of companies that further strengthen its operating market areas and enter additional attractive markets.\nThe successful execution of strategies, the optimal allocation within TDS\u2019 portfolio of assets and optimal capital allocation decisions depend on various internal and external factors, many of which are not in TDS\u2019 control. TDS\u2019 ability to implement and execute its business strategies and optimally allocate its assets and capital and, as a result, achieve desired financial results, could be affected by such factors. Such factors include pricing practices by competitors, relative scale, purchasing power, roaming and other strategic agreements, wireless device availability, timing of introduction of wireless devices and other factors. In addition, there is no assurance that U.S. Cellular\u2019s or TDS Telecom\u2019s strategies will be successful. Even if TDS executes its business strategies as intended, such strategies may not be successful in the long term to profitably sustain growth in revenues or otherwise.\nA failure by TDS to execute its business strategies successfully or to allocate resources or capital optimally could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\n3) TDS offers customers the option to purchase certain devices under installment contracts, which creates certain risks and uncertainties which could have an adverse impact on TDS' financial condition or results of operations.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2014, U.S. Cellular expanded its offerings of equipment installment plans. Such plans offer customers the option to purchase certain devices under installment contracts over a period of up to 24 months. TDS expects that sales of devices under these plans, when compared to sales of devices made under the traditional subsidy model, will reduce retail service revenue and ARPU but increase equipment revenue. Such plans also are expected to result in lower cash flows from operating activities in the near term. However, at this time, TDS does not have significant experience in these new plans or a sufficient history to determine how these plans will affect TDS\u2019 business, financial position or results of operations.\nCompared to equipment sales made under the traditional subsidy model, these equipment installment plans involve different business risks and accounting considerations. These plans could adversely impact bad debts expense, marketing expense, customer churn, cash flows, inventory valuation, and other financial results and metrics.\n4) Changes in roaming practices or other factors could cause TDS\u2019 roaming revenues to decline from current levels and/or impact TDS\u2019 ability to service its customers in geographic areas where TDS does not have its own network, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 revenues include roaming revenues related to the use of TDS\u2019 network by other wireless carriers\u2019 customers who travel within TDS\u2019 coverage areas. Changes in the network footprints of carriers due to mergers, acquisitions or network expansions could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 roaming revenues. For example, consolidation among other carriers which have network footprints that currently overlap TDS\u2019 network could decrease the amount of roaming revenues for TDS.\nSimilarly, TDS\u2019 wireless customers can access another carrier\u2019s digital system automatically only if the other carrier allows TDS\u2019 customers to roam on its network. TDS relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S., Mexico and Canada outside of its service areas and to improve coverage within selected areas of TDS\u2019 network footprint. Such agreements cover traditional voice services as well as data services. Although TDS currently has long-term roaming agreements with certain other carriers, these agreements generally are subject to renewal and termination if certain events occur. FCC rules and orders impose certain requirements on wireless carriers to offer certain roaming arrangements to other carriers. However, carriers frequently disagree on what is required. Also, at this time, there is no assurance that TDS will be able to enter into agreements to provide roaming services using 4G LTE or other technologies or that it will be able to do so on reasonable or cost\n19</BCLPAGE>19\neffective terms. In addition, see Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section \u201cRegulatory Matters - FCC Interoperability Order\u201d for further information and developments.\nSome competitors may be able to obtain lower roaming rates than TDS is able to obtain because they have larger call volumes or may be able to reduce roaming charges by providing service principally over their own networks. In addition, the quality of service that a wireless carrier delivers during a roaming call may be inferior to the quality of service TDS provides, the price of a roaming call may not be competitive with prices of other wireless carriers for such call, and TDS\u2019 customers may not be able to use some of the advanced features, such as voicemail notification or data applications, that TDS customers enjoy when making calls on TDS\u2019 network. TDS\u2019 rate of adoption of new technologies, such as those enabling high-speed data services, could affect its ability to enter into or maintain roaming agreements with other carriers. In addition, TDS\u2019 wireless technology may not be compatible with technologies used by other carriers, which may limit the ability of TDS to enter into voice or data roaming agreements with such other carriers. TDS\u2019 roaming partners could switch their business to new operators or, over time, to their own networks. Changes in roaming usage patterns, rates for roaming minutes or data usage or relationships with carriers whose customers generate roaming minutes or data use on TDS\u2019 network could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 revenues and revenue growth.\nTo the extent that TDS\u2019 key roaming partners expand their networks in TDS\u2019 service areas, the roaming arrangements between TDS and these key roaming partners could become less strategic for the roaming partners. That is, these key roaming partners will have fewer or less extensive geographic areas where roaming services are required by their customers and, as a result, the roaming arrangements could become less critical to serving their customer base. This presents a risk to TDS in that, to the extent TDS is not able to enter into economically viable roaming arrangements with key roaming partners, this could impact TDS\u2019 ability to service its customers in geographic areas where TDS does not have its own network.\nIf TDS\u2019 roaming revenues decline, or if TDS is unable to obtain or maintain roaming agreements with other wireless carriers that contain pricing and other terms that are competitive and acceptable to TDS, and that satisfy TDS\u2019 quality and interoperability requirements, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n5) A failure by TDS to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 wireless business depends on the ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. TDS could fail to obtain access to sufficient spectrum capacity in new or existing critical markets, whether through FCC auctions or other transactions, in order to meet the anticipated spectrum requirements associated with increased demand for existing services, especially increases in customer demand for data services, and to enable deployment of next-generation services. TDS believes that this increased demand for data services reflects a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future; as such, TDS could fail to accurately forecast its future spectrum requirements considering changes in customer usage patterns, technology requirements and the expanded demands of new services. Such a failure could have an adverse impact on the quality of TDS\u2019 services or TDS\u2019 ability to roll out such future services in some markets, or could require that TDS curtail existing services in order to make spectrum available for next-generation services. Spectrum constrained providers could be effectively capped in increasing market share. As spectrum constrained providers gain customers, they use up their network capacity. Since they lack spectrum, they can respond to demand only by adding cell sites, which is capital intensive, limited by zoning considerations, and ultimately may not be cost effective. TDS may acquire access to spectrum through a number of alternatives, including participation in spectrum auctions, partnering on a non-controlling basis with other auction applicants (\u201cOther Applicants\u201d) and other acquisitions and exchanges. As required by law, the FCC has conducted auctions for licenses to use some parts of the radio spectrum. The decision to conduct auctions, and the determination of what spectrum frequencies will be made available for auction and the determination of geographic size of licenses, are made by the FCC pursuant to laws that it administers. The FCC may not be able to allocate spectrum sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain licenses for new market entry or to expand their spectrum holdings to meet the expanding demand for data services or to address other spectrum constraints. Due to factors such as geographic size of licenses and auction bidders that may raise prices beyond acceptable levels, TDS or Other Applicants may not be successful in FCC auctions in obtaining the spectrum that either believes is necessary to implement its business and technology strategies. In addition, newly auctioned spectrum may not be compatible with existing spectrum, and vendors may not create suitable products to use such spectrum. Further, access to use spectrum won in FCC auctions may not be available on a timely basis. Such access is dependent upon the FCC actually granting licenses won in the various auctions, which can be delayed for various reasons. Furthermore, newly licensed spectrum may not be available for immediate use since the radio operations of incumbent users, including in some cases government agencies, may need to be relocated to other portions of the radio spectrum, and/or the newly licensed spectrum may be subject to sharing and coordination obligations for a period of time. TDS also may seek to acquire radio spectrum through purchases and exchanges with other spectrum licensees. However, TDS may not be able to acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions, and TDS may not be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms.\n20</BCLPAGE>20\n6) To the extent conducted by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), TDS is likely to participate in FCC auctions of additional spectrum in the future as an applicant or as a noncontrolling partner in another auction applicant and, during certain periods, will be subject to the FCC\u2019s anti-collusion rules, which could have an adverse effect on TDS.\nFrom time to time, the FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services. TDS has participated in such auctions in the past and is likely to participate in other auctions conducted by the FCC in the future as an applicant or as a non-controlling partner in another auction applicant. FCC anti-collusion rules place certain restrictions on business communications and disclosures by participants in an FCC auction. These anti-collusion rules may restrict the normal conduct of TDS\u2019 business and/or disclosures by TDS relating to an FCC auction, which could last three to six months or more. The restrictions could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n7) Changes in the regulatory environment or a failure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any applicable regulatory requirements could adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, state public utility commissions and other federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. TDS is unable to predict the future actions of the various regulatory bodies that govern TDS, but such actions could have adverse effects on TDS\u2019 business. New or amended regulatory requirements could increase TDS\u2019 costs and divert resources from other initiatives.\nAdverse decisions, increased regulation, or changes to existing regulation by regulatory bodies could negatively impact TDS\u2019 operations by, among other things, changing the amount that can be charged for local, intrastate or interstate access rates, increasing TDS\u2019 costs of doing business, permitting greater competition or limiting TDS\u2019 ability to engage in certain sales or marketing activities. New regulatory mandates or enforcement may require unexpected or changed capital investment, lost revenues, changes in operations or other changes.\nCourt decisions and rulemakings could have a substantial impact on TDS\u2019 operations, including rulemakings on intercarrier access compensation, state and federal universal service, and treatment of VoIP traffic or unbundled network elements (\u201cUNEs\u201d). Litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and delay TDS\u2019 ability to respond to new regulations.\nTDS attempts to timely and fully comply with all regulatory requirements. However, this may not be possible due to various factors. Any failure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any regulatory requirements could adversely affect TDS\u2019 financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.\nFor additional information about TDS\u2019 regulatory environment, including the potential risk to a reduction in the current level of TDS\u2019 revenues as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier, see \u201cTDS - Regulation\u201d in this Form 10-K and Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d.\n8) An inability to attract people of outstanding potential, to develop their potential through education and assignments, and to retain them by keeping them engaged, challenged and properly rewarded could have an adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 businesses are highly technical and competition for skilled talent in the telecommunications and IT services industries is aggressive. Due to competition for qualified management, technical, sales and other personnel, there can be no assurance that TDS will be able to continue to attract and/or retain people of outstanding potential for the development of its business. The loss of the services of existing key personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified personnel in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n9) TDS\u2019 assets are concentrated primarily in the U.S. telecommunications industry. As a result, its results of operations may fluctuate based on factors related primarily to conditions in this industry.\nTDS\u2019 assets are concentrated primarily in the U.S. telecommunications industry and the United States. The U.S. telecommunications industry is facing significant change and an uncertain operating environment. Although TDS has diversified into HMS and the cable businesses, TDS\u2019 revenue streams continue to be substantially derived from telecommunications services, including wireless, wireline, broadband and internet services. TDS\u2019 focus on the U.S. telecommunications industry, together with its positioning relative to larger competitors with greater resources within the industry, may represent increased risk for investors due to the lack of diversification. This could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 ability to profitably sustain long-term revenue growth and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n10) TDS\u2019 lower scale relative to larger competitors could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n21</BCLPAGE>21\nThere has been a trend in the telecommunications, IT services and related industries in recent years towards consolidation of service providers through acquisitions, reorganizations and joint ventures. This trend could continue, leading to larger competitors over time. TDS has lower scale efficiencies compared to larger competitors. TDS may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources or that offer more services than TDS, which could adversely affect TDS\u2019 revenues and costs of doing business. Specifically, TDS\u2019 smaller scale relative to most of its competitors could have the following impacts, among others:\n\u00b7 Increased operating costs due to lack of leverage with vendors;\n\u00b7 Limited opportunities for strategic partnerships as potential partners are focused on wireless, wireline and cable companies with greater scale;\n\u00b7 Limited access to content and programming;\n\u00b7 Limited ability to influence industry standards;\n\u00b7 Reduced ability to invest in research and development of new products and services;\n\u00b7 Vendors may deem TDS non-strategic and not develop or sell products and services to TDS, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies;\n\u00b7 Limited access to intellectual property; and\n\u00b7 Other limited opportunities such as for software development or third party distribution.\nTDS\u2019 telecommunications businesses increasingly depend on access to content for data, music or video services and access to new wireless devices being developed by vendors. TDS\u2019 ability to obtain such access depends in part on other parties. If TDS is unable to obtain timely access to new content or wireless devices being developed by vendors, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the foregoing, TDS\u2019 lower scale relative to larger competitors could adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n11) Changes in various business factors could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in any of several factors could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 Demand for or usage of services, particularly data services;\n\u00b7 Customer preferences, including internet speed and type of wireless devices;\n\u00b7 Customer perceptions of network quality and performance;\n\u00b7 The pricing of services;\n\u00b7 Access to and cost of programming;\n\u00b7 The overall size and growth rate of TDS\u2019 customer base;\n\u00b7 Average revenue per customer;\n\u00b7 Penetration rates;\n\u00b7 Churn rates;\n\u00b7 Selling expenses;\n\u00b7 Net customer acquisition and retention costs;\n\u00b7 Customers\u2019 ability to pay for services and the potential impact on bad debts expense;\n\u00b7 Roaming agreements and rates;\n\u00b7 Third-party vendor support;\n\u00b7 The mix of products and services offered by TDS and purchased by customers; and\n\u00b7 The costs of providing products and services.\n12) Advances or changes in technology could render certain technologies used by TDS obsolete, could put TDS at a competitive disadvantage, could reduce TDS\u2019 revenues or could increase its costs of doing business.\nThe telecommunications and IT services industries are experiencing significant changes in technologies and services expected by customers. In the telecommunications industry, this is evidenced by evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new services and products, and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Widespread deployment of new technologies could cause the technology used on TDS\u2019 wireless networks and traditional circuit-switched telephone services to become less competitive or obsolete. Also, high speed wireless networks (\u201cwireless broadband\u201d) represent a product offering and opportunity for TDS\u2019 wireless business, but also represent a risk for TDS\u2019 Wireline and Cable businesses as customers may elect to substitute their wireline broadband connection for wireless\n22</BCLPAGE>22\nbroadband. Further, fixed-mobile convergence services that combine wireline broadband services with mobile services represent a competitive threat. In addition, the IT services market is characterized by rapidly changing technology and services. Future technological changes or advancements may enable other technologies to equal or exceed TDS\u2019 current levels of service and render its system infrastructure obsolete. TDS may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely or cost-effective basis, which could reduce its revenues or increase its costs of doing business. If TDS cannot keep pace with these technological changes or other changes in the telecommunications or IT services industries over time, its financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected.\n13) Complexities associated with deploying new technologies present substantial risk.\nTDS\u2019 wireless business has selected 4G LTE technology as its approach to address demand for services enabled by fourth generation wireless technology. The deployment of 4G LTE technology is impacted by a number of technical challenges.\nManufacturers of wireless devices (\u201cOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\u201d or \u201cOEMs\u201d) must design and manufacture equipment that operates on the frequency bands available to TDS. This may involve software and hardware support for such bands in wireless device chipsets as well as band-specific designs for components such as filters. OEMs, chipset manufacturers, and component manufacturers will likely prioritize the support of frequency bands that are specified by the largest wireless carriers. Given TDS\u2019 smaller scale relative to its competitors, certain bands of spectrum licensed to TDS and its affiliates in certain cases represent a lower priority for chipset and wireless device manufacturers. As a result, the timing and the availability of wireless devices to support TDS\u2019 continued 4G LTE roll out could be negatively impacted. In addition, due to TDS\u2019 relatively smaller scale, the cost of such equipment could be higher for TDS than for TDS\u2019 competitors.\nAdditionally, the efficiency of LTE networks and the peak speeds they can provide are optimized when the technology is deployed in larger channel bandwidths that, in early releases of LTE, require larger amounts of contiguous spectrum. To the extent that TDS\u2019 competitors have access to larger contiguous spectrum positions, they may be able to offer faster speeds or provision their networks more efficiently. In order for TDS to realize the same LTE data transfer speeds as competitors, it is important that both network infrastructure and device manufacturers support non-contiguous spectrum aggregation features for TDS.\nLack of wireless devices available to TDS to support its 4G LTE network, comparatively smaller spectrum positions for 4G LTE deployments, or carrier aggregation standards that result in TDS delivering slower 4G LTE data transfer speeds relative to its competitors, could have an adverse impact on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 Wireline business is deploying technologically advanced wireline services including advanced DSL, fiber optic and Very-high-speed digital subscriber line 2 (\u201cVDSL2\u201d) technologies. A significant amount of the product development and integration risks are borne by TDS. Further, the simultaneous rollout of these advanced services and technologies increases the execution risk. If TDS fails to effectively deploy new technologies and products on a timely basis, this could have an adverse impact on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCable\u2019s business is also subject to complexities associated with deploying new technologies and involves substantial risk, including rapid technology changes. If Cable\u2019s business does not respond appropriately to technology changes, its competitive position may be adversely affected.\nThe HMS business is also continuously evaluating and deploying advances in technology relating to IT services. If HMS fails to effectively deploy new technologies and products on a timely basis, this could have an adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n23</BCLPAGE>23\n14) TDS is subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments, and the applicability and the amount of these fees are subject to great uncertainty.\nTelecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services, including USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees. The division of services between interstate services and intrastate services, including the divisions associated with the federal USF fees, is a matter of interpretation and may in the future be contested by the FCC or state authorities. The FCC also may change in the future the basis on which federal USF fees are charged. The Federal government and many states also apply transaction-based taxes to sales of TDS products and services and to purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In addition, state regulators and local governments have imposed and may continue to impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on TDS services. The applicability of these surcharges and fees to its services is uncertain in many cases and jurisdictions may contest whether TDS has assessed and remitted those monies correctly. Periodically state and federal regulators may increase or change the surcharges and fees TDS currently pays. In some instances TDS passes through these charges to its customers. However, Congress, the FCC, state regulatory agencies or state legislatures may limit the ability to pass through transaction-based tax liabilities, regulatory surcharges and regulatory fees imposed on TDS to customers. TDS may or may not be able to recover some or all of those taxes from its customers and the amount of taxes may deter demand for its services or increase its cost to provide service which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results.\n15) Performance under device purchase agreements could have a material adverse impact on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS has entered into purchase commitments with certain vendors and may enter into similar purchase commitments with other vendors in the future. If TDS is unable to sell all of the devices that it is required to purchase under such agreements, or if it is unable to sell them at the prices it projects, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n16) Changes in TDS\u2019 enterprise value, changes in the market supply or demand for wireless licenses, wireline or cable markets or IT service providers, adverse developments in the businesses or the industries in which TDS is involved and/or other factors could require TDS to recognize impairments in the carrying value of its licenses, goodwill, franchise rights and/or physical assets.\nA large portion of TDS\u2019 assets consists of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the form of licenses, goodwill and franchise rights. TDS also has substantial investments in long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment. TDS reviews its licenses, goodwill, franchise rights and other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss may need to be recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets. The amount of any such impairment loss could be significant and could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 reported financial results for the period in which the loss is recognized. The estimation of fair values requires assumptions by management about factors that are uncertain including such things as future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate. Different assumptions for these factors could create materially different results.\n17) Costs, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges of properties or licenses and/or expansion of TDS\u2019 businesses could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of TDS\u2019 operating strategy, TDS from time to time may be engaged in the acquisition, divestiture or exchange of companies, businesses, strategic properties, wireless spectrum or other assets. TDS may change the markets in which it operates and the services that it provides through such acquisitions, divestitures and/or exchanges. In general, TDS may not disclose the negotiation of such transactions until a definitive agreement has been reached. These transactions commonly involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 Identification of attractive companies, businesses, properties, spectrum or other assets for acquisition or exchange, and/or the selection of TDS\u2019 businesses or assets for divestiture or exchange;\n\u00b7 Competition for acquisition targets and the ability to acquire or exchange businesses at reasonable prices;\n\u00b7 Possible lack of buyers for businesses or assets that TDS desires to divest and the ability to divest or exchange such businesses or assets at reasonable prices;\n\u00b7 Ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u00b7 Significant expenditures associated with acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u00b7 Legal and regulatory risks associated with new businesses or markets;\n\u00b7 Ability to enter markets in which TDS has limited or no direct prior experience and competitors have stronger positions;\n\u00b7 Ability to manage businesses that are engaged in activities other than traditional wireline and wireless service, including cable businesses and hosted and managed services businesses;\n\u00b7 Uncertain revenues and expenses associated with acquisitions, with the result that TDS may not realize the growth in revenues, anticipated cost structure, profitability, or return on investment that it expects;\n24</BCLPAGE>24\n\u00b7 Difficulty of integrating the technologies, services, products, operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, or of separating such matters for divested businesses or assets;\n\u00b7 Diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u00b7 Disruption of ongoing business;\n\u00b7 Impact on TDS\u2019 cash and available credit lines for use in financing future growth and working capital needs;\n\u00b7 Inability to retain key personnel;\n\u00b7 Inability to successfully incorporate acquired assets and rights into TDS\u2019 service offerings;\n\u00b7 Inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7 Possible conditions to approval by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Department of Justice; and\n\u00b7 Impairment of relationships with employees, customers or vendors.\nNo assurance can be given that TDS will be successful with respect to its acquisition, divestiture or exchange strategies or initiatives. If TDS is not successful with respect to its acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n18) TDS\u2019 investments in unproven technologies may not produce the benefits that TDS expects.\nTDS is making investments in various new technologies and service and product offerings. These investments include technologies for enhanced data service offerings, IPTV, cable and IT services. TDS expects new services, products and solutions based on these new technologies to contribute to future growth in its revenues. However, the markets for some of these services, products and solutions are still emerging and the overall potential for these markets remains uncertain. If customer demand for these new services, products and solutions does not develop as expected, TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n19) A failure by TDS to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its networks and support systems could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nTDS\u2019 business plan includes significant construction activities and enhancements to its network, support and other systems and infrastructure. In connection therewith, TDS must, among other things, continue to:\n\u00b7 Lease, acquire or otherwise obtain rights to cell and switch sites, data centers relating to IT services or other facilities;\n\u00b7 Obtain zoning variances or other local governmental or third-party approvals or permits for network construction;\n\u00b7 Complete and update the radio frequency design, including cell site design, frequency planning and network optimization, for each of TDS\u2019 wireless markets; and\n\u00b7 Improve, expand and maintain customer care, network management, billing and other financial and management systems.\nAny difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in vendor equipment availability, technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, could delay expansion of operations and product capabilities in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. Failure to successfully build-out and enhance TDS\u2019 network, support facilities and other systems and infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies customer expectations, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\n20) Difficulties involving third parties with which TDS does business, including changes in TDS\u2019 relationships with or financial or operational difficulties of key suppliers or independent agents and third party national retailers who market TDS\u2019 services, could adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS has relationships with independent agents and third party national retailers who market TDS\u2019 services. If such relationships are seriously harmed or if such parties experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTDS depends upon certain vendors to provide it with equipment, services or content to continue its network construction and upgrades and to operate its business. TDS does not have operational or financial control over such key suppliers and has limited influence with respect to the manner in which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. If these key suppliers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy or experience other operational difficulties, they may be unable to provide equipment, services or content to TDS on a timely basis or cease to provide such equipment, services or content or otherwise fail to honor their obligations to TDS.\nRegulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries may affect some of TDS\u2019 suppliers. These regulations may limit the availability of conflict free minerals and, as a result, TDS may not be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices from its vendors who utilize such minerals in the manufacture\n25</BCLPAGE>25\nof products. In such cases, TDS may be unable to maintain and upgrade its network or provide products and services to its customers in a competitive manner, or could suffer other disruptions to its business. In that event, TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, operation of TDS\u2019 supply chain and management of its inventory require accurate forecasting of customer growth and demand, which has become increasingly challenging. If overall demand for wireless devices or the mix of demand for wireless devices is significantly different than TDS\u2019 expectations, TDS could face inadequate or excess supplies of particular models of wireless devices. This could result in lost sales opportunities or an excess supply of inventory. Either of these situations could adversely affect TDS\u2019 revenues, costs of doing business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2010, U.S. Cellular entered into agreements with a third party vendor to develop a Billing and Operational Support System (B/OSS). In 2014, U.S. Cellular entered into certain other agreements with such vendor that rearrange the structure under the original agreements, including arrangements pursuant to which U.S. Cellular now outsources certain support functions for its B/OSS to such vendor. Operational problems associated with the B/OSS, including any failure by the vendor to provide the required level of service under the outsourcing arrangements, could have adverse effects on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n21) TDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control, including equity investments and interests in certain variable interest entities. TDS\u2019 interests in such entities do not provide TDS with control over the business strategy, financial goals, network build-out plans or other operational aspects of these entities. TDS cannot provide assurance that these entities will operate in a manner that will increase or maintain the value of TDS\u2019 investments, that TDS\u2019 proportionate share of income from these investments will continue at the current level in the future or that TDS will not incur losses from the holding of such investments. Losses in the values of such investments or a reduction in income from these investments could adversely affect TDS\u2019 financial condition or results of operations.\n22) A failure by TDS to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology, or a material disruption thereof, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS relies extensively on its telecommunication networks and information technology to operate and manage its businesses, process transactions and summarize and report results. These networks and technology become obsolete over time and must be upgraded, replaced and/or otherwise enhanced over time. Enhancements must be more flexible and dependable than ever before. All of this is capital intensive and challenging. A failure by TDS to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe increased provision of data services including IPTV has introduced significant new demands on TDS\u2019 network and has also increased complexities related to network management. As it relates to Wireline\u2019s networks, the transition to new IP-based networks from well-established time-division multiplexing networks requires new support tools and technician skills. Further, this transition requires the use of more leased facilities and partnerships which require enhanced network monitoring and controls. The IP-based networks also generally require more electronics on customers\u2019 premises which introduces more technical risks and makes diagnostics and repairs more difficult.\nFurther, the increased provision of data services on TDS\u2019 networks has created an increased level of risk related to quality of service. This is due to the fact that many customers increasingly rely on data communications to execute and validate transactions. As a result, redundancy and geographical diversity of TDS\u2019 network facilities are critical to providing uninterrupted service. Also, the speed of repair and maintenance procedures in the event of network interruptions is critical to maintaining customer satisfaction. TDS\u2019 ability to maintain high quality, uninterrupted service to its customers is critical, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment and customers\u2019 ability to choose other service providers.\nIn addition, TDS\u2019 networks and information technology and the networks and information technology of vendors on which TDS relies are subject to damage or interruption due to various events, including power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, hackers and other cyber security risks, catastrophic events, natural disasters, errors or unauthorized actions by employees and vendors, flawed conversion of systems, disruptive technologies and technology changes.\n23) Cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations.\n26</BCLPAGE>26\nTDS experiences cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. TDS maintains administrative, technical and physical controls, as well as other preventative actions, to reduce the risk of security breaches. Although to date TDS has not experienced a material security breach, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a security breach stemming from future cyber-attacks. If TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 networks and information technology are not adequately adapted to changes in technology or are damaged or fail to function properly, and/or if TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 security is breached or otherwise compromised, TDS could suffer adverse consequences, including theft, destruction or other loss of critical and private data, including customer and/or employee data, interruptions or delays in its operations, inaccurate billings, inaccurate financial reporting, and significant costs to remedy the problems. If TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach of customer or other data, TDS may be required to expend significant resources and take various actions to address the problems, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, may be subject to fines, sanctions and litigation, and its reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. Such events may also cause TDS to fail to satisfy service level commitments or trigger contractual obligations to customers of its IT services. Any material disruption in TDS\u2019 networks or information technology, including security breaches, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n24) The market price of TDS\u2019 Common Shares is subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors.\nFactors that may affect the future market price of TDS\u2019 Common Shares include:\n\u00b7 General economic conditions, including conditions in the credit and financial markets;\n\u00b7 Industry conditions;\n\u00b7 Fluctuations in TDS\u2019 quarterly customer additions, churn rate, revenues, results of operations or cash flows;\n\u00b7 Variations between TDS\u2019 actual financial and operating results and those expected by analysts and investors; and\n\u00b7 Announcements by TDS\u2019 competitors.\nAny of these or other factors could adversely affect the future market price of TDS\u2019 Common Shares, or could cause the future market price of TDS\u2019 Common Shares to fluctuate from time to time.\n25) Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information, could require TDS to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires TDS to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. TDS bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information, could require TDS to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, if any, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n26) Disruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events could, among other things, impede TDS\u2019 access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets, declines in consumer confidence, increases in unemployment, declines in economic growth and uncertainty about corporate earnings could have a significant negative impact on the U.S. and global financial and credit markets and the overall economy. Such events could have an adverse impact on financial institutions resulting in limited access to capital and credit for many companies. Furthermore, economic uncertainties make it very difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Changes in economic conditions, changes in financial markets, deterioration in the capital markets or other factors could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n27) Uncertainty of TDS\u2019 ability to access capital, deterioration in the capital markets, other changes in market conditions, changes in TDS\u2019 credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its construction, development or acquisition programs.\n27</BCLPAGE>27\nTDS and its subsidiaries operate capital-intensive businesses. TDS has used internally-generated funds and has also obtained substantial funds from external sources to finance the build-out and enhancement of markets, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. TDS also may require substantial additional capital for, among other uses, acquisitions of providers of wireless or wireline telecommunications services, cable markets, IT services or other businesses, spectrum license or system acquisitions, system development and network capacity expansion. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will continue to be available to TDS or its subsidiaries on terms or at prices acceptable to TDS. Changes in TDS\u2019 credit ratings, uncertainty of access to capital for telecommunications companies, deterioration in the capital markets, reduced regulatory capital at banks which in turn limits their ability to borrow and lend, other changes in market conditions or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its construction, development and acquisition programs. Reduction of TDS\u2019 construction, development and acquisition programs likely would have a negative impact on TDS\u2019 consolidated revenues, income and cash flows.\n28) Settlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS is regularly involved in a number of legal and policy proceedings before the FCC and various state and federal courts. Such legal and policy proceedings can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel.\nThe assessment of legal and policy proceedings is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events. Additionally, amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or resolution of litigation and other contingencies may differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial statements. Depending on a range of factors, these or similar proceedings could impose restraints on TDS\u2019 current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.\n29) The possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional studies to the effect that radio frequency emissions from wireless devices and/or cell sites cause harmful health consequences, including cancer or tumors, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices such as pacemakers, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 wireless business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMedia reports and certain professional studies have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless devices may be linked to various health problems, including cancer or tumors, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. U.S. Cellular is a party to and may in the future be a party to lawsuits against wireless carriers and other parties claiming damages for alleged health effects, including cancer or tumors, arising from wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless devices or expose TDS to potential litigation. In addition, the FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt regulations in response to concerns about radio frequency emissions. Any resulting decrease in demand for wireless services, costs of litigation and damage awards or regulation could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, some studies have indicated that some aspects of using wireless devices while driving may impair drivers\u2019 attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to potential litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries, any of which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNumerous state and local legislative bodies have enacted or proposed legislation restricting or prohibiting the use of wireless devices while driving motor vehicles. These enacted or proposed laws or other similar laws, if passed, could have the effect of reducing customer usage and/or increasing costs, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n28</BCLPAGE>28\n30) Claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent TDS from using necessary technology to provide products or services or subject TDS to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS faces possible effects of industry litigation relating to patents, other intellectual property or otherwise, that may restrict TDS\u2019 access to devices for sale to customers. If technology that TDS uses in products or services were determined by a court to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another person, TDS could be precluded from using that technology and could be required to pay significant monetary damages. TDS also may be required to pay significant royalties to such person to continue to use such technology in the future. The successful enforcement of any intellectual property rights, or TDS\u2019 inability to negotiate a license for such rights on acceptable terms, could force TDS to cease using the relevant technology and offering services incorporating the technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that TDS\u2019 products or services infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the effort and attention of TDS\u2019 management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, TDS cannot give assurance that it would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Although TDS generally seeks to obtain indemnification agreements from vendors that provide it with technology, there can be no assurance that any claim of infringement will be covered by an indemnity or that TDS will be able to recover all or any of its losses and costs under any available indemnity agreements. Any claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent TDS from using necessary technology to provide its services or subject TDS to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n31) Certain matters, such as control by the TDS Voting Trust and provisions in the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and the TDS bylaws contain provisions which may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS without the support of the TDS Voting Trust and the TDS Board of Directors or without meeting various other conditions.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of different series of common stock, which have different voting rights. The TDS Series A Common Shares have the power to elect approximately 75% (less one) of the directors and have ten votes per share in matters other than the election of directors. The TDS Common Shares (with one vote per share) vote as a separate group only with respect to the election of 25% (plus one) of the directors. In addition, the total percentage voting power in matters other than the election of directors of the Series A Common Shares and Common Shares are fixed, at 56.7% and 43.3%, respectively, subject to adjustment due to changes in the number of outstanding Series A Common Shares.\nA substantial majority of the outstanding TDS Series A Common Shares are held in the TDS Voting Trust which expires on June 30, 2035. The TDS Voting Trust was created to facilitate the long-standing relationships among the trustees\u2019 certificate holders. By virtue of the number of shares held by them, the voting trustees have the power to elect eight directors based on the current TDS Board of Directors\u2019 size of twelve directors, and control a majority of the voting power of TDS with respect to matters other than the election of directors.\nThe existence of the TDS Voting Trust is likely to deter any potential unsolicited or hostile takeover attempts or other efforts to obtain control of TDS and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell shares of TDS at higher than market prices. The trustees of the TDS Voting Trust have advised TDS that they intend to maintain the ability to keep or dispose of voting control of TDS.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, also authorizes the TDS Board of Directors to designate and issue TDS Undesignated Shares in one or more classes or series of preferred or common stock from time to time. Generally, no further action or authorization by the shareholders is necessary prior to the designation or issuance of the additional TDS Undesignated Shares authorized pursuant to the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, unless applicable laws or regulations would require such approval in a given instance. Such TDS Undesignated Shares could be issued in circumstances that would serve to preserve control of TDS\u2019 then existing management.\nIn addition, the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, includes a provision which authorizes the TDS Board of Directors to consider various factors, including effects on customers, taxes, and the long-term and short-term interests of TDS, in the context of a proposal or offer to acquire or merge the corporation, or to sell its assets, and to reject such offer if the TDS Board of Directors determines that the proposal is not in the best interests of the corporation based on such factors.\n29</BCLPAGE>29\nThe provisions of the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and the TDS bylaws and the existence of various classes of capital stock could prevent shareholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change in control of TDS by delaying or preventing such change in control.\n32) Any of the foregoing events or other events could cause revenues, earnings, capital expenditures and/or any other financial or statistical information to vary from TDS\u2019 forward-looking estimates by a material amount.\nFrom time to time, TDS may disclose forward-looking information, including estimates of future service revenues; various measures of income before income taxes; and/or capital expenditures. Any such forward-looking information includes consideration of known or anticipated changes to the extent disclosed, but dynamic market conditions and/or other unknown or unanticipated events, including but not limited to the risks discussed above, could cause such estimates to differ materially from the actual amounts.\n30</BCLPAGE>30", "PERMNO": 90655, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "TDS"}
